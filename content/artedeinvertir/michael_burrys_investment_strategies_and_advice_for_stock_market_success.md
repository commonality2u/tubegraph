## Early Career and Scion Capital

Perhaps surprisingly, [[History and investment style of Michael Burry | Michael Burry]] is a doctor by profession, combining his medical work with his passion for the stock market in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. He actively published his investment ideas and positive results on internet forums and blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This led some investors to offer him a million dollars to start his investment fund, leading to the creation of Scion Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Scion Capital's early results were impressive. During its first five years, the fund invested almost exclusively in stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Year 1 (2000)**: Generated an 8% return while the S&P 500 fell 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Year 2 (2001)**: Achieved a 55% return against an 11% S&P 500 decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Year 3 (2002)**: Rose 16% as the S&P 500 fell 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## The 2008 Crisis Prediction

In 2006, as depicted in *The Big Short*, [[History and investment style of Michael Burry | Michael Burry]]'s investment style underwent a radical change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. He shifted from buying stocks to investing his entire fund against the impending crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This period was challenging as his bet initially did not pay off, making investors nervous about the fund's radical shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

However, the crisis became evident in 2007 and 2008, and his significant bet yielded enormous benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. In 2007 alone, he achieved a 160% return, establishing him as a legend in the investment fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. He generated over $700 million in profits for his investors, and his personal fortune quickly exceeded $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. He achieved an accumulated return of 700% annually for his clients, making Scion Capital one of the most successful funds while he managed client money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## [[Michael Burrys investment strategy and theories | Key Investment Strategies and Advice]]

[[History and investment style of Michael Burry | Michael Burry]] was very active in forums and blogs in his early years as an investor, and his insights have been preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. He offers three main pieces of advice for successful stock market investing:

### 1. Contrarian Investing: Buying Ignored Companies

[[Michael Burrys investment strategy and theories | Michael Burry]]'s investment strategy is straightforward:
> "My investment strategy is not very complex. I try to buy shares in ignored companies when it seems that they are going to go bankrupt and I sell them when they have improved slightly. The management of my portfolio is so important like company selection. If I can do both well, I will be successful." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>

This advice explains his strong preference for the retail and energy sectors, which are currently out of fashion and where cheap companies are abundant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. If conditions improve or market fears subside, significant "regularizations" (likely meaning revaluations) could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### 2. Concentrated Portfolio Management

Regarding portfolio management, [[Michael Burrys investment strategy and theories | Michael Burry]] states:
> "I like to have between 12 and 18 stocks in my portfolio, homework depressed industries. I tend to always be invested this number of positions, I feel it gives me room to have my best ideas while smoothing out volatility so as not to confuse portfolio volatility with portfolio risk. And he adds ironically: you know I have this problem at heart and I don't want to have extra stress." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>

He prefers what is called a "concentrated portfolio," typically anything under 25 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This approach aligns with other great investors like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch, who advocate concentrating on high-conviction ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

### 3. Investing in Quality Companies at Good Prices

[[Michael Burrys investment strategy and theories | Michael Burry]] is also open to investing in high-quality companies:
> "I'm also delighted to add to the portfolio the companies that Warren Buffett likes with a competitive advantage, high return on capital if the market offers them at good prices." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>

This highlights his investment in Google, a classic example of a good company with a competitive advantage that Warren Buffett would approve of, especially when quoted at an attractive price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This demonstrates [[Michael Burrys investment strategy and theories | Michael Burry]]'s flexibility as an investor; he can quickly engage in both contrarian ideas and more popular companies if he identifies them as being reasonably priced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

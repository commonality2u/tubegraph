Warren Buffett, considered the greatest investor of all time, holds an annual conference closely followed by thousands of investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The 2020 edition, lasting over five hours, provided significant insights into his [[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | views]] and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Market Outlook: A Message of Caution

Warren Buffett has conveyed a strong message of caution, which is unusual for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This message is evident not only in his words but also in his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. During the first quarter of 2020, Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks and did not acquire new investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Increased Liquidity

Berkshire Hathaway's liquidity significantly increased from $120 trillion to over $130 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Buffett explained his market perspective for the coming months, acknowledging the unprecedented nature of voluntarily closing a substantial part of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Unlike the 2008 financial crisis where the economic train derailed due to banks, he has no reference for a similar event at present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

> "This is a great experiment, it has an enormous range of possibilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

While he remains convinced of the potential of the United States, as he was during WWII, the Cuban Missile Crisis, or the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, he constantly warned during the conference that in the short term, investors must be prepared for anything, as "very flying moments" might be approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. However, he insists that the long-term prospects, especially for the American stock market, remain intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Why No Buying?

When asked why he wasn't buying stocks, Buffett reflected on his 2008 experience:

> "During 2008 we would have been better off if I had waited four or five months, my timing was terrible in 2008, but what was available in the market was very attractive, and even though my timing was very bad, we came out in a good position" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

[[Warren Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]] often advises observers to pay attention to his actions rather than just his words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. His actions in Q1 2020 suggest he anticipates more volatility in the coming months, leading him to accumulate extra liquidity and wait for a more opportune time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This aligns with [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy_and_liquidity_accumulation | Warren Buffett's investment strategy and liquidity accumulation]].

## Key Investment Decisions

### Sale of Airline Stocks

A significant surprise from the conference was Buffett's decision to sell his entire position in the four major American airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This represented a combined investment of over $10 billion in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

He explained his reasoning:
> "People have been told not to fly, the airline business has changed significantly. I may be wrong, and I hope I'm wrong, but it's obviously changed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

He added that these four companies are going to borrow over $10 trillion each and will need to repay this money using future profits, or in some cases, by selling shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This drastically reduces their investment potential, and he believes it will take two to three years for passenger numbers to return to previous levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett]] noted that when he feels he has made a mistake in a position, he sells it completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

When the market learned of this sale, all airline stocks opened falling more than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Market Crash Clues

[[Warren Buffetts recent investment strategies and tips | Warren Buffett]] also offered clues about factors that could indicate a major market crash, similar to the Great Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. He noted that people in 1930 initially perceived the downturn as merely a recession, not recognizing it as the onset of the Great Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

History tends to repeat itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. In 1929, there was a huge market drop, partially recovered by fall 1930, leaving the market only 15% below its highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. However, this was followed by a "monstrous" 80% drop over the next two to three years, suggesting the true crisis began in 1930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

The major cause of the 1930s decline was the bankruptcy of over 4,000 banks, leading to widespread loss of savings <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Unlike today, mechanisms to prevent financial panic did not exist then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The last similar event was in 2008, causing a 60% market crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Therefore, monitoring the health of the financial system during market stress is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. [[Warren Buffetts recent statements and investments | Warren Buffett]] stated he is calm regarding the financial system and sees no stress within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. His main portfolio position remains in four large American banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Oil Market Outlook

Buffett's outlook on oil points to significant challenges:
> "We are going to have to store all the oil that has been produced in excess with low demand. The Russians and the Saudis are competing among themselves to see who produces the most oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

He noted that oil production in the U.S. is expected to drop significantly as it is not profitable to extract oil at current prices, especially below $40 a barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. As long as demand remains depressed, prices are unlikely to rise, which explains his lack of investments in oil companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Boeing's Financial Situation

[[Warren Buffetts investment insights during market crises | Warren Buffett]] also discussed Boeing's financial situation, highlighting how quickly its future changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

> "Boeing had to ask for 25 billion dollars two days ago and a short time ago it had already asked for another 14 billion dollars. Let's think that just a year ago they felt that they were in a solid financial position" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

He mentioned Airbus is in a similar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. While airplanes will still be flown, he questioned the future need for so many new aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Investment Examples (Not directly Buffett's buys, but analysis examples from the conference discussions)

### TSMC (TSM)

TSMC (TSM) is a leading company in microchip manufacturing, listed in the U.S. at around $50 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. It produces over 10,000 different products for 500 clients, including major corporations like AMD, Nvidia, and Apple (which accounts for over 17% of TSMC's income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

TSMC employs the "fabless" business model, focusing on manufacturing chips designed by other companies like Nvidia or Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. TSMC was an early adopter of this model and has developed an unmatched scale, which is crucial in the semiconductor sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Companies like Apple and AMD found it more profitable to outsource chip manufacturing to specialists like TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

While the semiconductor sector is typically cyclical, TSMC's competitive advantage has smoothed out its cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. For example, its profits increased by over 50% between 2007 and 2010, a challenging period for semiconductor companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

According to [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]], successful long-term investing requires investing in good companies at attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. TSMC exhibits strong financial health:
*   **Profit Margin:** A "gigantic" 40% on revenue, surpassing Intel's 30% operating profit margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** Consistently above 25%, significantly higher than the industry average of 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Debt:** TSMC has no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The current market situation barely affects it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

For 2020, TSMC is estimated to earn around $3 per share, trading at a P/E ratio of 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Assuming it grows at 10% annually (as it has in the past five years), earnings per share could reach $5 in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Historically, TSMC has traded at a P/E of 16. Multiplying this by $5 earnings per share suggests a future target price of $90 per share, an interesting potential given its current $50 price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### JP Morgan (JPM)

JP Morgan (JPM) is an American bank and a main position in [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett's portfolio]], listed at $90 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Unlike other banks that have struggled to return to pre-financial crisis levels, JP Morgan has grown more than 15 times on the stock market over the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

Banks are often seen as "black boxes" due to the difficulty for outside investors to assess loan quality and balance sheet solidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This necessitates a high level of confidence in the management team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. Warren Buffett has praised Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, as "probably one of the best and most trustworthy managers in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

A key metric to evaluate a bank is its Return on Equity (ROE), calculated by dividing profit by equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. JP Morgan is an undisputed leader among major American banks in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

[[Warren Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]] provided guidance on valuing JP Morgan:
> "A business that earns 15.6, 17 percent on its tangible equity is incredible. In a world of 3% bonds, simply imagine that you have an account deposited at JP Morgan and by mistake they pay you 15% on that deposit. And you can also withdraw the money. How much would you sell that account for? You're not going to sell it for 100 cents on the dollar, or 200 cents on the dollar, let alone 300 cents on the dollar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
> He added that an instrument compounding capital at 15% for 10 years, using added capital, is worth "much more than three times book value" at current interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

This implies valuing bank stocks at Price to Book Value (P/BV) instead of Price to Earnings (P/E) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. JP Morgan's tangible book value is $60 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Buffett suggests a current price should be three times this book value, leading to a target price of $180 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. In the long term, if book value grows to $90 per share in the next five years, applying the three-times multiple would yield a future target price of $270 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. This represents significant potential given the current $90 share price for a high-quality bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. This valuation helps explain [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett's]] $8 billion investment in JP Morgan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

### Boeing (BA)

Boeing (BA), mentioned by [[Warren Buffetts recent statements and investments | Warren Buffett]] at the conference, is listed at $120 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Since going public in the 1960s, it has multiplied its value over 200 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

Boeing has experienced a sharp fall from nearly $400 to $120 per share due to two main problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>:
1.  **Current Problem:** Affecting demand for new aircraft for the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
2.  **737 MAX Design Issues:** Led to two terrible accidents in 2018 and 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

These factors rapidly shifted Boeing from a solvent company to one facing serious financial trouble, requiring almost $30 billion in debt and considering a U.S. government bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

While these problems are expected to be resolved—aviation should return to normal in 3-4 years as the current crisis dissipates, and design issues are common and solvable (e.g., the Boeing Dreamliner grounding in 2013) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>—the immediate future is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. Air traffic is estimated to fall by 20% in 2020 and not recover to pre-crisis levels until 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. This means reduced income and profits for Boeing and Airbus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, though a long-term view suggests recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

Analysts estimate Boeing could earn $12 per share by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. Historically, Boeing has traded at an average P/E of 20, suggesting a target price of $240 per share, an interesting potential for a three-year horizon given its current $120 price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

However, the significant debt Boeing has taken on increases risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. If the current problem extends into 2021 or 2022, the company might need to raise capital (diluting shares) or seek a government bailout, both of which would significantly reduce its future potential valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

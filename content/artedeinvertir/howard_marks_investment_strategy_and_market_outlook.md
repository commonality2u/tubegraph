Howard Marks is an internationally recognized fund manager, chairman, and co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management, one of the largest fund managers in the world. He has a personal fortune of two billion dollars, generated by investing his own money alongside his clients' funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:58">[02:57:58]</a>. Marks is renowned for successfully navigating various market periods, including bull and bear markets, and for having very limited losses during turbulent times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>. He began investing from scratch and has built his fortune through astute money management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:53">[02:54:53]</a>. His investment memos are highly instructive, almost comparable to those of [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy_and_market_outlook | Warren Buffett]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:04">[03:03:04]</a>.

## Current Market Outlook and Buying Strategy

Howard Marks believes it is a reasonable time to start buying assets, seeing opportunities in the current market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. In a recent article from June 28th, he stated he was "starting to behave in an aggressive manner" regarding markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:17">[02:51:17]</a>. He suggests that if an asset continues to fall after an initial purchase, it's a good strategy to buy more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:57">[02:53:57]</a>. He emphasizes that nobody, not even the best investors, can intuit or know when the market will rebound or when it will reach its bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:47">[02:54:47]</a>.

> "I don't know when we will reach the market bottom," he adds. "Notice that even one of the best investors in the world tells you that nobody or you cannot intuit, you can intuit more or less at best what can happen when the market can stop falling, but you can't know when it's going to rebound or when that rise is going to occur." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:47">[02:54:47]</a>

He advises that if an investor finds a cheap asset they have been following, know its prospects are good, and it is not cyclical, they should start buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:58">[02:55:58]</a>. The key is not to obsess over knowing when the crisis will end, as this generates anxiety and can paralyze investors from taking opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:04">[02:57:04]</a>. His approach is to invest in assets that are "cheaper than 6 or 12 months ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:54">[02:58:54]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy and Market Dynamics

Marks does not claim the market is at its absolute bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:29">[03:01:29]</a>. His strategy aligns with the idea that crises are cyclical, and historically, markets always recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:02">[03:03:02]</a>. He looks for opportunities when "the market offers [things] much cheaper than a while ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:09">[03:03:09]</a>.

His perspective on [[bear_market_strategies_and_longterm_investment_opportunities | bear market strategies and longterm investment opportunities]] and [[stock_market_trends_and_investment_strategies | stock market trends and investment strategies]] emphasizes adapting to future conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. He highlights the importance of being prepared with knowledge to take advantage of market opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Portfolio Holdings and Investment Types

Howard Marks' portfolio, which is public, shows diverse holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. It includes:
*   **Maritime transport companies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>
*   **Utility companies:** These are generally calmer stocks compared to the broader market, suitable for turbulent times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Financial stocks:** These are expected to perform well during periods of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Oil and gas producing companies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

## Specific Examples of Investments

### Chesapeake Energy Holding
Marks' portfolio includes Chesapeake Energy Holding, an oil and gas company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This company had previously gone bankrupt during a bearish cycle in oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. It is a major producer of gas in the US, benefiting from increased exports to Europe and Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. While the price of gas has seen corrections, the company's fundamentals are strong, with expectations to generate significant profits until 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. These companies are cyclical, but Marks notes that Chesapeake expects to return most of its earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. Valuations in the oil and gas sector are generally lower than for higher-quality businesses like Transunion, as the market recognizes their cyclical nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

### Ally Financial (Ally)
Another company in Marks' portfolio is Ally Financial, a spin-off from General Motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. Historically, spin-off companies have offered interesting investment themes and good returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Ally Financial, while not having an exceptional competitive advantage, is not as cyclical as an automobile company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. It operates in:
*   **Automobile financing:** They provide car loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   **Insurance sales:** They offer insurance policies alongside car purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   **Ally Bank:** They run a bank where customers can deposit money, offering slightly higher interest rates than traditional banks, which they then lend out for car loans at a higher return (e.g., 7%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
This business model has shown growth and a good return on invested capital (ROIC) of over 20%, which is high for a financial company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. They also engage in wealth management and have started offering mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. The company has seen significant client growth in Ally Bank, from 1 million in 2016 to 2.4 million now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

> #### What Howard Marks looks for
> When comparing Ally to traditional banks, Marks notes that Ally's return on equity (ROE) is double that of typical Spanish banks (6-8%), reflecting a more lucrative business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. He looks for how the book value per share evolves, emphasizing the importance of per-share metrics to avoid being misled by companies issuing many shares to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Ally's book value per share has grown from $22 in 2014 to $38 by the end of last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. The company uses share buybacks or dividends to return capital to shareholders, contributing to an increase in earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

## Broader Market Sentiment and [[investment_advice_and_strategies_from_top_investors | Investment Advice]]

Marks's approach and that of other top investors like [[key_investments_and_strategies_by_top_investors_like_warren_buffett_and_bill_ackman | Warren Buffett]] and [[bill_ackmans_investment_strategies_and_portfolio | Bill Ackman]] align with the idea that in inflationary or turbulent economic periods, a combination of good businesses and good valuations is a winning formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. These "good businesses" often have "pricing power," allowing them to pass on cost increases to clients and maintain profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

Despite the current market negativity, characterized by low positioning of asset managers in futures (at 2%, lower than March 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, Marks implies that such extreme negativity often precedes market rebounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Historically, when positioning is very low (e.g., 2011, 2015-2016, 2020), it has been a good time to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. However, he notes that unlike previous crises (2015, 2018, 2020), there isn't yet a significant outflow of money from the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### Bill Ackman's perspective on fast food
[[bill_ackmans_investment_strategies_and_predictions | Bill Ackman]] is heavily invested in fast food businesses due to their pricing power and low-cost products, which perform well during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

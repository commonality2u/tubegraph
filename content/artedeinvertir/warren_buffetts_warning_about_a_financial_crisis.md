[[Warren Buffett's market insights and strategies | Warren Buffett]], often called "the greatest investor of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, is reportedly preparing for a financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. He has broken his silence to issue an important warning message to all [[investor_advice_and_insights_from_warren_buffett | investors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Such messages are rare from [[Warren Buffett's market insights and strategies | Buffett]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Historical Precedent for Warnings

[[Warren Buffett's market insights and strategies | Warren Buffett]] has issued similar warnings only twice before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. On both prior occasions, the stock market and economy suffered significant setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, with the market falling over 40% and major recessions occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

The first instance was at the beginning of his career as an investment fund manager (partnerships) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. After 13 successful years with annual returns exceeding 30%, he declared that the economy faced significant challenges and stock market valuations were very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Despite widespread optimism, [[Warren Buffett's market insights and strategies | Buffett]] accumulated cash and eventually returned all money to his [[investor_advice_and_insights_from_warren_buffett | investors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Shortly after, the stock market fell 20% and accumulated nearly 50% declines over four years, leading to a major recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

The second warning came in 1999, 30 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. [[Warren Buffett's market insights and strategies | Buffett]] warned of "enormous euphoria" in the stock market, unsustainable valuations, and significant economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Six months after his warning, the internet bubble ended, major stock markets plummeted over 45%, and the Nasdaq fell over 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. U.S. and European economies entered a recession 12 months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

We are now witnessing his third warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## [[Warren Buffett's market insights and strategies | Buffett]]'s Current Actions

[[Warren Buffett's market insights and strategies | Warren Buffett]] is taking drastic measures by rapidly selling stocks to build up a cash cushion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, currently holds over $300 billion in liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This amount is so substantial that he could buy 100% of companies like Netflix, Starbucks, McDonald's, or Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway is currently the most liquid and cash-rich company on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Stock Sales and Sector Adjustments

[[Warren Buffett's market insights and strategies | Buffett]] has been reducing his exposure to the financial and banking sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Notable sales include historic holdings in Bank of America and Wells Fargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. These sectors are highly sensitive to a potential [[economic_and_debt_crisis_warning | economic recession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

He has also significantly reduced his position in Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, sold off real estate companies, and no longer holds industrial sector companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. [[Warren Buffett's market insights and strategies | Buffett]] was reportedly looking for a buyer for his real estate agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Strategic Investments

One of the few sectors where [[Warren Buffett's market insights and strategies | Buffett]] has expanded positions is energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, purchasing shares in Chevron and Occidental Petroleum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This aligns with studies indicating the energy sector would be one of the least affected in an [[economic_and_debt_crisis_warning | economic recession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## Reasons for [[Warren Buffett's market insights and strategies | Buffett]]'s Caution

[[Warren Buffett's market insights and strategies | Warren Buffett]] has expressed a negative short- and medium-term outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

In his last conference, he stated:
> "Given the current circumstances, I am comfortable increasing my cash and liquidity position. When I look at the alternative of investing in the stock market with everything that is happening in the world, it is not an attractive option for me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>

He points to several issues:
*   **Global Events**: Current tariff problems, conflicts between China and the United States, and financial market speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Inflation**: Problems of [[warren_buffetts_perspectives_on_inflation_and_economic_crises | inflation]] are also a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **High Valuations**: He believes current stock valuations are very high relative to the risks, making them unattractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. He prefers to keep money in liquidity, earning 5% while waiting for better future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Limited Investment Opportunities**: In a recent letter to [[investor_advice_and_insights_from_warren_buffett | investors]], he stated: "currently, the prices of businesses with good long-term characteristics are sky-high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Market Multiples**: The stock market currently trades at 20 times earnings, compared to its historical average of 16 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Historically, [[Warren Buffett's market insights and strategies | Buffett]] has rarely paid more than 15 times earnings when initiating a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

### Support from Other Leaders

Jaime Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan and a personal friend of [[Warren Buffett's market insights and strategies | Warren Buffett]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, shares a similar vision for the future, stating that "The most likely outcome of the current crisis is an [[economic_and_debt_crisis_warning | economic recession]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## [[Warren Buffetts investment advice | Investment Advice]] for Small Investors

When asked what he would do as a small investor in the current environment of high stock market valuations, [[Warren Buffett's market insights and strategies | Warren Buffett]] responded:
> "I would probably focus on smaller companies where there's a greater chance of finding a good investment. If I had less than a million dollars today, I would be fully invested." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>

[[Warren Buffett's investment advice | Buffett]] recommends investing in lesser-known companies where the probability of finding a cheaply valued company is much higher, even in an expensive market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. While indexing (investing in famous companies like the S&P 500) has yielded strong results and is a valid long-term strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, expected returns for the S&P 500 over the next 10 years are projected to be very low, possibly below 5% or even 0% annually, due to high valuations (19 to 22 times earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

[[Warren Buffett's investment advice | Buffett]] himself made his fortune by selecting his own investments in these lesser-known companies, which have greater appreciation potential and are listed at more attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Small-cap valuations are currently attractive, trading at just 12 times earnings, a nearly 40% discount compared to larger indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

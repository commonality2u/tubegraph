A unique moment in the stock markets and the economy has been observed, with significant falls akin to the 2008 crisis, leading some media outlets to predict a new crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">00:00:01</a>. Additionally, oil has experienced its biggest fall in 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">00:00:14</a>. This article analyzes potential actions for investors, future expectations, and emerging [[investment_opportunities|investment opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">00:00:17</a>.

## Current Market Situation: "Black Monday"
What is known as "Black Monday" saw historic declines in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">00:00:40</a>. This event was compounded by Saudi Arabia's decision to increase oil production, causing oil prices to fall by nearly 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">00:00:44</a>. This triggered widespread panic among investors, leading to declines of up to 8% in the American stock market and 12% in the Italian stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">00:00:52</a>.

The U.S. had to activate the circuit breaker mechanism, a measure not used for several decades, which halts all stock trading when falls exceed 7% to allow investors to regain composure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">00:01:14</a>. Italy has completely halted trading, and Spain appears to be following suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">00:01:30</a>. Air traffic and global tourism have largely ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">00:01:37</a>.

### The Nature of the Current Crisis
The core issue with the current crisis is its origin as a consumer crisis, given that 70% of the economy relies on consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">00:01:55</a>. Companies with significant debt or high fixed costs have been the most affected in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">00:02:07</a>. Sectors like aviation, cruises, and tourism have seen dramatic declines, with examples including Norwegian Air SAD falling over 75%, American Airlines over 60%, and cruise companies also down 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">00:02:22</a>.

## [[strategies_for_protecting_investments_during_economic_crises | Strategies for Protecting Investments During Economic Crises]]
A crucial piece of advice for investors is to review their portfolios, particularly for highly indebted companies or those very sensitive to the economic cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">00:02:41</a>. It is important to check if companies have debt maturities in the near future (e.g., three to six months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">00:02:53</a>. A company not generating profits for a month or two due to quarantine does not necessarily mean bankruptcy if it has access to financing sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">00:03:00</a>.

Companies facing near-term debt maturities typically rely on:
*   **Liquidity elements:** Cash on the balance sheet or in banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">00:03:18</a>.
*   **Lines of credit:** To meet debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">00:03:27</a>.

If a company cannot generate profits to repay debt, options include issuing new shares (which can lead to significant dilution for shareholders) or, as a worse alternative, handing the company over to creditors, potentially wiping out shareholder investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">00:03:37</a>.

### Government and Central Bank Interventions
Most companies are prepared for such situations, with many capable of enduring one or two quarters without generating profits, possessing ready sources of financing or credit lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">00:04:03</a>. Following the 2008 crisis, governments and central banks recognized the need to inject liquidity into the economy or rescue troubled companies to prevent a chain reaction and higher overall costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">00:04:30</a>. Recent announcements from the Fed and the European Central Bank indicate significant liquidity injections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">00:04:52</a>. Governments are also offering aid, such as Norway's commitment to support its airline industry and the U.S. government's aid to the tourism, airline, and cruise sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">00:05:01</a>.

### Impact of Oil Price Collapse
The second catalyst for market falls has been the oil situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">00:05:17</a>. OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, sought a production cut with Russia to maintain oil prices amidst declining demand, but Russia refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">00:05:23</a>. Saudi Arabia then dramatically increased production to collapse prices and force Russia to negotiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">00:05:35</a>.

Initially, the market views oil price collapses negatively, as they can cause bankruptcies among weaker oil companies, especially when production is unprofitable below $40 a barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">00:05:47</a>. This can also create financial sector instability due to banks' exposure to these companies' debts, as seen in 2015-2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">00:06:04</a>. However, cheaper oil ultimately proves positive for the economy, increasing consumers' disposable income, given that consumption drives 70% of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">00:06:21</a>. Western economies generally benefit from lower oil prices, providing a "breath of fresh air" and greater disposable income in the medium and long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">00:06:52</a>. It is advised to avoid cyclical raw material companies due to the dual difficulty of predicting raw material prices and company performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">00:07:11</a>.

## General Investment Advice during Crises
The primary recommendation for investors is to avoid panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">00:07:43</a>. Selling at the worst possible moment is detrimental, and overexposure to news can lead to poor decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">00:07:48</a>. It is also important to check for companies with debt risk in one's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">00:07:54</a>.

### Warren Buffett's Wisdom
In an emergency interview after "Black Monday," Warren Buffett offered advice to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">00:08:02</a>. Known for accurate predictions, such as the dot-com bubble burst in 1999 and the good time to invest in equities in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">00:08:11</a>, Buffett stated that 2008 was far worse than the 1987 crash, and investors should focus on the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">00:08:31</a>.

Buffett's key advice:
1.  **Don't try to guess the market:** No one knows what the market will do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">00:08:41</a>. The focus should be on making intelligent purchases at current prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">00:08:48</a>.
2.  **Long-term decisions independent of current problems:** Buffett does not base long-term investment decisions on the immediate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">00:09:06</a>.
3.  **Invest in quality companies affected by the problem:** Just as he invested in banks during the 2008 crisis when others avoided them, Buffett is now buying shares of Delta Airlines, one of the companies most affected by the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">00:09:16</a>. He focuses on companies with solid balance sheets and strong positioning to navigate crises, such as Delta Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">00:09:50</a>, mirroring his investment in Bank of America during the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">00:10:09</a>.

## Examples of Investment Opportunities
Despite being at the epicenter of the problem (air transport and tourism), the following are quality companies with good long-term prospects that the market is offering at attractive prices during this transitory situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">00:10:22</a>:

### Aena
A Spanish company with a monopoly over the management of all Spanish airports, Aena is a highly profitable business with no competition that benefits from future air traffic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">00:10:43</a>. Historically, airport stocks were resilient, with air traffic barely decreasing during crises, and companies earning from airfares and, notably, from renting airport space (shops, restaurants) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">00:11:02</a>. A significant factor is that 70% of their income comes from these unregulated, monopolistic rental businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">00:11:17</a>. Aena's shares had multiplied from 50 euros to 200 euros since going public five years prior, but have fallen to around 100 euros due to the current problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">00:11:36</a>. It is currently trading at 10 times its earnings, whereas its historical valuation is around 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">00:11:44</a>. The case of Shanghai Airport, which has barely fallen and still trades at 25 times earnings despite reduced air traffic in China, suggests Western investors may be overreacting with Aena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">00:11:51</a>.

### Autogrill
This Italian company manages restaurants in airports and along highways, being a leader in its sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">00:12:24</a>. Its listing on the Italian stock exchange and direct relation to the airline sector created a "perfect storm," causing shares to fall from ten euros to five euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">00:12:33</a>. Autogrill has low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">00:12:48</a>, and once the transitory situation passes, air traffic and its business will return to growth, with 70% of its income from airport restaurant management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">00:12:52</a>. Historically, Autogrill maintained sales and profits during difficult years like 2008 and 2009, showcasing its business robustness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">00:13:19</a>. Under normal conditions, it could earn one euro per share, and shares should be listed at a minimum of 12 euros, with a future target price expanding to 15 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">00:13:32</a>.

### Amadeus
Another Spanish company, Amadeus, holds a monopoly over the IT infrastructure for flight sales and reservations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">00:14:04</a>. Despite the current lack of popularity for the sector, it is a predictable, high-quality business with low debt under normal market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">00:14:16</a>. Since going public in 2010 at 12 euros per share, its price had risen to 70 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">00:14:25</a>. However, it has fallen vertically to just over 40 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">00:14:34</a>. The current P/E ratio is an attractive 14 times, significantly lower than its normal 20-25 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">00:14:41</a>. Its current value is estimated to be over 80 euros per share, likely expanding above 100 euros in two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">00:14:48</a>.

## Conclusion for Investors
Investors are encouraged to remain calm and not let emotions dictate decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">00:14:58</a>. The stock market has historically survived world wars, hyperinflation, deflation, and multiple financial crises, and this time is expected to be no different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">00:15:03</a>. As JP Morgan famously said, "in bear markets, stocks return to their rightful owners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">00:15:16</a>.

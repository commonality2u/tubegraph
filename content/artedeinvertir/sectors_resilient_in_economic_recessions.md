Understanding how to invest when the economy is weak or facing difficulties is crucial for navigating financial environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This article examines sectors that demonstrate resilience during economic downturns, drawing insights from Federal Reserve reports and market analysis.

## Investing in a Weak Economy
In an environment where an [[investment_strategies_in_an_economic_downturn | economic downturn]] or recession is possible, like the one indicated by the Federal Reserve's forecast of a decrease in GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, it's important to adopt specific [[investment_strategies_for_economic_crises | investment strategies for economic crises]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Key advice for [[investment_strategies_during_economic_downturns | investment strategies during economic downturns]] includes:
*   **Avoid Debt for Investing**: It is generally advisable not to have debt when investing, especially when the market is at its highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   **Maintain Liquidity**: Having some liquidity is beneficial, as recommended by Warren Buffett, alongside debt capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. This liquidity can be used to take advantage of opportunities when assets are cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.
*   **Invest in Quality Companies**: Investing in quality companies with recurring income and low debt is a winning formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. These businesses tend to drop less during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.
*   **Utilize Long-Term Bonds**: Holding long-term bonds, like the TLT ETF (20-year long-term bond ETF), can be a smart strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. If there's no recession, they maintain value and yield returns; if there is a recession, the Federal Reserve will lower rates, causing long-term bond values to rise due to their inverse relationship with interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.
*   **Rotate Portfolio for Opportunities**: Investors should be prepared to rotate their portfolios and seize opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. This involves selling less affected assets to buy those that have fallen significantly, anticipating a recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
*   **Buy When There is Fear**: Historically, the most money is made in the stock market by buying when there is widespread fear and panic, and people are reluctant to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>.

## Resilient Sectors
Certain [[sectorspecific_investment_opportunities | sectorspecific investment opportunities]] typically perform better during recessions. According to a Fidelity analysis, the following sectors tend to be more resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>:

*   **Stable Consumption (Consumer Staples)**: Companies involved in essential goods such as food, drinks, and clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. These cater to basic human needs that people continue to consume regardless of the economic climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. Warren Buffett has been increasing positions in this sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.
*   **Utilities**: Companies providing water and electricity consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. These services are considered essential and stable.
*   **Healthcare**: The health sector is generally not as affected by economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

Sectors like Real Estate and Financials, which rely heavily on debt and consumer confidence, tend to suffer more during recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

## Examples of Resilient Companies
Companies considered "anti-crisis" stocks are characterized by stable business operations and stock market performance during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. They tend to maintain or increase earnings and experience less significant stock drops compared to the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.

### Ahold Delhaize
Ahold Delhaize (Delhaize) is a supermarket company listed in Europe with most of its business in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

*   **Crisis Performance**: During the 2008-2012 financial crisis, while the broader stock market fell by 60%, Delhaize remained relatively flat or experienced minimal drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. It continued to earn money and even grew profits during that difficult period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: As a food distribution company, it benefits from economies of scale, maintaining strong negotiating power with suppliers and offering competitive pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>. It has a significant market share in critical regions, particularly on the East Coast of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>.
*   **Growth and Profitability**: Delhaize has consistently grown sales (4%) and earnings per share (6-9%) through share buybacks and strategic acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. Its private label brands also contribute to higher profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.

### British American Tobacco (BAT)
British American Tobacco (BAT) operates in the stable consumption sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.

*   **Crisis Performance**: During the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, when the broader stock market fell by 60%, BAT only dropped 13% (or 10% including dividends), providing liquidity to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. The company maintained or increased profits during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>.
*   **Business Evolution**: While traditional tobacco volume has decreased, BAT compensates by raising prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>. It is also significantly growing in new categories like vaping and oral tobacco, which are projected to grow by 20% annually until 2030 and have higher profit margins due to lower material costs and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>. These new categories reached breakeven in 2023, signaling a significant future profit contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.
*   **Valuation and Shareholder Value**: BAT is currently trading at historic lows, around 8 times earnings, compared to a historical average of 16-25 times, while offering a high dividend yield of 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. The company plans to generate $50 billion in accumulated free cash flow by 2030, which can be returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. BAT also holds a valuable 20% stake in ITC Limited, a major consumer company in India, which is experiencing high growth and trades at much higher multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>.

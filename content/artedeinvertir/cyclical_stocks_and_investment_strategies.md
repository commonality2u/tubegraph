## Understanding Cyclical Stocks
Cyclical stocks are found in industries such as oil, banking, gas, raw materials, airlines, and carriers. These industries are highly sensitive to the overall [[impact_of_economic_cycles_and_stock_market_valuations | economic cycles]], meaning their performance tends to follow the broader economy's ups and downs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

### Characteristics of Cyclical Stocks
*   **Sensitivity to Economic Cycles**: Their performance is directly tied to the economy. When the economy is strong, these companies thrive; when it weakens, they suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Rapid Price Changes**: Prices of raw materials, which often dictate the profitability of these companies, can change very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Value Generation**: Some cyclical companies, like Mosaic, have shown little to no long-term value generation over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. This contrasts with companies of higher quality that might multiply their value significantly over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

## Investment Strategies for Cyclical Stocks
Investing in cyclical stocks requires a different approach compared to other [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | investment strategies]] or non-cyclical businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

### The Peter Lynch Approach
According to Peter Lynch, a renowned investor, the optimal time to buy cyclical stocks is when their Price-to-Earnings (P/E) valuation is highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. This counterintuitive strategy is based on the idea that a high P/E often occurs when the price of raw materials or the company's cyclicality is at its lowest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. At this stage, results are expected to improve, leading to a rise in the stock market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. Conversely, when the market offers these stocks at a very low valuation multiple, it might indicate that current high raw material prices are unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

### "Renting" vs. "Owning"
Cyclical stocks are often described as good for "renting" (speculating) rather than "owning" (long-term investment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.
*   **Renting/Speculating**: This involves buying for a shorter period, such as one or two years, to capitalize on anticipated improvements in the business cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
*   **Owning/Long-Term Investment**: This is generally not recommended for cyclical stocks due to their inherent volatility and lack of consistent long-term value generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.

### Opportunities During Negativity
The best opportunities to buy cyclical stocks arise when there is significant negativity and the price of the raw material is very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. This often leads to capacity destruction, reducing supply and subsequently increasing prices, resulting in significant stock price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. For example, some cyclical stocks saw important increases from their lows in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

### Example: Gazprom
Gazprom, a Russian gas and oil producer, experienced significant declines in its stock price despite soaring gas and oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. This apparent contradiction highlights the market's anticipation of potential sanctions that could limit its trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Gazprom was trading at a P/E ratio of 2.5 to 2 times earnings with low debt, which would be considered extremely low in most markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Russian Market Context**: The Russian [[stock_market_trends_and_investment_strategies | stock market]] on average trades at about five times earnings, much lower than the 15-16 times average in the US or Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. This is due to the perceived political risks, such as potential expropriations, which investors factor into the stock prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

### Example: Mosaic (Fertilizer Sector)
Mosaic, a company in the fertilizer sector, is another example of a cyclical stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. The price of fertilizers has increased, and companies like Mosaic, not based in Russia, could benefit from global supply disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. However, its historical performance shows long periods of stagnant value, with significant peaks followed by collapses, demonstrating the [[understanding_the_cyclical_nature_of_specific_industries | cyclical nature]] and risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

## Investment Considerations During Market Volatility
During periods of [[investment_strategies_during_economic_volatility | economic volatility]] or market crises, like the Russian-Ukraine conflict, the stock market can experience significant drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Precedent**: Historically, after initial panic, markets often recover relatively quickly from geopolitical conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. For example, the invasion of Iraq in 1990 saw a recovery within 180 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Opportunity**: Such periods can create opportunities for good returns because assets become cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Companies with solid businesses that produce essential goods can maintain profitability even with inflation or rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   **Risk vs. Quality**: The risk of an investment is determined by the quality of the business and the price at which it is offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. General fear in the market can lead to indiscriminate selling, making even high-quality stocks cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Patience and Training**: Investors should be prepared for portfolios to fall significantly (40-50%) and react in an even-tempered manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>. Training in [[strategies_for_stock_market_investment | stock market investment]] can help navigate these periods and identify opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

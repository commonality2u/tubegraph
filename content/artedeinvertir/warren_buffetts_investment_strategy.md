[[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]], often hailed as the greatest investor of all time, manages a portfolio of listed shares valued at over $240 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. After a period of caution and selling due to the ongoing crisis, he has reportedly regained confidence and begun making substantial purchases, including one acquisition exceeding $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## How to Track [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]]'s Investments

Observing the investments of top performers like [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] is considered an excellent way to generate investment ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Nicknamed "the Oracle of Omaha," [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] has grown an initial investment of just $1,000 into immense wealth, consistently generating annual returns over 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The U.S. stock market regulator, the SEC, requires large investors and institutions like [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] (those with over $100 million in investments) to declare their stock purchases, sales, and main holdings quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

There are two primary methods to obtain this information:
1.  **Official Method**: Accessing the SEC's website directly and searching for Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company through which [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] invests. The relevant document is the 13F filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. However, this document can be difficult to understand for new investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
2.  **Simplified Method**: Using websites that process and present this information in a more user-friendly format, such as WayWisdom.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Recent Investment Activities

Using WayWisdom.com, recent sales and purchases by [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]] can be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Sales
[[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]] has primarily reduced his investments in American banks, including Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, and PNC Financial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. These sales suggest a less optimistic outlook on the banking sector for 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Purchases
Recent investments have focused significantly on pharmaceutical companies such as Bristol Myers, Merck, and AbbVie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Additionally, a substantial investment of over $9 billion was made in his own Berkshire Hathaway shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## [[warren_buffetts_investment_principles_for_beginners | Warren Buffett's Investment Principles]]

[[warren_buffetts_investment_principles_for_beginners | Warren Buffett]]'s new investments, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector, exemplify his characteristic investment style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. His strategy involves waiting for good companies with predictable and growing income to trade at an attractive valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This often occurs due to temporary, solvable problems or when the market overlooks these investments in favor of fashionable trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

Historically, pharmaceutical stocks traded at high valuations due to their excellent business models and long-term prospects, driven by an aging population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. However, during the Trump administration (post-2016), the sector faced pressure from threats of new regulations that could reduce profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. With the defeat of Donald Trump and a new democratic administration planning significant investment in healthcare, this threat has dissipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. What remains are robust businesses, resistant to economic crises, with profits that have doubled over the past five years and good growth prospects, now trading at attractive valuations not seen in decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Key Portfolio Holdings for 2021

[[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy_and_market_outlook | Warren Buffett's 2021 portfolio]] primarily consists of six main investments, which account for 80% of his total holdings and are likely to dictate his performance in the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### 1. Apple (AAPL)
*   **Investment**: Over $109 million, representing 47% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Price**: $117 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: Apple is considered one of the best-listed businesses, having multiplied its value by over 100 times in the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] first invested in Apple in 2016 when it was trading at just 8 times earnings, similar to his current pharmaceutical investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. He invested $20 billion at $25 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, generating an $80 trillion profit since then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. While its current valuation is demanding (around 30 times earnings), it is justified by its quality and future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

### 2. Bank of America (BAC)
*   **Investment**: Over $24 billion, representing more than 10% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Price**: $26 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: Bank of America is one of the four major U.S. banks that control an oligopoly in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Post-2008 financial crisis, surviving banks enjoy higher returns on invested capital and profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Despite reducing exposure to other banks, [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]] maintains high conviction in Bank of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. He finds banks attractive, stating they are "good business" if managed properly, yielding 12-16% on tangible book value, superior to a 30-year bond's 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Bank of America shares trade below their historical average at just 12 times earnings, an attractive valuation with good future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

### 3. Coca-Cola (KO)
*   **Investment**: Over $19 billion, representing over 8% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
*   **Price**: $52 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]]'s investment in Coca-Cola mirrors his approach with Apple and pharmaceuticals: investing when a good company faces a temporary, solvable problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. He capitalized on the uncertainty after the "New Coke" fiasco, which led to a decline in sales and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Since his initial investment, Coca-Cola shares have multiplied by over 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. His confidence is so high that he has publicly declared he will never sell a share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Coca-Cola currently trades at 25 times its historical average earnings, a justified valuation for a high-quality business with future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. It's suitable for conservative investors due to low debt and crisis resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

### 4. American Express (AXP)
*   **Investment**: Over $15 billion, representing over 6% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
*   **Price**: $110 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: American Express is another quality business characterized by high profit margins, high return on invested capital, and good growth prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. It operates in an oligopoly alongside Visa and Mastercard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. American Express is currently trading at an attractive valuation, with estimated earnings of over $10 per share for the next 3-5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. Historically, it has traded at over 20 times earnings, suggesting a target price above $200 per share within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This potential appreciation equates to an average annual return of over 15%, which is [[warren_buffetts_investment_principles_for_beginners | Warren Buffett]]'s minimum target return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

### 5. Kraft Heinz (KHC)
*   **Investment**: Over $9 billion, representing over 4% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Price**: $32 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: Kraft Heinz, known for its sauces and food products, is one of the few investments where [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]] has incurred losses, having invested over five years ago at $80 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. He publicly acknowledged paying too high a price based on the company's earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. This illustrates a key lesson: even a good company can be a bad investment if bought at an excessive price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Kraft Heinz also faces challenges such as high debt and declining popularity of its products due to healthier eating trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. However, [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] maintains his position, likely due to the company now trading at a very interesting valuation multiple, specifically below its historical average of 14 times EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. With reduced debt and stabilized revenue, it could return to its historical average, suggesting a target value of $50 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

### 6. Moody's (MCO)
*   **Investment**: Over $7 billion, representing over 3% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.
*   **Price**: $270 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: Moody's represents the ideal investment type for [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]]: a company with a dominant market position, resilience to crises, high profit margins, and predictable earnings growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. It controls the oligopoly of debt rating agencies with Standard & Poor's and Fitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. These companies have the power to raise prices annually due to a lack of competition in an unregulated sector, leading to exceptional stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. Moody's historically trades around 25 times earnings, its current valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. With earnings per share growing over 15% annually in the last five years, it could reach $20 per share by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. Valuing this at 25 times earnings suggests a target price of $500 per share, a 100% return from its current $270 price, equivalent to a 15% average annual compound return, aligning with [[warren_buffetts_investment_principles_for_beginners | Warren Buffett]]'s investment goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

## Remaining Portfolio & Overall Strategy

The six stocks discussed constitute 80% of [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]]'s portfolio, reflecting his strong conviction in these investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. The remaining 20% is more diversified across a larger number of stocks, but they consistently follow the same pattern: quality stocks, resistant to crises, bought at reasonable valuation multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. These include companies such as Amazon, Visa, Mastercard, McDonald's, and DaVita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

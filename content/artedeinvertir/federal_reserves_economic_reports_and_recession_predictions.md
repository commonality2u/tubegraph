The [[role of Federal Reserve and central banks in market movements | Federal Reserve]], as a major monetary authority, publishes documents detailing changes in the economic situation and when a possible recession could begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Understanding these reports and supporting data is crucial for navigating investment decisions in the stock market and other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The information from the United States often impacts the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Federal Reserve's Latest Forecasts

The [[central_bank_forecasts_and_economic_recession | Federal Reserve]] has started to forecast a decrease in GDP, which is commonly referred to as a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This is notable because recessions often arrive when least expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Historically, in 2022, forecasts indicated a 90% chance of recession, but it did not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This is attributed to economic prudence and the avoidance of excesses when everyone prepares for the worst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Conversely, the market currently assigns only a 5% probability of a recession in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, with the consensus expecting economic growth between 1.5% and 3.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The [[federal_reserves_plan_and_economic_recession | Federal Reserve's own report]], using market data and surveys, indicates potential negative GDP growth from -0.1% to -0.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Private vs. Public Sector Growth

According to a recent interview with a former U.S. Minister of Economy, the private sector is currently in recession, even if the overall economy shows growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This phenomenon, also observed in Europe, is due to the public sector driving growth through public spending and investments financed by governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. The private sector, which is essential for sustainable economic health, reports negative growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Public sector growth financed by debt and public deficit is unsustainable long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

The U.S. public deficit is at record levels, nearing $2 trillion, significantly higher than the objective of $1 trillion (around 3% of GDP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Current deficit levels are almost 7-8% of GDP, which is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. There is a clear effort to reduce this deficit, potentially down to $1 trillion, which in the short term may cause [[market_volatility_and_economic_predictions | volatility]] but in the long term, it is a good decision for economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

## Key [[Economic Recession Indicators and Predictions | Economic Recession Indicators and Predictions]]

### GDPNow (Atlanta Federal Reserve)

The Atlanta division of the [[role_of_federal_reserve_and_central_banks_in_market_movements | Federal Reserve]] publishes data from "GDPNow," a real-time estimate of U.S. GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. This data is considered quite reliable and accurate for predicting GDP figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. They are currently forecasting a 1.5% drop in GDP, a significant plummet from previous predictions of 2.5% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

### Inflation (Truflation)

Inflation is finally decreasing, which can be a sign of economic cooling sought by the Fed through high interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. While the U.S. government reports inflation at 3%, private company Truflation, which has proven reliable, indicates inflation levels of only 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. This is well below the Fed's target of 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.

### The Yield Curve

The yield curve is a crucial [[Economic Recession Indicators and Predictions | economic indicator]] that has historically predicted almost all crises, including COVID-19, within 12 to 24 months of inversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

**What it is:** The yield curve measures the profitability of 10-year U.S. government bonds against 3-month bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. Normally, long-term interest rates are higher due to increased risk and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

**Inversion:** An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term interest rates are higher than long-term rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. This happens when [[federal_reserves_impact_on_the_economy | central banks]] raise short-term rates significantly to cool the economy and combat inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. When the yield curve inverts, the cost of mortgages and company financing rises, leading to a lack of long-term credit and an economic slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

**Historical Precedent:** The [[stock_market_and_economic_recession_history | stock market and economic recession history]] shows that a recession typically occurs when the yield curve *disinvites* (stops being inverted and goes from negative to positive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. This is when the Fed realizes it needs to lower short-term interest rates quickly to reactivate the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.

**Current State:** The yield curve has experienced one of its strongest inversions in a long time, reaching -1% by mid-2023, and is now beginning to "disinvest" (normalize) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a>. Advanced GDP data seems to anticipate this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>.

> [!info] Psychological Effect
> The historical reliability of the yield curve creates a psychological effect: when it inverts, people question the economy, which can contribute to the eventual downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.

## Current Economic Challenges

Beyond the yield curve, other factors contribute to economic uncertainty:
*   **Trump's tariffs** are generating significant economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>.
*   **American consumer confidence** has plummeted to 8-month lows due to these policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>.
*   The first fall in consumption in two years has been reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>.
*   The [[federal_reserves_impact_on_the_economy | Federal Reserve]] may have erred by raising interest rates too high, making it difficult to avoid a collision course for the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>. The Fed will likely have to lower rates rapidly at some point, leading to further [[market_volatility_and_economic_predictions | volatility]] and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>.

## Investing in a Weak Economy

### General Advice
*   **Avoid debt for investing:** It is better to have liquidity and debt capacity when the market is at its highest, saving debt for when assets are cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>. Buying cheaper assets reduces risk and increases potential returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>.
*   **Rotate portfolio:** Big investors rotate their portfolios to take advantage of opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>. Panic and fear in the stock market can lead to businesses being quoted at "ridiculous prices," creating opportunities not seen in the real economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:00">[19:36:00]</a>.
*   **Buy during fear and panic:** The most money is made in the stock market when people are afraid and unwilling to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:33:00">[25:33:00]</a>.

### Quality Companies & Long-Term Bonds
*   **Invest in quality companies:** Companies with recurring income and low debt are a winning formula during crises, as they tend to drop less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>. They can provide liquidity to sell and reinvest in other assets that have dropped significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>.
*   **Have liquidity and long-term bonds:** Warren Buffett accumulates liquidity to seize opportunities during market corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:00">[21:54:00]</a>. Similarly, some investors use long-term bonds (like the TLT ETF for 20-year bonds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>.
    *   **Scenario 1 (No Recession):** Bonds maintain value, and you earn current returns (e.g., 4-5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>.
    *   **Scenario 2 (Recession):** The Fed lowers rates, causing the value of long-term bonds to rise (as bonds move inversely to interest rates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a>. This strategy is considered smarter than shorting the market due to the risk of further rallies before a downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40:00">[22:40:00]</a>.

### Sector Performance During Cycles
During a recession, some sectors perform better due to their essential nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:00:00">[28:00:00]</a>.
*   **Strong Sectors:**
    *   **Stable consumption:** Food, drinks, clothing (basic needs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:15:00">[28:15:00]</a>.
    *   **Utilities:** Water and electricity companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:27:00">[28:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Healthcare:** Generally unaffected by economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a>.
*   **Weak Sectors:**
    *   **Real Estate:** People are less likely to buy new homes due to credit difficulties or job insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45:00">[28:45:00]</a>.
    *   **Financial Sector:** Highly dependent on debt, making it vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:55:00">[28:55:00]</a>. Warren Buffett has recently sold many financial companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>.

## Case Studies: Crisis-Resistant Companies

### Ahold Delhaize (Supermarket Sector)
Ahold Delhaize is a supermarket company, primarily operating in the United States (around 55 billion in sales on the East Coast) despite being listed in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:58:00">[32:58:00]</a>. It has a strong competitive position as a market leader or second-largest in most European markets it serves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:24:00">[36:24:00]</a>.

*   **Crisis Resistance:** During the 2008 financial crisis, when the stock market dropped 60%, Ahold Delhaize remained largely sideways, with only minor dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:06:00">[33:06:00]</a>. Its profits even grew during difficult periods, demonstrating stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:00">[38:31:00]</a>.
*   **Business Model:** It benefits from scale in the supermarket sector, which allows for strong negotiating power with suppliers and higher profit margins from its own private-label brands (45% of sales are private label) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:45:00">[36:45:00]</a>.
*   **Growth and Valuation:** Ahold Delhaize aims for 4% sales growth and high single-digit EPS growth (around 8% including share buybacks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:55:00">[40:55:00]</a>. Despite its stronger growth compared to Walmart (which grew at 4%), it trades at a P/E of 12x, while Walmart trades at 38x, highlighting a valuation disparity between European and U.S. markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:58:00">[41:58:00]</a>.

### British American Tobacco (BAT)
British American Tobacco (BAT) operates in the tobacco and new nicotine product sectors, categorized as stable consumption due to regular use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:32:00">[47:32:00]</a>.

*   **Crisis Resistance:** During the 2008-2009 global stock market crisis (60% market drop), BAT only fell by 13% (10% with dividends), providing liquidity to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:51:00">[47:51:00]</a>. The company maintained or increased profits during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:32:00">[48:32:00]</a>.
*   **Business Evolution:** While traditional cigarette volume has decreased, price increases compensate for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:05:00">[51:05:00]</a>. New categories like vaping and oral tobacco (e.g., Velo) are growing rapidly (20% annually until 2030) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:55:00">[52:55:00]</a>. These new products are considered less harmful and face lower taxes, improving profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:04:00">[59:04:00]</a>. These new categories broke even in 2023 and are expected to significantly boost profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:42:00">[55:42:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Strength & Valuation:** BAT aims to generate an accumulated free cash flow of $50 billion by 2030, which is substantial given its current capitalization of $60 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:40:00">[56:40:00]</a>. It offers a high dividend yield of 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:06:00">[57:06:00]</a>. The company is currently trading at historic lows, around 8 times earnings, compared to its historical average of 16-25 times earnings, and Philip Morris (a peer) trading at 16 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:49:00">[59:49:00]</a>.
*   **Hidden Asset:** BAT holds a 20% stake in ITC Limited, a major consumer company in India, which is experiencing high growth and trades at high multiples (25-30 times earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. This stake is valued at around $15 billion, effectively reducing BAT's P/E multiple to around 6.5 times when adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.

> [!tip] Outlook for India
> India is poised to be a major economic engine, similar to China's role over the past 25 years, driven by a growing middle class and consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>.

## Conclusion
While there may be recessions and [[market_volatility_and_economic_predictions | volatility]] in the short term, a long-term bullish perspective is generally necessary to make money in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:18">[01:04:18]</a>. The fundamentals are often stronger than portrayed in media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>. The key to successful investing is to understand economic data, interpret indicators like the yield curve, and primarily focus on avoiding losses, as emphasized by Warren Buffett's rule number one: "not to lose money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:06">[01:33:06]</a>.

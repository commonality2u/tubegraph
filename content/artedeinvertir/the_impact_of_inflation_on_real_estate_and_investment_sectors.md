**[[Inflation and its impact on the economy | Inflation]]** has emerged as a significant factor influencing the investment landscape, with figures currently around 4-5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This rise, driven by increasing prices in sectors like automobiles, energy, and rentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, presents both challenges and [[impact_of_economic_indicators_and_inflation_on_investment_decisions | investment opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Many prominent investors, including Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, and Ray Dalio, have warned that [[inflation_expectations_and_their_impact_on_investments | inflation could persist longer than expected]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Key Investor Perspectives

### Warren Buffett
Warren Buffett has observed "quite significant [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | inflation]]" with rising prices being accepted by consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. He emphasizes that [[impact_of_inflation_on_purchasing_power_and_investments | inflation acts like an "additional tax" on investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, particularly for money held in fixed-term deposits or liquidity, which loses value over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Investing in productive assets, such as stocks, is recommended to counteract this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Charlie Munger
Charlie Munger has warned about the dangers of printing money, quantitative easing, and zero interest rates, even suggesting a risk of ending up like Venezuela if red lines are crossed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Ray Dalio
Ray Dalio highlighted that the Fed cannot tighten economic conditions (e.g., raising interest rates or ending quantitative easing) without a significant negative impact on markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. An example of this was seen in 2018 when rapid interest rate hikes caused a 20% market drop, forcing the Fed to reverse course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Currently, high market valuations and zero interest rates suggest potential volatility if rates rise in 2022 or 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Strategies for Investing in Inflationary Environments
Warren Buffett advises seeking investments that perform well in any economic environment, especially those resembling a "toll bridge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Warren Buffett's "Toll Bridge" Concept
A "toll bridge" company is one that has already made the bulk of its investment capital using "old dollars" and does not require significant continuous reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. These businesses are typically predictable, offer essential products or services with continuous demand, and can raise prices in proportion to [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]], causing their income to rise while costs remain relatively stable, thus skyrocketing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Examples of "Toll Bridge" Investments

#### 1. Moody's (Credit Rating Agency)
Moody's provides debt ratings, a service essential regardless of [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Its brand image and reputation are already established, requiring minimal ongoing investment to maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. This allows Moody's to raise prices at or above the rate of [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] without proportional increases in capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. From 2015 to an estimated 2022, operating cash flow has grown from $1 billion to $2.5 billion, while capital investment has only slightly increased from $74 million to $94 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. This leads to disproportionate profit growth and strong stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. The value proposition is clear: Moody's rating can save companies significant interest payments on bonds, making its fee a small price to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

#### 2. Franco Nevada (Gold Royalty Company)
The gold sector, including gold futures, physical gold, and gold mining companies, tends to perform well during periods of [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. However, pure mining companies can be volatile if [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | inflation]] doesn't materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. Gold royalty companies like Franco Nevada finance gold mining projects and receive a percentage of future gold production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. They have already made their investment in mines in the past ("old dollars") and are not subject to rising costs of new investments due to [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. Their revenue increases as gold prices rise, while their costs remain stable, leading to soaring profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. Franco Nevada has significantly outperformed NASDAQ, S&P 500, gold itself, and gold mining companies since its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

#### 3. MTN (Fast Food Franchises)
MTN owns royalties and rights to fast-food franchises, which have proven resilient during crises and high [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | inflation]] periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. When restaurants raise menu prices due to [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]], MTN's revenue automatically increases because its income is based on a percentage of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>. Meanwhile, MTN's own costs, primarily central staff and support for franchisees, do not increase proportionally, leading to skyrocketing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. The company can support 50% more sales with the same central staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

#### 4. Residential REIT (Real Estate Investment Trusts)
Real estate, particularly residential REITs, is another sector that performs well during [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. These companies have already invested in buildings ("old dollars") and do not need to build from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. Rental contracts often include clauses for price increases linked to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. This allows them to increase income without significantly increasing investment levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. Residential REITs benefit from appreciating property values and maintaining fixed-rate debt during [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. An example is a REIT with properties in favorable US states like Texas, Tennessee, Florida, Nevada, and Arizona, which have seen significant appreciation and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. This specific company is able to raise rents for renewals by 6% (higher than US [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]]) and new rentals by 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.

#### 5. Financial Companies
Financial companies are another sector that historically performs well during [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:07">[01:24:07]</a>. Their core investment is giving loans, which were made with "old dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. As interest rates tend to rise with [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]], banks and financial companies see their income increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. Examples mentioned include *Navarro* (a financial company giving car loans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>.

### Less Recommended Options

#### Inflation-Protected Bonds (TIPs)
While designed to protect against [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | inflation]], bonds like TIPs (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) are generally not recommended for private investors aiming to grow assets significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. Their historical annual performance (e.g., 1-2% over 15 years plus a 3% coupon) is considered very low and "depressing" for wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.

## Other Companies and Sectors Discussed

*   **Hamilton Son (Fertility Technologies):** Operates in the growing fertility technology market, where it acquires smaller companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. The market is lucrative and largely unregulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>. While smaller and less liquid, it has shown significant growth (20x since 2013, 30% annual growth rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>.
*   **Stone Company (Payment Solutions in Brazil):** Warren Buffett has invested in this company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>. It provides payment terminals and financing lines to small businesses in Brazil, competing with traditional banks by offering lower commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>. It has grown significantly but had a very high valuation in early 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>. It carries currency risk due to billing in Brazilian reals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.
*   **Keystone Law (Law Firm):** A UK-based law firm that has shown strong organic growth and growth through acquisitions of other firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>. Legal services are recurrent and do not suffer significantly during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>. It requires little capital investment to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.
*   **H&R Block / Book Group (Tax Filing/Accounting Services):** Companies like H&R Block offer tax filing services and accounting consultancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>. This is a super predictable business as all companies are legally required to do their accounting annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:08">[01:17:08]</a>. They grow by acquiring accounting/tax advisors, sharing profits with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.
*   **Boxlight Corporation (Interactive Classroom Technology):** Develops and sells interactive services and equipment for classrooms, such as interactive whiteboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>. The company has experienced spectacular revenue growth, partly aided by the confinement period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:21">[01:26:21]</a>.
*   **Lemonade (Insurance Technology):** The speaker expresses caution about this company due to difficulty in establishing a competitive advantage in the insurance sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. The core of insurance is accurately estimating claims, not distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>, and Lemonade often shows losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:25">[01:19:25]</a>. Its valuation is also considered high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:27">[01:20:27]</a>.

## General Investment Principles
Regardless of market conditions, it is crucial to:
*   Be sensitive to valuation and avoid buying at any price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.
*   Invest in good businesses that can withstand various economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>.
*   Understand how [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] can affect your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.
*   Recognize that volatility is normal in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.
*   Continuously train and learn about investing, as it is not "easy money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:33">[01:08:33]</a>.
*   Concentrate portfolios, ideally with 8-15 companies, to take advantage of opportunities in small companies with high growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a>.
*   Understand and monitor investments rather than blindly copying ideas from funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>.

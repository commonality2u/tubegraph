Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of all time, emphasizes several key techniques for successful stock market [[Investment strategies and advice|investing]], particularly when starting with little capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A core aspect of his [[Investment strategies and advice|investment strategy]] revolves around patience and the power of compound interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## The Power of Compounding
Warren Buffett explains that investing in good businesses capable of generating high returns for many years allows investors to benefit from the effect of compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Doing the research once on a quality stock can yield benefits for 10, 15, or 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Conversely, buying a poor-quality stock because it's cheap (e.g., rising 20-30%) requires immediate selling, preventing [[longterm_investment_strategies|long-term value generation]] and the benefit of compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

### Examples of Compounding
*   **American Express:** A stock in Buffett's portfolio for decades, it historically shows a return of 1200%, multiplying its value by 13 since 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. This is due to its competitive advantage as one of three major credit card companies, allowing it to control prices and prosper even with [[navigating_inflation_and_interest_rate_hikes_in_investing|inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
*   **Google:** Charlie Munger considers Google to have the greatest competitive advantage globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. Since going public, it has multiplied by almost 50 times in 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.
*   **Disney:** Disney's iconic franchises and ability to raise prices (e.g., park entry fees increasing from $3.50 in 1971 to over $160 today) have led to its stock multiplying by over 100 times in the last 30-40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.
*   **Wells Fargo:** Warren Buffett invested in Wells Fargo in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:41:00">[32:41:00]</a>. Despite periods of sideways movement (e.g., 1993-1996), the stock multiplied by 10 times in 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:55:00">[32:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:56:00">[33:56:00]</a>.
*   **Apple:** Buffett's investment in Apple in 2016, during a period of stagnated sales and concerns, has multiplied by six times, becoming one of his best investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Patience
Warren Buffett famously states that "the stock market is a mechanism to transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This highlights the crucial role of [[patience_and_decisionmaking_in_investing|patience and decision-making in investing]].

### Seizing Opportunities in Crises
Patient investors capitalize on market panics or specific company problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **March 2020 (COVID-19):** When the stock market plummeted due to panic, valuations became "ridiculous" even for non-cyclical stocks. Patient investors recognized that solutions would be found and the market would eventually reflect true value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Volkswagen "Dieselgate" (2015):** Volkswagen's stock fell drastically from €250 to €80 due to the scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. While it recovered to €250, it took three years, requiring [[patience_and_decisionmaking_in_investing|patience]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Bank of America (Financial Crisis):** Warren Buffett invested over $5 billion in Bank of America at $5 per share during the 2009-2011 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. He understood that central banks would rescue banks. He had to wait until 2018 for the stock to return to $30, multiplying his investment by six times over almost eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

### Advice for Cultivating Patience
*   **Do not be in a hurry to sell:** Charlie Munger, Buffett's partner, states that "real money... is not found in the constant buying and selling but in waiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:53:00">[31:53:00]</a>. Successful investors become rich by finding investments that multiply many times and waiting patiently for them to generate value [[longterm_investment_strategies|over the long term]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:20:00">[32:20:00]</a>.
*   **Understand the business:** Deeply [[understanding_and_investing_in_compounders_and_undervalued_companies|understanding a business's fundamentals]] and its ability to generate future profits provides the certainty needed to remain patient during market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:37:00">[37:37:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on fundamentals, not price:** The stock market's short-term movements can be capricious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:10:00">[36:10:00]</a>. Your guide should be the business's fundamentals (earnings per share, book value), not merely the stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:39:00">[38:39:00]</a>. Warren Buffett says the stock market is "there to serve you, not to instruct you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>.
*   **Resist greed and envy:** Do not be swayed by others getting rich quickly in "hot" or fashionable sectors, as this often leads to poor outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:42:00">[40:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:07:00">[41:07:00]</a>. The dot-com bubble of 2000 showed how market euphoria can lead to significant corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>. Staying disciplined and adhering to a defined [[longterm_investment_philosophy|investment philosophy]] is key to [[Investment Strategies of Successful Investors|long-term success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:51:00">[29:51:00]</a>.
*   **Accept volatility:** Even successful investments like Apple have experienced multiple corrections of over 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:43:00">[34:43:00]</a>. Volatility is normal, and [[patience_and_decisionmaking_in_investing|patience]] allows investors to ride out these periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:24:00">[39:24:00]</a>.

## Investing in Yourself
The best investment you can make is in yourself, as the more you learn, the more you will earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:56:00">[53:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:01:00">[54:01:00]</a>. This knowledge provides the basis for sound [[methods_for_effective_saving_and_investment|investment decisions]], fosters [[patience_and_decisionmaking_in_investing|patience]], and enables individuals to navigate the complexities of the market effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:04:00">[54:04:00]</a>.

[[Ray Dalio]] recently divested completely from his Chinese stock holdings, eliminating all exposure to Chinese companies in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This significant move reflects his increasingly negative macroeconomic outlook on China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Specific Sales
According to an article from Barron's and public portfolio data from sources like Data Roma and Whale Wisdom, [[Ray Dalio]] sold:
*   Alibaba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>
*   JD.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>
*   DiDi Global (DIDI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>

As a result, his portfolio no longer holds any popular Chinese companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Reasons for Divestment
The decision appears to be driven by a worsening situation in China, particularly concerns about the real estate bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### Broader Economic Concerns for Emerging Countries
When a negative macroeconomic outlook is predicted, emerging countries typically face more severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This is because their economies are often:
*   More cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>
*   Less developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>
*   Less stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>
*   Have a smaller service component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>
*   Tend to be more industrial, focusing on primary sectors and raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>

These characteristics make emerging markets more susceptible to economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. The speaker suggests that these divestments indicate a more cautious approach from investors like [[Ray Dalio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, sending a message about what they are selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

## Shift Towards Stability
Conversely, investors like [[Ray Dalio]] have been observed to purchase equity shares from the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. These are theoretically more stable in complex macroeconomic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

This shift suggests that while investors might not "sell everything automatically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, they do rotate their portfolios towards safer assets if a crisis is foreseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, opting for companies that can perform reasonably well even during economic difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

Recent weeks have seen significant market focus on inflation, with new data and information emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Experts like Ray Dalio and Michael Burry warn that inflation is worsening and could lead to a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Understanding Current Inflation
Current inflation can be categorized into transitory and persistent components. A Bank of America study indicates that "transitory" inflation has recently surged, similar to the rebound seen after the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. However, many believe the current situation could lead to more persistent inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

A key factor contributing to extended inflation is the global chip shortage, which Intel announced on October 21st, 2021, will likely last until 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This shortage has impacted manufacturers like Toyota and Renault, leading to reduced production chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Building a new microchip factory typically takes 18 to 24 months, meaning factories started in late 2020/early 2021 won't be fully operational until late 2022 or early 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This extends the expected normalization of semiconductor effects on inflation from mid-2022 to potentially the end of next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Social Impact of Inflation
Ray Dalio has warned that inflation, coupled with interest rate increases, can exacerbate social inequality by reducing disposable income for the poorest classes while benefiting those with financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This can lead to populist political movements and longer-lasting crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Market Concerns and Indicators
Beyond inflation, there are concerns about high stock market valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Stock Market Bubbles
Some experts, including Cathie Wood, suggest the market is not far from a bubble, especially in certain segments where valuations and expectations are very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

The S&P 500 shows a high correlation with the balance sheets of central banks, indicating that quantitative easing programs have pushed valuations up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Ray Dalio highlights that central bank balance sheets have quadrupled since 2009, mirroring the S&P 500's rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. If central banks cease injecting money, as seen between 2014 and 2016, the S&P 500 could enter a more modest or sideways period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This is seen as a potentially greater risk than inflation due to its powerful market effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Negative Real Returns
A key indicator of a potential stock market bubble before a correction is negative real returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. For example, if the S&P 500 offers a 5% implicit profitability, but inflation is 5.5%, the real profitability is negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Historically, negative real profitability has preceded difficult periods in the stock market, such as the 1970s crisis, the 1982 drop, and the dot-com bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Chinese Market Risk
Cathie Wood has also warned about a severe drop in Chinese assets or the Chinese economy, which could impact the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. She has recently divested almost all of her Chinese stock holdings due to this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

### Market Liquidity and Investor Sentiment
Looking at market liquidity is another interesting indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. High cash levels in American investment funds (exceeding 5% average liquidity) historically precede market increases, as investors eventually need to reinvest their capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. This indicates caution is returning to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

### S&P 500 Valuation Distortion
While the S&P 500 may seem expensive, a study by Borja suggests that if the top 10 stocks (which trade at an average of 60 times earnings and have high weight) are removed, the rest of the S&P 500 trades around 16 times earnings, which is its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. Companies like Apple and Microsoft, despite high valuations, are often justified by greater growth expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

### Seasonality
Historically, summer months (May to October) tend to show more discreet market behavior, while the last months of the year often see a rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. This psychological trend is linked to investors valuing shares based on next year's earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

## [[Investment Strategies During Inflationary Cycles | Investment Strategies During Inflationary Cycles]]: Counter-Consensus Investing
It is important to be cautious of market consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. When analysts frequently mention inflation, it often means the risk is already incorporated into prices, and crises typically arise from unforeseen issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. Warren Buffett noted that the next crisis is often for a different reason than the one everyone is focused on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.

Bank of America's monthly surveys show herd behavior: during inflationary periods, energy, banks, and commodities are favored, while technology and healthcare are least popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. In the short to medium term, this survey often behaves in the opposite way, suggesting that when a sector is overly popular, it may be time to look at less favored but undervalued sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

### Companies with Potential in Current Environment

The following companies are discussed as potential [[investment opportunities during inflation | investment opportunities during inflation]] or good long-term holdings:

*   **Google (Alphabet)**
    *   **Performance:** Spectacular results with earnings per share almost doubling year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. YouTube is growing significantly (around 40%), and overall company growth exceeds 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
    *   **Cloud Business:** Google Cloud's losses are minimizing, indicating future profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. As a high-fixed-cost business, increased revenue in cloud services can significantly boost profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.
    *   **Share Buybacks:** Google has accelerated share buybacks, even at historical highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. As a business that doesn't require substantial capital to grow, excess cash can be used for buybacks, boosting earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.
    *   **Future Potential:** Profits could grow 25-30% even with 20% revenue growth due to margin expansion and buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. Analysts estimate potential earnings of $150 next year and close to $300 by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.
    *   **Android Monetization:** Android, while not yet monetized, presents a massive future revenue stream, potentially adding $5-10 billion in profits annually by charging manufacturers for installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.
*   **Facebook (Meta)**
    *   **Performance:** Despite a recent drop, Facebook grew revenue by 33% and total revenue by 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>. Operating profit grew around 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
    *   **Expense Management:** The company expects significant investment in 2022 for technical, product, and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>, which may pressure margins short-term but indicates long-term growth foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>.
    *   **Share Buybacks:** Facebook significantly accelerated buybacks, going from $1 billion last year to $13 billion, and announced a new $50 billion buyback program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. This signals management confidence and will boost EPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>.
    *   **Long-Term Value:** Despite short-term controversies (e.g., privacy policy changes), Facebook's platform with many users ensures advertisers will continue to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. It is estimated to earn $30 per share by 2025, potentially valuing it around $750 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.
*   **Microsoft**
    *   **Performance:** Revenue grew 11%, but operating profit increased by 42% and EPS by 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
    *   **Cloud (Azure):** The cloud segment is a significant driver, growing at 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. Incremental revenue flows directly to profit due to high fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>.
    *   **Pricing Power:** Microsoft is implementing a 20% price increase for Office products starting March 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>. This pricing power, with low alternative options for customers, will significantly boost future profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.
    *   **Future Potential:** Expected to earn $12 or more next year, leading to target prices of $400-$450 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. Profits are projected to grow 20-25% annually, potentially doubling the price by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.
*   **Visa / Mastercard**
    *   **Business Model:** Highly predictable oligopoly business with no direct alternatives for payment processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>.
    *   **Growth Levers:** Global shift from cash to electronic payments (volume growth of 7-8%) and continuous price increases (5% annually) drive 10-12% revenue growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>.
    *   **Profitability:** Similar to Google and Microsoft, they require minimal capital reinvestment, allowing for significant share buybacks that accelerate EPS growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. EPS is expected to grow 15-20% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>.
    *   **Valuation:** Even with conservative estimates, Visa could reach $420 valuation in five years, offering double-digit returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. High-quality companies like Visa are generally good [[safe investments during high inflation periods | safe investments during high inflation periods]] when they dip 20-30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
*   **DaVita**
    *   **Recent Performance:** Stock fell due to a slight downward adjustment in profit forecasts, causing market panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.
    *   **Valuation:** Trades cheaply at 11-12 times earnings, significantly below its historical average of 18 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>. The company's profits have consistently grown (from $3 in 2017 to $9 currently) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:58">[01:04:58]</a>.
    *   **Debt:** A higher debt leverage ratio (greater than three times) makes the stock more volatile to negative news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. However, it can buy back shares with its profits when cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.
*   **Betterware (Mexico)**
    *   **Business Model:** Direct marketing systems for home products, benefiting from confinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>.
    *   **Recent Performance:** Experienced flat returns lately due to difficult comparable bases from prior explosive growth (130% last year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:47">[01:06:47]</a>.
    *   **Valuation:** Currently trades at approximately 8 times earnings, despite continued growth forecasts (57% this year, 17% next year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>. It could trade at 15 times earnings, implying a significant upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>.
    *   **Risk Management:** Portfolio risk management is crucial with such stocks. As the stock appreciated, exposure was reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>.
*   **Constellation Software (CSL)**
    *   **Business Model:** A holding company that buys industrial or service businesses at attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>.
    *   **Growth:** Forecast to grow 70% this year and 180% next year, with analysts often underestimating its future growth through acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:17">[01:51:17]</a>.
    *   **Risk Mitigation:** Diversification within the holding company structure mitigates the risk of individual business failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:53">[01:50:53]</a>.
    *   **Financials:** Trades at a reasonable multiple for a growing business, has no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>.
*   **Argan / VGP (Logistics REITs)**
    *   **Sector Growth:** The logistics real estate sector is growing significantly due to e-commerce expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>.
    *   **Business Model:** Develop and rent logistics and semi-industrial properties. They build new centers and achieve high occupancy rates (99%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>.
    *   **Financials:** VGP shows strong growth in income and rents. The debt level for VGP is conservative at 30% of net value (or 50% using equity-based calculation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17">[01:23:17]</a>. These companies benefit from fixed-rate debt during inflation, as asset values skyrocket while debt remains constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:21">[01:24:21]</a>.
    *   **Long-term Performance:** Both companies have shown consistent value generation over the long term, with Argan multiplying 10-fold in 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a>.
*   **Vitec (Swedish Holding Company)**
    *   **Investment History:** Identified as a profitable small cap, multiplying 10 times in two years since 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:35">[01:32:35]</a>.
    *   **Growth:** Revenue grew from 1 billion to 3 billion crowns in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:30">[01:33:30]</a>. Earnings are estimated to continue growing at 20% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:11">[01:35:11]</a>.
    *   **Valuation:** Currently trades at a high valuation (40-35 times earnings) due to recognized quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:42">[01:34:42]</a>.

### Less Favorable Companies
*   **Intel:** Faced competitive threats from AMD and NVIDIA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>. Recent results show compressed margins in a high-demand environment, indicating competitive pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>. Expected to trade at a lower multiple (12-13 times earnings) due to competitive position issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
*   **Canadian Solar (CSIQ):** In the overheated renewable energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:52">[01:39:52]</a>. Margins have compressed, and it's not a hyper-growth company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:57">[01:40:57]</a>. Manufacturing components for solar panels is a highly competitive segment often hurt by cheap labor and lack of intellectual property protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:31">[01:41:31]</a>.

## Key Investment Principles during Economic Instability
*   **Long-Term Focus:** Don't overreact to single-quarter results; a long-term perspective is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a>.
*   **Understand Business Quality:** Focus on companies with "pricing power" that can raise prices without losing customers, like Microsoft and Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>. These companies generate high profits even with modest revenue growth because costs remain stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.
*   **Operating Leverage:** Companies with high operating leverage can see profits skyrocket as revenue increases because fixed costs are already covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.
*   **Share Buybacks:** Accelerating share buybacks indicates management's confidence in the company's future and boosts EPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.
*   **Flexibility:** Investors must be flexible and willing to change their views on companies as competitive landscapes evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Management:** Manage portfolio risk by adjusting position sizes based on valuation and risk. Cheaper shares generally carry less risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>.
*   **Identify Undervaluation:** Look for companies trading at historical valuation lows, especially those with consistent profit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>.
*   **Niche Markets:** Explore lucrative niche markets like Nordic small-cap holding companies, which have shown significant long-term returns and strong ethical business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:40">[01:35:40]</a>. These companies often have strong founder alignment and low fraud risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:03">[01:38:03]</a>.
*   **Avoid Overheated Sectors:** Be cautious of sectors where "people are quite excited" and emotions run high, as this can lead to bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:57">[01:39:57]</a>.

In summary, successful [[strategies to protect and grow capital in inflationary environments | strategies to protect and grow capital in inflationary environments]] involve a long-term outlook, a focus on high-quality businesses with pricing power and strong operating leverage, careful portfolio management, and a willingness to explore less-followed but fundamentally sound investment opportunities.

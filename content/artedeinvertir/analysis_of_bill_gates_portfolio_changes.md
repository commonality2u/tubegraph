[[Bill Gates investment strategies and decisions | Bill Gates]], one of the world's wealthiest individuals, has recently undertaken significant changes to his investment portfolio and issued warnings about a new global threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. He has begun rapidly selling off shares, signaling a concern that a looming risk could be more severe than recent crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Investment Acumen and Background

[[Bill Gates investment portfolio | Bill Gates]] has a history of prescient predictions, having warned in 2019 of a crisis similar to one recently experienced, which was initially disregarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He also accurately predicted the resolution of that crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. His investment eye has been demonstrated through early investments in companies like Novavax and BioNTech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, and his prediction that Pfizer, with BioNTech, would be the first to develop a solution to a global problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

While known for founding Microsoft, shares in the company currently represent only 2% of his total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. He has largely diversified his wealth into other sectors and publicly traded shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. His significant success in investments is attributed to his deep understanding of economic and technological sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, making his financial moves closely observed globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## [[Bill Gates portfolio changes and strategies | Recent Portfolio Actions]]

At a recent security conference in Munich, [[Bill Gates]] stated, "it is certain that we will have another pandemic in the future, only this time it will be with a different pathogen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. He has since acted decisively in response to these identified risks for his investments and the broader economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Due to U.S. stock market transparency rules, investors with over $100 million must disclose their investment activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Recent reports show that [[Bill Gates]] has sold 12 of his 18 portfolio shares and has not acquired any new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### [[Reasons behind Bill Gates selling his shares | Reasons for the Sell-Off]]

In a CNBC interview, [[Bill Gates]] provided additional context for his accelerated share sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>:
*   "It may be that we have not yet seen the worst of this crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Expressed concern about public distrust in governments, stating that in a future crisis, action would need to be taken in less than six months, requiring governmental trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   Believes social networks need regulation due to their contribution to societal and economic division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

These statements explain why he has divested from most of his technology shares despite his expertise in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Companies Sold

[[Analysis of Bill Gates favorite stocks in biotechnology | Bill Gates']] capital movements reveal three key factors in his selling strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>:

1.  **Cyclical Companies and High Fixed Costs:** He focused sales on cyclical companies or those with high fixed costs, such as Caterpillar and John Deere shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. These stocks are highly sensitive to economic cycles and tend to fall sharply when economic problems arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

2.  **Technology Companies:**
    *   He sold all his Google shares, one of the few remaining technology holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Following this announcement, Google shares plummeted over 25% in less than 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
    *   Microsoft is the only technology company he retains, accounting for barely 2% of his total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This reduction in technology exposure has proven wise, as the Nasdaq technology index fell over 30% in the first five months of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
    *   Last year, he also sold all his Alibaba shares at $225 per share, just before they dropped to under $90 a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This move helped preserve capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

3.  **Transportation Sector:** He divested from transportation sector shares (UPS and FedEx) and Canadian Pacific Railway, which had performed excellently after his initial low-level investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Betting Against Tesla

[[Bill Gates]] has also started to bet against Tesla shares, a company founded by Elon Musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Despite being a proponent of climate change initiatives and renewable energy, [[Bill Gates]] has shown a dislike for Tesla shares and its founder, even driving a Porsche Taycan, a competitor to Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

Tesla shares (TSLA) have recently plummeted over 50%, demonstrating [[Bill Gates']] foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. One possible reason for this decision is the high valuation Tesla shares reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. [[Bill Gates]] learned firsthand during the 2000 tech bubble that a good company does not always equate to a good investment, as Microsoft shares plummeted 50% and took over 12 years to recover due to high valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Currently, Tesla trades at over 50 times earnings, significantly higher than the market average of 16 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Stocks Retained: A Defensive Strategy

Despite his concerns, [[Bill Gates]] remains invested, understanding that being entirely liquid would erode purchasing power due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The few stocks he has kept are from predictable and defensive sectors, less affected by economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. He has excluded technology companies, which are performing poorly in the current environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Ecolab

Ecolab (ECL) is a simple, understandable business with a strong competitive advantage in water treatment, sanitation, and disinfection products and services, primarily for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Its reputation-based competition makes it resilient against new market entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Ecolab has multiplied by over 20 times on the stock market over the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The company has consistently increased its earnings per share at over 10% rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. It performed well during crises in 2008, 2011, and 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Despite a recent fall of over 30% in its shares, this is comparable to its 40% drop during the more severe 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The company anticipates higher growth rates (over 15% annually) due to new water treatment and environmental regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Its current valuation of 29 times earnings for the next 12 months compares favorably to its five-year average of 33 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

### Waste Management

Waste Management (WM) is the leading garbage collection company in the United States, operating in a predictable, traditional, and crisis-resistant sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This investment aligns with [[Bill Gates']] negative outlook for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. The trend towards waste recycling and environmental respect is expected to benefit the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The waste recycling market is projected to grow well above GDP, at 9% in the coming years, especially in North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Waste Management has multiplied by over 60 times on the stock market due to its high competitive advantage, making it difficult for competitors to enter regions it controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Its shares have remained resilient during recent market declines, another success for [[Bill Gates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Waste Management shares currently trade at their historical average valuation of around 26 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### Other Retained Businesses

[[Bill Gates]] also decided to keep shares in Canadian Pacific Railway (despite an earlier mention of selling transportation shares, the context here seems to refer to a *different* Canadian Pacific company or a retention of some form) and Coca-Cola FEMSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Coca-Cola FEMSA, as the national bottler for Mexico, is considered another very defensive and predictable business, aligning with his conservative investment stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

## The "New Threat"

[[Bill Gates]] has warned of a "new threat" that could severely impact the world and global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. In an interview with Jeremy Hunt, he expressed significant concern about terrorist attacks involving smallpox strains that could be massively spread in public places like airports, stadiums, or shopping centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. He has urged governments to establish a common fund of over $1 billion annually for the control and monitoring of this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## Other Non-Stock Investments

Outside of the stock market, [[Bill Gates]] has been massively accumulating farmland, becoming the largest landowner in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. This move proved very successful just before the recent rise in food prices and global inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

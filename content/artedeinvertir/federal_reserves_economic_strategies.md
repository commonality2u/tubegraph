The latest inflation data has been "terrible" and appears to be "out of control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has even admitted to this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Some central bankers have warned that they have limited tools to address the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Current Economic Situation

Inflation exceeded 9.1%, significantly worse than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Forecasts suggest an increase of up to 100 basis points at the next Fed meeting, with a 40% probability for such a historic hike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. A 75 basis point increase is already largely discounted, aiming for a Fed interest rate of approximately 2.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This aggressive action could lead to market falls, similar to those seen previously when such measures were taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The Central Bank of Canada recently raised rates by 100 basis points, an action the Fed might replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

An additional concern is the [[investment_strategies_for_economic_crises | inversion of the yield curve]], which historically precedes recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Recessions reduce corporate profits, impacting the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This inversion is common during periods of interest rate hikes by central banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Corporate operating margins for S&P 500 companies have begun to correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The stock market is quoted based on corporate profits, and a compression of multiples has already occurred, with a potential second phase of profit compression due to economic recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. China is already experiencing this, and US leading indicators suggest a similar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Rising interest rates also reduce profits for indebted companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

A Goldman Sachs table illustrates significant profit contraction across most sectors, with only the energy sector showing impressive growth (1220%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Financial companies, utilities, and discretionary consumption are reducing profits, while technology's growth has slowed, necessitating valuation adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Limitations of the Federal Reserve's Influence

According to Vicens Hong, a highly reputable investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, inflation could rise further, and the Fed and other central banks have limited tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. He argues that raising interest rates is like trying to remove snow from hell with a spoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. The core problem is a supply issue, as companies are not producing enough due to past COVID-related disruptions and problems with production capacity and personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The Fed cannot force oil companies to extract more oil or gas to reduce energy prices, a main driver of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Governments, rather than central banks, need to act to incentivize investments in the energy sector to lower prices, but they remain "inactive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, admitted that "80% of inflation is out of our control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. While the Fed can control demand by raising interest rates, which discourages consumption, the current issue is on the supply side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a>. Raising the cost of money for companies discourages investment in productive capacity, creating a vicious circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>. Central bankers are in an "uncomfortable place" and must "recognize this reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Investment Implications

Many investors, including [[Investment strategies during economic recessions | Ray Dalio]] and Jim Rogers, predict that the Fed will have to reverse its rate hikes due to the imminent recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>. The expectation is that the market will rebound when the Fed backs down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a>. This backing down will also be influenced by the need to support the US Treasury, as rising interest payments on government debt would divert funds from other essential areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:43">[01:12:43]</a>. Pressure to avoid harming the American treasury should prevent excessive rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>.

In a scenario where inflation remains high but interest rates stay low (due to the Fed backing down), financial assets and real assets (excluding fixed income and liquidity) tend to perform well historically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>. Vicens Hong suggests that in such a scenario, holding gold would be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>. Gold's correlation with real rates of return (10-year bond yield minus inflation) shows it performs well when real yields turn negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>.

The "core CPI," which excludes energy and food prices, has shown some moderation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>. The Fed uses this metric to set interest rates, as it doesn't control food or energy prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. Energy prices, a major driver of inflation, have dropped by 25% in recent weeks, which could help normalize inflation data in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>. Supply chain issues in the goods sector have shifted from a lack of capacity to oversupply, as seen with microchips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>. The market for 10-year protected TIPS bonds discounts inflation for the next ten years to be around the historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21">[01:22:21]</a>.

Warren Buffett and other investors advise looking for stocks with strong market positions, high profit margins, low debt, and the ability to raise prices, as well as non-cyclical businesses that perform well in any economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>. Companies that require little reinvestment and generate substantial cash flow are also favored in inflationary environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>.

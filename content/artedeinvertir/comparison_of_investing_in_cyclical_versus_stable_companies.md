Investing in the stock market involves navigating various types of companies, each with distinct characteristics and behaviors, particularly during different economic cycles. Investors often categorize companies into "cyclical" and "stable" (or defensive) based on how their performance correlates with the overall economy.

## Understanding Cyclical Companies

Cyclical companies are those whose revenues and profits are highly sensitive to the economic cycle, often performing well during economic expansions and poorly during recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Key characteristics and examples include:
*   **Sensitivity to Economic Conditions** Cyclical businesses, especially those in emerging countries, tend to be more volatile and less stable due to their reliance on industrial and primary sectors (raw materials), making them more affected by economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **High Fixed Costs** Industries with significant fixed costs, such as chemical plants or auto manufacturing, can see profits drop substantially during a crisis because these costs cannot be easily reduced despite decreased demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. General Motors, for instance, went bankrupt in the 2008 crisis partly due to its high fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.
*   **Volatility in Earnings and Stock Price** Companies like Micron (semiconductors/chips) exemplify this, with EBIT margins fluctuating from near zero to almost 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>, leading to a "carousel" effect in their stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:59">[00:51:59]</a>. Periods of high demand can lead to peak profits, but subsequent oversupply can cause collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>.
*   **Valuation Multiples** While they can be bought at very low multiples (e.g., 6-7 times earnings) when out of favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, these companies require a different investment approach due to their inherent volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.

## Understanding Stable (Defensive) Companies

Stable companies, often called defensive stocks, exhibit more consistent performance regardless of economic fluctuations due to their essential nature or resilient business models.

Key characteristics and examples include:
*   **Crisis Resistance** Sectors like healthcare, particularly health insurance plans and pharmacies, are highly resistant to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Predictable Growth and Low Debt** Companies like CVS Health offer moderate but stable sales growth (5-7%) and typically carry little debt, which is advantageous during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Attractive Valuations** Despite their stability, these companies can sometimes trade at lower multiples than the market average (e.g., CVS at 12 times earnings versus the S&P 500 at 17-18 times earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   **Shareholder Returns** Many stable companies prioritize returning money to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, which can significantly boost earnings per share over time, even with moderate revenue growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Celanese, a specialized chemical company, is an example, which has multiplied its earnings per share through aggressive buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
*   **Cash Flow Generation in Crises** Some stable businesses, such as certain transportation companies like TFI International, are structured to generate more cash flow during crises by freeing up working capital, providing a buffer against debt problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.
*   **Counter-Cyclical Potential** Rarely, some companies can even increase profits during a crisis, becoming "counter-cyclical." Credit Acceptance, which provides sub-prime auto loans, has demonstrated this ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>. Similarly, S&U PLC, a UK financial services company, is managed conservatively with low debt, allowing it to grow and gain market share when competitors struggle during economic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:43">[01:12:43]</a>.

## Investment Approaches by Famous Investors

Different prominent investors demonstrate varying preferences and strategies regarding cyclical vs. stable companies:
*   **Michael Burry** sold almost all his shares, leaving only a small position in GEO Group, a REIT with private prisons, noting its restructuring and changing regulatory sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. His extreme move suggests a highly bearish outlook, anticipating significant market downturns, similar to the 2000-2001 crisis after an asset bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Ray Dalio** sold all his Chinese stocks, including Alibaba and JD.com, reflecting a negative macro outlook on China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. He also closed most of his short positions against European stocks but maintained shorts in specific banks like Santander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. His top purchases included high-quality companies like CVS Health, Mastercard, and Google, indicating a rotation towards more stable assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Warren Buffett** added shares in companies like Ally Financial (financing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, Occidental Petroleum (oil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, and Markel (a mini-Berkshire Hathaway) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. He also bought Celanese, a chemical company, which he likely sees as undervalued despite lower growth due to its strong shareholder returns through buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. He tends to rotate into safer, often undervalued, companies when a crisis is foreseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Li Lu** (considered Warren Buffett's successor in China) significantly increased his stake in Alphabet (Google) and maintained positions in Apple and Bank of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>. He also held Micron, a cyclical chip company, which aligns with his concentration in a few key holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.
*   **Robert Vinall** focuses on a concentrated portfolio of 10 quality businesses with [[Predictable businesses in investment | predictable growth and results]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:22">[00:52:22]</a>, such as Credit Acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a> and Facebook (Meta) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>. However, his portfolio suffered in 2022 due to holdings in high-multiple, non-profitable new economy technology companies that collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.

In essence, while some investors might adopt extreme positions (like Michael Burry) or [[Strategies for investing in volatile markets | rotate into safer assets]] (like Ray Dalio and Warren Buffett), the fundamental principle remains: understanding the inherent characteristics of cyclical versus stable businesses is crucial for long-term investment success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

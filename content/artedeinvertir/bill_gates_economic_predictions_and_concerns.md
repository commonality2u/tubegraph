[[Economic predictions by Bill Gates | Bill Gates]], one of the world's wealthiest individuals, has recently issued warnings about a new threat that he believes could jeopardize the global economy [00:00:07]. This concern has prompted him to significantly divest from his investment portfolio [00:00:11]. He suggests this potential crisis could be more severe than recent challenges, necessitating decisive action [00:00:17].

## Bill Gates' Predictive Track Record

[[Economic predictions by Bill Gates | Bill Gates]] has a notable history of making accurate forecasts. In 2019, he anticipated a crisis similar to one that unfolded, though his warnings went unheeded [00:00:54]. He also predicted how that crisis might be resolved, again without widespread attention [00:01:01].

Beyond economic predictions, [[impact_of_bill_gates_forecasts_on_vaccine_development | Bill Gates]] has demonstrated a keen eye for investments, particularly in the healthcare sector [00:01:05]. He invested in the early stages of companies like Novavax and BioNTech [00:01:08]. He even predicted that Pfizer, alongside BioNTech, would be among the first to develop a solution to a significant global health problem [00:01:14].

## [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio_changes | Bill Gates Investment Strategy and Portfolio Changes]]

After co-founding Microsoft, [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] diversified his assets significantly, with Microsoft shares now representing only 2% of his total holdings [00:01:26]. His movements in the investment world are closely watched due to his high success rate and deep understanding of various economic and technological sectors [00:01:38].

### The New Threat Identified

During the annual security conference in Munich, [[economic_predictions_by_bill_gates | Bill Gates]] stated his certainty of another future pandemic, but with a different pathogen [00:02:01]. He also alluded to a new, more immediate threat causing him significant concern [00:02:07].

In response to these identified risks, [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio_changes | Bill Gates]] has been making decisive adjustments to his investment portfolio [00:02:13]. Public investment records in the United States show that his holdings (for investments over $100 million) have seen a significant sell-off [00:02:20]. Recently, he sold 12 out of 18 shares in his portfolio and did not acquire any new shares [00:02:39].

### [[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | Reasons Behind the Accelerated Sales]]

In a CNBC interview, [[economic_predictions_by_bill_gates | Bill Gates]] provided further insight into his accelerated divestment [00:02:57]:
> "It may be that we have not yet seen the worst of this crisis. I am concerned about people's distrust in governments. In the next crisis we would have to act in less than 6 months instead of 2 years that is necessary to trust the governments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>

He also emphasized that [[bill_gates_views_on_technology_and_social_media_regulation | social networks must be regulated]] as they contribute to societal and economic division [00:03:18]. These concerns may explain his decision to sell off a majority of his technology shares [00:03:26].

## Noteworthy Portfolio Moves

[[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio_changes | Bill Gates' capital movements]] reveal three key factors [00:03:33]:

### Sale of Cyclical and High Fixed Cost Companies
He has focused on selling shares in cyclical companies or those with high fixed costs, such as Caterpillar and John Deere [00:03:41]. These types of shares are highly sensitive to economic cycles and tend to fall sharply during downturns [00:03:50].

### Divestment from Technology Sector
[[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | Bill Gates]] sold all his Google shares, one of the few technology companies he had retained [00:04:00]. Following this disclosure, Google's shares plummeted over 25% in less than 45 days [00:04:07]. His only remaining significant technology holding is Microsoft, which constitutes barely 2% of his total assets [00:04:14]. This reduction in technology exposure proved prescient, as the Nasdaq technology index fell over 30% in the first five months of the year [00:04:22].

Last year, he also divested from all his Alibaba shares at $225 per share, just before they dropped to under $90 a year later [00:04:52]. This move helped [[bill_gates_investing_strategies | Bill Gates preserve capital]] [00:05:06].

### Sale of Transportation Sector Shares
[[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | Bill Gates]] sold shares related to the transportation sector, including UPS and FedEx [00:05:11]. These investments had performed excellently but were sold to realize profits [00:05:19]. He also sold his shares in Canadian Pacific Railway [00:05:35].

### Betting Against Tesla
Remarkably, [[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | Bill Gates]] has begun betting against Tesla shares [00:05:41]. Despite being a vocal advocate for climate change and renewable energies, he reportedly dislikes Tesla shares and has had public confrontations with its founder, Elon Musk [00:05:58]. [[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | Bill Gates]] himself drives an electric car, but it is a Porsche Taycan, not a Tesla [00:06:08].

Tesla shares (TSLA) have plummeted by over 50% recently [00:06:25]. While the specific reasons for [[bill_gates_investing_strategies | Bill Gates' decision]] are not fully known, the high valuation of Tesla shares is a likely factor [00:06:37]. Tesla is currently trading at over 50 times earnings, significantly higher than the market average of 16 times earnings [00:07:08]. [[bill_gates_investing_strategies | Bill Gates]] learned from the 2000 tech bubble, where Microsoft shares, despite expected growth, plummeted 50% due to high valuation and took 12 years to recover [00:06:49].

## [[bill_gates_focus_on_defensive_investments_and_sectors | Bill Gates' Focus on Defensive Investments and Sectors]]

Despite concerns about the economy, [[bill_gates_investing_strategies | Bill Gates]] understands the importance of staying invested to counter inflation [00:07:27]. The few stocks he has retained in his portfolio are from highly predictable and defensive sectors, designed to be least affected during an economic crisis [00:07:37]. He has notably excluded technology companies from these retained holdings [00:07:50].

### Ecolab (ECL)
One of the stocks he has kept is Ecolab (ECL) [00:07:57]. Ecolab focuses on water treatment, sanitation, and disinfection products and services for businesses [00:08:05]. The company benefits from a strong reputation and competitive advantage, having multiplied its stock value by over 20 times in the last 20 years [00:08:27]. Ecolab has consistently increased its earnings per share by over 10% annually [00:08:47] and performed well during crises like 2008, 2011, and 2020 [00:08:55]. The company is expected to grow at rates exceeding 15% annually in the coming years, benefiting from new environmental regulations [00:09:15]. Its current valuation of 29 times earnings for the next 12 months compares favorably to its five-year average of 33 times earnings [00:09:31].

### Waste Management (WM)
Another favorite stock [[bill_gates_focus_on_defensive_investments_and_sectors | Bill Gates]] has held onto is Waste Management (WM), the leading garbage collection company in the United States [00:10:07]. This sector is considered predictable, traditional, and resistant to crises, aligning with [[bill_gates_prediction_on_crisis_resolution | Bill Gates' negative view of the future]] [00:10:21]. The company is poised to benefit from the growing trend of waste recycling and environmental respect [00:10:29]. The waste recycling market is projected to grow at 9% annually in the coming years, well above the gross domestic product, especially in North America [00:10:39]. Waste Management has seen impressive stock performance, multiplying by over 60 times, due to its strong competitive advantage in specific regions [00:10:52].

### Other Holdings
[[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] has also decided to keep shares of Canadian Pacific and Coca-Cola FEMSA [00:12:38]. Coca-Cola FEMSA, a bottler for Mexico, is described as another highly defensive and predictable business, consistent with [[bill_gates_focus_on_defensive_investments_and_sectors | Bill Gates' more conservative investment stance]] [00:12:43].

## The Looming Threat: Bioterrorism

The new threat that deeply concerns [[economic_predictions_by_bill_gates | Bill Gates]] and could significantly impact the global economy, according to his own words, is terrorist attacks involving smallpox strains [00:11:26]. He specifically mentioned the risk of these strains being spread massively in public places like airports, stadiums, or shopping centers [00:11:37]. [[bill_gates_prediction_on_crisis_resolution | Bill Gates]] has already urged governments to establish a common fund of over $1 billion annually to control and monitor this risk [00:11:51].

## Other Strategic Moves

[[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio_changes | Bill Gates]] also made a successful move by selling shares of Walmart, which suffered a collapse due to supply chain issues and inflation [00:12:22].

Beyond the stock market, [[bill_gates_investing_strategies | Bill Gates]] has engaged in a massive accumulation of farmland, becoming the largest landowner in the United States [00:13:01]. This strategic move proved successful just before the recent surge in food prices and global inflation [00:13:09].

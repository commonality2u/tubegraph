The "Great Economic Reset," a new economic scenario, is anticipated to affect everyone, including investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This reform, supported by global leaders and prominent businessmen, aims to transform society and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. While presented as beneficial, some of its proposed measures, particularly those concerning taxation, may have negative implications for financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Proposed Tax Increases

One of the primary proposals of the "Great Economic Reset" is a significant increase in taxes for both individuals and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This mechanism appears to be already underway in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

The proposed tax increases are driven by two main factors:
*   **Government Debt** Governments have accumulated substantial debt following recent crises and need to generate more tax revenue to repay these obligations and support the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Sector Promotion** Increased taxes are also intended to fund and boost sectors recommended by the World Economic Forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Key Figures and Policy
Janet Yellen, former president of the Federal Reserve and soon to be Secretary of the Treasury, is expected to hold significant economic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The economic plan of President Joe Biden, a proponent of the World Economic Forum's reforms, includes many of these tax-related proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Yellen has stated that the recovery plan will prioritize raising taxes on the wealthy, who benefited from the 2017 Republican tax cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Taxation of Unrealized Profits
A more radical proposal by Janet Yellen is to impose taxes on unrealized profits in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This would mean that if a stock is purchased for $10 and its value increases to $14 by year-end, taxes would be due on the $4 profit, even if the shares have not been sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Such a measure would significantly discourage investment in the stock market and could have a negative [[impact_of_interest_rate_hikes_on_financial_markets | effect on the markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Historical Context and Market Impact

In 2017, the United States saw one of its largest tax cuts, a trend followed by many other countries creating more favorable tax environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This tax cut led to accelerated profits for companies in the S&P 500 between 2016 and 2018, contributing to very bullish and positive stock market performance during those years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

Conversely, a reversal of these tax cuts could have the opposite [[impact_of_interest_rate_hikes_on_financial_markets | effect on the stock markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Some analysts predict a potential drop of 15% to 20% in the American stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Investment Strategies in a Changing Tax Environment

Despite the potential for increased taxes, certain investments may be less affected or even benefit.

### Large American Technology Companies
Large American technology companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon, while having risen significantly, are considered to be listed at reasonable valuations given their high current profits and future growth prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. A potential tax increase in the U.S. may not affect them as negatively as other more localized companies, as a significant portion of their taxes are declared abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
Companies structured as REITs in the U.S. have a special tax regime: if they distribute the majority of their profits as dividends to shareholders, they do not pay corporate taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Therefore, even with a general tax increase on traditional companies, these REITs would likely remain unaffected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

Equinix (NYSE: EQIX) is an example of a REIT that specializes in building and renting data centers, housing large processors for storing and processing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Its clients include major technology companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This company is expected to significantly benefit from the "Fourth Industrial Revolution," which proposes an exponential increase in data processing and internet traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### Impact of Inflation on Investments
It's important to note that the measures proposed by the "Great Economic Reset" are considered inflationary, as new money must be printed to finance large investments and governments must go into debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. In an [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflationary environment]], gold tends to perform well as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Ray Dalio, a prominent global investor and regular attendee of the Davos forum, holds significant amounts of gold in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

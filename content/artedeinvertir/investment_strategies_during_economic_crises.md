The year 2022 has been marked by significant volatility in the economy and global stock markets, affecting everyone regardless of their investment activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This volatility stems from four major crises: transport, inflation, semiconductors, and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Understanding how these crises impact the financial landscape is crucial for developing effective [[investment_strategies during economic downturns | investment strategies during economic downturns]] and [[strategies_for_protecting_investments_during_economic_crises | strategies for protecting investments during economic crises]].

## The Impact of Economic Crises on Investments

Economic crises affect various aspects of the economy, including consumption, stock market valuations, and business profits.

### Transport Crisis
A global logistical collapse has led to jammed ports and soaring transport costs, which have multiplied by five times for a typical container, from $1,500-$2,000 to over $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This results in supply problems and higher costs for goods, impacting all products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The head of logistics at Uber described the situation as an "Armageddon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The crisis is exacerbated by labor shortages in transport sectors (maritime, road, air) due to confinements and an evolving economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

The immediate implications include:
*   **Inflation:** Increased costs lead to higher prices across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Reduced Consumption:** Higher prices decrease people's disposable income, negatively affecting consumption, which accounts for 70% of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Stock Market Decline:** Reduced business profits will lead to lower share valuations and stock market declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Inflation Crisis
Inflation is considered a serious problem, with data in the United States showing the highest figures in the last 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The Federal Reserve, responsible for monetary policy, initially minimized the risk but called an emergency meeting to address the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This could significantly modify the economic scenario and stock market evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

The cost of a coffee in the US has increased tenfold since the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Inflation is often called the "tax of the working class" because it silently decreases wealth, savings, and income by reducing purchasing power, even if nominal money amounts remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Implications of rising inflation and interest rates include:
*   **Increased Mortgage Costs:** Most people have mortgages, and rising interest rates will increase their costs, especially for variable-rate mortgages common in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. A 1% increase could raise mortgage payments by 30-40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Stock Market Valuation Adjustments:** Stock market assets are valued based on bonds and interest rates. If bond profitability or inflation rises, stock market valuations fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Loss of Purchasing Power for Conservative Investments:** Everything considered "safe" like money in the bank, bonds, and fixed income is losing value. A 7% annual loss means a 20-30% loss over 3-4 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Semiconductor (Chip) Crisis
There is a gigantic global shortage of semiconductors, described as "alarming" by the US Department of Commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This occurred because lockdowns led to a reduction in chip production capacity and a redirection of production to electronic devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. When economies reopened, sectors like automobiles, which are major chip consumers, faced insufficient supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

This shortage leads to:
*   **Rising Prices:** Lack of supply drives up prices, contributing to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. For example, the price index for used cars in the US has literally doubled, with some used cars costing more than new ones due to scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Increased Costs for Consumers:** Prices of anything with electronic components are rising rapidly, impacting consumers through higher costs for cars, insurance, food, and other goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **Reduced Company Profits:** Many companies see their profit margins squeezed due to increased component costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

### Energy Crisis
The energy crisis is tremendously important, as everyone consumes energy. Companies face huge deficits due to:
*   **Geopolitical Tensions:** Conflicts in the Middle East and tensions with Russia (a major energy producer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **Reduced Investment in Fossil Fuels:** Discouragement of oil extraction due to "dirty energy" perceptions and penalized financing costs for exploration projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
*   **Demand-Supply Imbalance:** The world consumes about 100 million barrels per day, but fewer are produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Renewable energies, though growing, cannot compensate for the deficit due to higher costs and unpredictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

Oil prices have risen from $59 to nearly $94, levels not seen in seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. Electricity costs in Europe have multiplied by five times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. This again leads to inflation and less disposable income for consumers, as more money is spent on utilities instead of consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

## [[Investment strategies during economic crises | Investment Strategies During Economic Crises]]

In light of these crises, specific [[investment_strategies in light of potential market crises | investment strategies in light of potential market crises]] can be employed to protect and grow capital.

### General Principles
*   **Invest to Counter Inflation:** The only solution to inflation is to invest, as conservative options like bank deposits and fixed income lose value rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Investments should target returns higher than inflation (currently 7%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.
*   **Consider the Stock Market:** The stock market, despite its volatility, remains the most accessible option for many people to generate profitability, provided one invests knowledgeably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Explore Real Estate:** Real estate investments are another option to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Review Debts:** For debtors, securing fixed-rate mortgages can be beneficial in an inflationary scenario, protecting against rising interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Think Long Term:** Crises are temporary, and while there will be volatility and temporary losses, panicking and making bad decisions should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### Identifying Benefiting Sectors and Companies
A key [[investing_strategies_for_economic_downturns | investing strategies for economic downturns]] is to analyze sectors that benefit from the current environment, as there is always a "bull market" somewhere, even in the worst crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

#### Transport Sector Beneficiaries
While overall transport costs are rising, some companies benefit:
*   **C.H. Robinson:** A high-quality company in the Dow Jones transport index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.
*   **XPO Logistics:** Connects transport companies with those needing transport, profiting from increased transport costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.
*   **Union Pacific (Rail Transport):** Offers very low and predictable transport costs, performing well due to bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.
*   **TFI International (TFII):** A small Canadian company that has significantly risen since 2020 by acquiring and improving small transport companies, benefiting from increasing transport rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

#### Chip/Semiconductor Sector Beneficiaries
*   **ETFs (e.g., SOXX):** Investing in an ETF offers a basket of semiconductor stocks, diversifying risk. The SOXX index has shown significant bullish behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.
*   **Micron Technology:** One of three companies (along with Samsung and SK Hynix) that form an oligopoly in RAM memory manufacturing. As component prices rise, these companies benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. Micron has seen its valuation almost triple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.
*   **TSMC:** The largest global producer of microchips, manufacturing for major tech companies like AMD and Apple. Benefits directly from rising chip manufacturing and selling costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>.

#### Automobile Sector Beneficiaries
Surprisingly, even with chip shortages, some auto companies benefit by raising prices:
*   **General Motors, Ford, Tesla:** Despite producing fewer cars due to chip shortages, they have significantly raised prices. Consumers continue to buy, leading to tremendously increased profit margins and earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.
*   **CarMax:** A major used car retailer. Its existing inventory suddenly doubles in value, as cars bought at lower prices are sold at inflated prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

#### Energy Sector Beneficiaries
Various types of energy companies are benefiting from the energy crisis:
*   **Exploration & Production (E&P) Companies:**
    *   **Cenovus Natural Resources (CNQ):** One of Canada's largest energy producers and well-managed, with shares almost doubling and offering dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. It trades at a lower valuation than its historical average, implying high current profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.
    *   **International Petroleum (Hippo):** At current oil levels, it trades at a low valuation, implying a 25% profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
    *   **Tourmaline:** Considered one of the best-managed E&P companies with good historical profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
*   **Integrated Companies:** Companies like Shell, Total, and BP, which own extraction, refining, and distribution (e.g., gas stations), benefit from rising energy prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>.
*   **Support Services:** Companies providing engineering support, component parts (e.g., Lamberger, National Oilwell Varco), or even accommodation services for workers in remote energy regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.
*   **Refining Companies:** Companies that refine oil or gas into derivatives like kerosene or gasoline. Their profit margins increase if the selling price of derivatives rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.
    *   **Cheniere Energy:** Has a near monopoly in liquefied natural gas (LNG) export infrastructure in the US. Benefits from the US gas surplus and exporting it at higher prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.
*   **Electrical Distribution Companies:** Typical electrical companies that raise prices for consumers also benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

The current economic scenario, marked by transport, inflation, chip, and energy crises, generates significant volatility. While these situations pose risks to consumption and overall market valuations, they also present opportunities for investors who strategically identify and invest in benefiting sectors and companies. Focusing on companies with strong market positions, those that can pass on rising costs, or those whose core business intrinsically benefits from the inflationary environment can be effective [[investment_strategies during economic volatility | investment strategies during economic volatility]] and [[investment_strategies_to_protect_against_economic_downturns | investment strategies to protect against economic downturns]]. Thinking long-term and understanding market dynamics are essential for navigating these challenging times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

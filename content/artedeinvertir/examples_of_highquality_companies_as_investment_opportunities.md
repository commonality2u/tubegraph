Investing in [[investment_opportunities_in_quality_stocks | high-quality companies]] at attractive prices, especially during widespread market sell-offs, is a strategy favored by some of the world's best investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This approach focuses on understanding companies before investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, targeting those with solid competitive positions and low debt that are likely to emerge stronger from economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Learning from Legendary Investors

Learning to invest effectively involves studying and modeling the techniques of successful investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### David Tepper's Approach
David Tepper, founder of Appaloosa Management, is known for his impressive 30-year track record, generating an annual return of 25% for clients, surpassing even Warren Buffett during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Tepper has a reputation for being one of the "bravest printers" on Wall Street, buying stocks when other investors panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. His best returns have historically followed periods of market panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

In a recent interview, Tepper advised that investors should focus on [[understanding_companies_before_investing | investing in good companies]] with strong competitive positions and no debt, as weaker, indebted companies may not survive economic difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. He expressed confidence that many companies would be worth significantly more in one to two years than their current trading prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. At the time, he stated he was buying stocks in the healthcare sector and large technology companies like Amazon, Google, and Alibaba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Bill Ackman's Strategy
Bill Ackman, another legendary Wall Street investor, has generated annual returns of over 16% for his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. He is noted for his ability to navigate bearish periods, losing only 13% with his fund in 2008 while the S&P 500 lost nearly 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. After initially being "super bearish," Ackman turned bullish, aggressively buying shares of Hilton, Restaurant Brands, and Starbucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Airbus (AIR)
*   **Sector**: Aerospace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>
*   **Ticker**: A&R (listed in France) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
*   **Current Situation**: Airbus is currently at the "epicenter of the storm" due to a widespread sell-off in airline-related stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Quality Characteristics**:
    *   **Oligopoly**: The commercial aviation business is an oligopoly dominated by Boeing and Airbus, a trend observed for the past 50 years and expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
    *   **Predictable Business**: Airbus has a highly predictable business with an order book of 8,000 aircraft, equivalent to 480 billion euros or seven years of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. New orders can have a waiting period of up to eight years for delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
    *   **Low Debt/High Liquidity**: The company's balance sheet shows a liquidity surplus of 12 billion dollars, which is equivalent to 20% of its market capitalization or more than 14 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Valuation**:
    *   Adjusting for excess liquidity, Airbus was trading at a low valuation of only 8 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
    *   Historically, high-quality companies like Airbus rarely trade below 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
    *   A target valuation based on 20 times normalized earnings suggests a price of 120 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
    *   With projected earnings growth, a five-year target valuation could be close to 200 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

### United Healthcare (UNH)
*   **Sector**: Healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>

    *   **Defensive Business**: Healthcare is a very defensive business, as people rarely cancel their health insurance even during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The company increased sales and profits during the 2008-2009 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
    *   **Strong Performance**: Over the last 30 years, its shares have grown from $1 to over $240 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
    *   **Low Debt**: United Healthcare has low debt on its balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

### Restaurant Brands International (QSR)
*   **Sector**: Fast Food/Restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>

*   **Current Situation**: Shares have fallen 50% from their highs due to restaurant closures and current market sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Quality Characteristics**:
    *   **Resilient Business**: Fast food stocks have historically been excellent [[investment_opportunities_outside_the_tech_sector | investment ideas]] and are very resilient during economic crises due to their low-priced menus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. McDonald's, for example, increased sales even in 2008-2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
    *   **Franchise Model**: Restaurant Brands International primarily receives royalties from franchisees rather than operating restaurants directly, requiring less investment and making it a better business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
    *   **Government Support**: Government aid for small business owners operating these franchises has mitigated some risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Valuation**:
    *   Free cash flow of $1.4 billion over the last 12 months, leading to an adjusted valuation of 8 times earnings against its $11.7 billion market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
    *   Fast food companies rarely trade below 15 times earnings, which is considered a valuation floor for the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
    *   Assuming a return to previous earnings levels ($2.4 billion) and valuing at 15 times earnings, a target value of $80 per share is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
    *   **Future Growth Plan**: The company plans to grow from 26,000 to 40,000 restaurants in the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, potentially increasing profits from $1.4 billion to $2 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
    *   Valuing future profits at 15 times earnings suggests a target value of $120 per share in 3-5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

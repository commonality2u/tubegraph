Warren Buffett initiated his first major investment of 2020 by investing $10 billion in the energy sector, specifically in natural gas transportation assets, leveraging favorable prices offered by market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This move into a sector considered "least appreciated by the market today" aligns with his investment philosophy: "be greedy when others are greedy and vice versa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Currently, the energy sector is viewed with fear by investors, leading to attractive [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Historically, low points in the energy sector relative to the S&P 500 (as seen in the 1970s or early 2000s) have been the most attractive times to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. For instance, in 2002, when this indicator was at its lowest, Buffett invested $500 million in Petrochina, multiplying his investment eightfold in less than five years to $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Natural Gas Investment

Warren Buffett, through Berkshire Hathaway, purchased Dominion Energy's natural gas transportation assets for $10 billion, including $6 billion in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This strategic acquisition focuses on "much safer" assets like gas storage terminals and transportation lines, rather than direct natural gas production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Post-announcement, Dominion's shares fell over 6%, suggesting the market perceived it as a less favorable deal for the seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Advantages of Natural Gas Transportation and Storage Companies
Natural gas extractors face high fixed costs and lack control over sale prices, leading to unpredictable profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. In contrast, gas pipeline and transportation companies offer significant advantages:
*   **Fixed Rates**: They charge clients a fixed rate for pipeline usage or based on volume transported, independent of the gas price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Local Monopolies**: Dominating a main transportation line makes it difficult for new competitors to obtain licenses, fostering stable, prospering businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. These companies often pay high dividends to shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

Warren Buffett now controls 18% of all natural gas transportation lines in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Why Natural Gas?
Two key reasons drive Buffett's interest in this asset class:
1.  **US Production and Export**: Thanks to fracking and sergas technology, the US has become the world's largest natural gas producer, producing more than it consumes domestically. This necessitates gas transportation lines for planned exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
2.  **Clean Energy Transition**: Natural gas is a cheap and cleaner energy source compared to coal or oil. It is projected to have significant growth in the economy over the next 20 years as part of the transition to more environmentally friendly energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

These businesses offer attractive [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuations]], good future prospects, and often distribute high dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities in Natural Gas Stocks

It is crucial to remember that a good company does not always equal a good investment if its [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuation]] is illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Conversely, less stellar companies can be good investments if listed at very attractive [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. While short-term [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuation]] may seem irrelevant, it is a determining factor in the long term, alongside business performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### Kinder Morgan (KMI)
Kinder Morgan, listed in the US under ticker KMI at $14 per share, is the largest natural gas transportation company in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. The founding family still owns 14% of the shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

Despite recent falls in natural gas prices, these companies are largely insulated because 98% of Kinder Morgan's contracts are at a fixed rate or based on volume transported, not gas price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The key factor for gas transportation companies is gas consumption, which is very resilient, even in times of crisis, as it is an essential good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Kinder Morgan confirmed that its profits would fall by a modest 6% this year due to lower consumption during confinement, not gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

The market often moves between extremes of euphoria and pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. In 2014, Kinder Morgan shares traded at $40 with $4.6 billion in profits. Six years later, profits remain at $4.6 billion, but shares trade at $14, reflecting a shift from euphoria to pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

For this year, Kinder Morgan expects to earn $2 per share and distribute $1 as a dividend, yielding an interesting 7% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Historically, gas pipeline shares have traded at an average of 15 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Using this multiple, a target price of $30 per share can be derived ($2 earnings x 15), with potential to expand to $40 per share over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This represents a significant potential for [[valuation_and_growth_potential_of_companies | realization]] given the current $14 price, in a monopoly sector with Warren Buffett's backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

### Cheniere Energy Partners (CQP)
Cheniere Energy Partners, listed under ticker CQP at $33 per share, specializes in natural gas storage and export assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. To export gas, it must be converted from a gaseous to a liquid state, a process handled by Cheniere's facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. Obtaining licenses for these export terminals or gas pipelines is extremely difficult, creating monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. These storage and processing companies tend to perform well in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

Global demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) is projected to continue increasing, benefiting this company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Like Kinder Morgan, Cheniere Energy Partners has tremendous stability and income visibility, with 80.5% of its contracts at fixed rates and an average duration of 19 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Its clients are solvent, large energy companies like Iberdrola, Total, or Endesa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

The company has not been adversely affected by the current crisis; in fact, it decided to increase its dividend payment in the first two quarters of this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Cheniere confirmed that its profits for this year will increase between 5% and 10% compared to the previous year, and it will pay an annual dividend equivalent to 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

Stable and predictable companies like this typically trade at or above 15 times earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. The company estimates that within three years, its profits could reach almost $4 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Multiplying this by 15 times earnings gives a 3-year target price of $60 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Adding approximately $8 in collected dividends over the next three years, the total value could reach $68 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. This represents a very interesting potential for [[valuation_and_performance_of_specific_stocks_and_sectors | realization]] from its current $33 price, coupled with a 7% annual dividend yield, in a good, stable business with strong long-term prospects, and backed by Warren Buffett's investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

For these reasons, the natural gas transportation and storage sector presents attractive [[opportunities_in_natural_gas_transportation_and_storage | opportunities in natural gas transportation and storage]] with favorable [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

Recent statements from members of the Federal Reserve (Fed) indicate that a recession is "practically imminent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This perspective, shared by figures like a former president of the New York Federal Reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, highlights the potential for significant repercussions on the stock market, investments, and daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The Fed's commitment to [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | combating inflation]] is a driving factor behind these concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Economic Outlook and Recession Predictions
A former president of the Federal Reserve in New York believes a recession is inevitable by 2023, possibly within the next six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This is attributed to the necessity for central banks to act against [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. While a 20% market drop without a recession is common, a recession could lead to a "much more serious" downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Investment banks estimate the probability of a recession in the next 12 months at 75-80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

The president of the Atlanta Fed estimates that the growth of the second quarter's American GDP may be around 0% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Given that the first quarter was already negative, two consecutive quarters of decline are considered a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

Historically, bullish cycles of [[impact_of_central_bank_policies_on_economic_conditions | rate hikes]] by the Fed have consistently ended with negative economic or financial events:
*   **1998:** Russia's bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>
*   **2000:** Dot-com bubble burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>
*   **2008:** Subprime mortgage crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>
*   **1994:** Collapse of emerging countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>
*   **1987:** Also coincided with rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>

The average market drop without a recession is typically 21% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. When a recession occurs, the average S&P 500 fall is 24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. While some falls have been deeper, the current situation is generally incorporated into market expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## Role of Liquidity in Markets
[[understanding_market_cycles_and_economic_indicators | Liquidity]] is a determining factor in short and medium-term market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. There is a high correlation between global money supply (liquidity) and the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. When money supply is restricted, the market tends to move sideways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

The Fed's balance sheet, particularly the "reverse repos facility," influences market liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Banks and institutions can deposit money with the Fed to earn interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. When the Fed raises short-term rates, it incentivizes banks to deposit money, effectively draining liquidity from the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This money is then not available for investments in the stock market, company startups, or lending, which otherwise would stimulate the economy and increase demand (contributing to [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. The money deposited in reverse repos has skyrocketed to roughly two trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, significantly draining liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

## Market Sentiment and Opportunities
Market sentiment is currently "very, very negative," at levels last seen in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. However, this negative sentiment often creates a fertile ground for future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. European consumer confidence is also at a minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. When sentiment is this negative, improvement is often the only way, leading to economic recovery and a rising stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

> [!TIP] Investing in the stock market requires looking to the future, not the past. While historical data provides references, the price of an asset is determined by its future prospects (next 12-24 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

## Commodity Prices as Economic Indicators
Several commodity prices, considered [[economic_indicators_and_their_impact_on_stock_markets | economic indicators]], have seen significant declines since May:
*   **Iron ore** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>
*   **Copper:** Often seen as a key indicator of economic health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>
*   **Aluminum** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>
*   **Steel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>

Oil was the only commodity holding up, but it has also begun to plummet, dropping from $120 to $105-$110 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. Oil is a major cause of [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] due to its impact on production costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

Supply chain problems, exacerbated by China's lockdowns, led to high shipping costs (e.g., $20,000 for a container from China to the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. These costs have since dropped by half, suggesting potential moderation in [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

## Microeconomic Insights on Inflation
Company CEOs, experiencing the economy firsthand, provide fresh reports on conditions. Darden Restaurants, for example, reported that "the worst of the [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] in commodities seems to be already in the rearview mirror" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.

Inflation has been primarily driven by supply-side bottlenecks and disruptions (e.g., COVID-19 lockdowns), accounting for about 4 percentage points of the current 7% inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. Demand-side factors also contribute, but the market expects moderation, bringing inflation closer to the Fed's target of 2-3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

## Investment Performance During Downturns
Historically, after "very serious falls" in the market, investments tend to perform exceptionally well. There is no negative period found in 1, 3, or 5-year returns after massive market drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. The deeper the fall, the safer it is to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.

*   The average bear market typically sees a 33% decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a> and lasts approximately 14 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   In contrast, bullish cycles last much longer, averaging 70 months (over 5 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>, with returns of almost 300% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

This highlights the importance of a long-term perspective in investment, focusing on risk/reward ratios over short-term losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## Sector Performance in Rising Rate Environments
JP Morgan's analysis indicates that in periods of rising rates, banks and financial services companies tend to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. Conversely, sectors related to consumption, healthcare, and telecommunications can be negatively affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

## Stock Characteristics for Recovery
When anticipating market recovery, stocks with:
*   **Low debt:** Tend to recover more than the general market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.
*   **High reinvestment:** Companies that reinvest significantly during crises often perform best during recoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. This strategy allows them to gain market share or acquire competitors at lower prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.

## Market Valuation Indicators
The earnings yield of the S&P 500 minus the 10-year bond yield (often considered the risk-free asset) can indicate how expensive or cheap the stock market is compared to alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>. Warren Buffett noted that when the bond yield was very high (e.g., 15-20% in the 1980s), stocks offering a lower return (e.g., 5% from a P/E of 20) were less attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. Historically, high additional profitability of the market relative to bonds (like 6% in the late 1970s) marked excellent times to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.

Currently, the S&P 500 offers about a 6.5% yield (trading at ~15 times earnings), which is above its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>. The difference from the 10-year bond yield indicates a positive outlook, marking one of the highest positive moments historically, similar to the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

Another indicator is the number of shares trading at very low multiples (e.g., 3 times operating profits). In times of extreme panic or recession, paradoxically, there are more cheap shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. For example, in 2000-2001 and 2008, a significant percentage of the S&P 3000 (20-30%) traded at these ultra-low valuations, historically signaling excellent times to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.

## Case Studies: Companies in the Current Environment
JP Morgan's "top picks" for 2022 include:

### Fisher (Financial Services)
*   Historically, Fisher has been a spectacular performer, multiplying investor money by over 300 times since the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.
*   Operates in the growing credit card ecosystem, specifically facilitating payment information flow at points of sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.
*   It's an oligopoly with limited price competition, allowing for price increases above cost during inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>.
*   Fisher is a non-cyclical growth stock; its profits increased even during the 2020 confinement and are expected to continue growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.
*   During the 2008-2010 financial crisis, it increased operating profits and bought back over 100 million shares, significantly increasing earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.
*   Currently trading at 13 times earnings, below its historical average of 21-24 times, partly due to market perception of newer payment technologies like Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>.

### Bank of America (Banking)
*   A major US bank, part of a more concentrated and less competitive banking ecosystem post-2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.
*   Banks are cyclical businesses, but Bank of America benefits significantly from rising interest rates. A 1% increase in rates could boost its profit by $6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.
*   Its earnings per share are projected to rise significantly due to rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>.
*   The primary risk is a recession leading to increased loan delinquencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.
*   Its valuation is at its lowest since the 2008 crisis, only slightly above the March 2020 lows, trading at 12 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.

### Lennar (Homebuilding)
*   A major homebuilder, operating in a highly cyclical sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.
*   Shares have dropped significantly, trading at only 5 times earnings, implying a 20% profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.
*   Historically, similar companies trade at 8-9 times earnings, but Lennar is currently at 4 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>, and its valuation is below the March 2020 lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>.
*   The main risk is the rise in US 30-year mortgage rates (to 5.78%), which could lead to lower house prices and excess housing supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.
*   Despite risks, the US population grows, creating continuous demand for new homes (around 1.5 million homes needed annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.
*   Current housing inventories are below the historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.
*   Lennar's profits have tripled recently due to low rates and high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>. The market price suggests a reversion to pre-euphoria earnings levels (e.g., $6 earnings per share) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>.

### Other Companies Mentioned:
*   **StoneCo (payments in Brazil):** Benefited from high bank fees but now faces increased competition, leading to slower growth and decreased margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>.
*   **Zendesk (cloud software):** Trades at a high 90 times earnings, despite a significant drop, suggesting it may still be expensive relative to growth forecasts compared to other software companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>.
*   **Berkshire Hathaway (Warren Buffett's company):** Initially rose due to inflation expectations but then declined with changing market sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:23">[01:21:23]</a>. Warren Buffett believes it is undervalued based on its book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.
*   **Canadian Natural Resources (oil and gas):** One of Canada's top oil companies, benefited from high oil prices but is correcting as expectations of inflation calming down and reduced oil demand grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Be cautious with inverse ETFs; they have historically led to "tremendous ruin" for investors as they decay over time, even if the market falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>. They are not recommended for long-term investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:52">[01:09:52]</a>.

## Conclusion on Current Market Environment
The current market environment, characterized by negativity and low valuations, presents significant investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:43">[01:33:43]</a>. Companies with low debt and good business models are less affected by [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] or [[impact_of_central_bank_policies_on_economic_conditions | interest rate hikes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:48">[01:33:48]</a>. It's crucial to approach the market with caution, informed decision-making, and a long-term perspective to navigate volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:27">[01:35:27]</a>.

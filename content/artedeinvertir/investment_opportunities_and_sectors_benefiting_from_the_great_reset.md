From: [[artedeinvertir]] <br/> 

The "Great Reset" is a new economic scenario and reform proposed by the World Economic Forum (WEF), an organization founded by Klaus Schwab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This initiative, which has the support of powerful global figures like heads of government and big businessmen, aims for a total transformation of society and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. While presented as beneficial, some of its proposed reforms may have negative aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Despite potential challenges, certain sectors are expected to benefit disproportionately and experience significant growth under this new plan, presenting [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investment opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Core Areas of Reform and Their Investment Impact
The Great Reset's reforms fundamentally focus on three areas: social, economic, and environmental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. In a capitalist system, new economic measures will revolve around these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### 1. Tax Increases
One of the first proposals, affecting everyone, is an increase in taxes for both individuals and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This is primarily due to government debt incurred during recent crises and the need to boost sectors recommended by the World Economic Forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

In the United States, this mechanism appears to be underway, with Janet Yellen, the incoming Treasury Secretary, prioritizing raising taxes on the wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. She even proposed taxing unrealized stock market profits, which could discourage investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. If 2017 tax cuts are reversed, stock markets could see a negative effect, with some analysts estimating a 15-20% drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

However, certain [[sectorspecific_investment_opportunities | investments]] may be unaffected by these tax increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### 2. Environmental Focus and Carbon Emissions
The Great Reset emphasizes promoting "zero emissions balance" and clean energy sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This includes tremendous aid to renewable energy and new taxes to discourage highly polluting energies like oil and coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

The Davos 2021 forum agenda is heavily focused on renewable energies and carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. The Biden administration has committed over $2 trillion in aid to the renewable energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This explains the strong performance of this sector on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

This shift discourages investment in highly polluting energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, but has generated new [[examples_of_investment_opportunities_in_affected_sectors | investment opportunities]] in:
*   Electric cars (e.g., Tesla) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>
*   Wind generation (e.g., Gamesa, Siemens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
*   Solar energy (e.g., Jinko Solar, Canadian Solar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>

**Investment Vehicles**:
There are several ETFs related to the renewable energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>:
*   **Nasdaq Clean Energy** (ticker: CELS), listed in the US, has risen over 300% in less than two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Eye Search Global Clean Energy**, a European alternative, listed in Germany, also shows excellent performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### 3. The Fourth Industrial Revolution (New Technologies)
This reform promotes all new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The European Union's official website shows significant aid, over 140 billion euros, planned for innovation and technological development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This forces governments and companies to invest in new technological projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

As a result, the Nasdaq and technology stocks have been top performers, benefiting tremendously from this "fourth industrial revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

**Benefiting Companies**:
Large American technology companies are among the most benefited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, including:
*   Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>
*   Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>
*   Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>

These companies often declare a large part of their taxes abroad, making them less negatively affected by potential US tax increases compared to more local companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

#### Specific Technology [[evaluating_investment_opportunities_in_technology_and_energy_sectors | Investment Opportunities]]

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>
> [!EXAMPLE] Qualcomm (QCOM)
> Qualcomm (ticker: QCOM) is a leading technology company specializing in microchips and processors, primarily for smartphones with its Snapdragon processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The company holds over 140,000 patents worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
>
> Qualcomm is well-positioned to benefit from the promotion of 5G technology, a key agenda item of the Great Reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The company also generates significant income from licensing its patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
>
> With expected free cash flow of around $9 billion, Qualcomm's current valuation is about 20 times earnings, below the market average for a high-quality, high-growth company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Assuming moderate growth of 10% per year and a trade at 25 times earnings, a target value above $250 is possible, compared to its current $160 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>
> [!EXAMPLE] Equinix (EQIX)
> Equinix (ticker: EQIX) is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that benefits from a special US tax regime: if a REIT pays the majority of its profits in dividends to shareholders, it does not pay corporate taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This means Equinix would be unaffected by corporate tax increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
>
> Equinix specializes in building and renting data centers that house large processors to store or process information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Its clients include major technology companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
>
> The company is poised to benefit tremendously from the Fourth Industrial Revolution, as the amount of data processed and transported via the internet is set to increase exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Its adjusted profits (FFO) tripled from $700 million in 2014 to $2.1 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
>
> While currently trading at a demanding 30 times earnings, this is justified by the business's high predictability and practically assured growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. With an expected growth of at least 15%, its value could reach $1,400, compared to its current $770 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

### 4. Promotion of Socially Committed Companies (ESG Criteria)
The Great Reset also seeks to promote investment in companies that are socially committed, adhering to what is known as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Traditionally, company priority was shareholders, but this new thought aims for all stakeholders to benefit, including social, environmental, and human aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

[[investing_in_undervalued_sectors_amid_market_euphoria | Investment in companies]] meeting these ESG criteria set by the World Economic Forum has shown exceptional performance in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. A lot of capital is flowing into this area of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

**Examples of ESG Companies (S&P 500)**:
*   Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>
*   United Health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>
*   Procter & Gamble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>

## General Investment Considerations
The measures proposed by the Great Reset are inflationary, as new money must be printed and governments incur debt to finance large investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>
> [!INFO] Gold as an Inflation Hedge
> In an inflationary environment, gold is an asset that tends to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Notably, Ray Dalio, a regular member of the Davos forum and manager of the world's largest investment fund, holds significant amounts of gold in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This highlights [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_energy_sectors | investment opportunities in gold and energy sectors]].

Despite new measures, the world tends to improve and generate wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. One of the best ways to capitalize on and benefit from this economic progress is through long-term [[analysis_of_investment_opportunities_in_various_sectors_including_technology_and_transport | investment in stocks and the stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

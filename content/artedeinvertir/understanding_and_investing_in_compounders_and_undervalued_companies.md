The "Art of Investing" aims to explore how to invest and gain knowledge in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>. A key focus is on understanding and investing in companies that can generate sustained returns, often referred to as "compounders," and identifying [[strategies_for_finding_undervalued_stocks | undervalued companies]]. This approach is particularly relevant in periods of high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Impact of Inflation on Investments

Inflation, which has recently reached around 4-5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, significantly changes the investment landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Major investors like Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, and Ray Dalio have warned that inflation could be more prolonged than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Inflation erodes the value of money over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. For example, the dollar has lost 80-90% of its value over 40-50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Warren Buffett highlights that if inflation is 5% and a safe investment yields 5%, the real return is zero, akin to a 100% tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Money held in fixed-term deposits or liquidity loses value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

Central banks raising rates to combat inflation can cause market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Ray Dalio warns that tightening economic conditions (raising interest rates, ending quantitative easing) will negatively impact markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

To counter inflation, it is crucial to invest in [[investment_opportunities_in_traditional_companies | productive assets]], with stocks often being the most preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's "Toll Bridge" Investment Philosophy

Warren Buffett recommends [[investing_in_exceptional_businesses | investing in businesses]] that act like a "toll bridge" during periods of high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. These companies possess specific characteristics:
*   **Prior Investment with "Old Dollars":** They have already made the bulk of their capital investment in the past, when money was worth more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Ability to Raise Prices:** They can increase prices in proportion to inflation, boosting their income without needing to invest more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Predictable and Recurring Demand:** Consumers must spend money on their products or services, regardless of economic conditions (e.g., toothpaste, fast food) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Low Ongoing Capital Expenditure (Capex):** Their investment needs to grow are low, allowing profits to skyrocket as revenue increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

These businesses often perform well in any economic environment, inflationary or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

## Examples of "Toll Bridge" Companies

Here are five examples of investment opportunities fitting Warren Buffett's recommendations:

### 1. Moody's
*   **Business:** Provides debt ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, which are essential for bonds regardless of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.
*   **"Old Dollars" Characteristic:** Moody's has already built its brand image and reputation over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>. It does not need to invest significantly to maintain or grow its core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>.
*   **Financials:** From 2015 to 2022, operating cash flow is estimated to grow from $1 billion to $2.5 billion (12% annual growth), while annual investment (capex) only increased from $74 million to $94 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>.
*   **Pricing Power:** It can raise prices at or above the rate of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>, saving clients significant interest on their bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>.
*   **Performance:** Has practically tripled in value since 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>, demonstrating resilience across economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>. It typically trades at 27-28 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:13">[01:21:13]</a>.

### 2. Gold Royalty Companies (e.g., Franco Nevada)
*   **Business:** These companies finance gold mining projects and receive future gold production as royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:30">[02:23:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:07">[02:40:07]</a>. They have more expertise in valuing mining projects than traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:54">[02:32:54]</a>.
*   **"Old Dollars" Characteristic:** Franco Nevada has already made its investments in the mines it finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:48">[02:48:48]</a>.
*   **Inflation Hedge:** As inflation rises, the price of gold tends to increase, boosting their royalties, while their costs remain fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:56">[02:43:56]</a>.
*   **Performance:** Franco Nevada has seen its stock price rise from $25 to $140 over 10 years, plus dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:42">[02:44:42]</a>. It has given an average annual return of 20% since its inception (2007), outperforming Nasdaq, S&P 500, gold itself, and traditional gold mining companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>.

### 3. Restaurant Franchise Royalty Companies (e.g., MT)
*   **Business:** MT owns the rights to franchise royalties (a percentage of restaurant sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:11">[02:08:11]</a>. Fast food performs well even during crises or high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:40">[02:07:40]</a>.
*   **"Old Dollars" Characteristic:** MT has already bought these franchises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:39">[02:09:39]</a>.
*   **Inflationary Benefits:** If restaurant menus increase due to inflation, MT's revenue automatically goes up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:18">[02:09:18]</a>. The franchisees bear the primary cost increases (food, rent, labor), while MT's central office costs remain relatively stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:41">[02:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>.
*   **Scalability:** The company can support 50% more sales with the same central staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:01">[03:00:01]</a>.
*   **Valuation & Performance:** MT has grown at an average of 15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:01">[03:03:01]</a> and trades at 11 times earnings, a significant discount compared to similar companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:07">[03:06:07]</a>. In the long term, its value could triple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>.

### 4. Real Estate Investment Companies (REITs)
*   **Business:** These companies invest in properties for rent, like apartment buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>.
*   **"Old Dollars" Characteristic:** They have already acquired or built their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>.
*   **Inflationary Benefits:** Rents are often contractually linked to inflation (CPI), allowing income to increase without a proportional rise in investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>. Property values also appreciate with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:14">[04:18:14]</a>.
*   **Debt Management:** Companies like this REIT protect against rising interest rates with hedges and swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:10">[03:36:10]</a>. They prefer fixed-rate debt, which benefits when inflation devalues the debt while asset values rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:28">[04:27:28]</a>.
*   **Performance:** This specific REIT has demonstrated strong growth, increasing rents on renewals by 6% (above US inflation) and new rentals by 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:46">[03:46:46]</a>. Its stock price rose from $12 to $60 since 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:29">[03:40:29]</a>.

### 5. Traditional Service Companies (e.g., Keystone Law, Lee Partners)
*   **Business:** These are professional services companies that provide essential, recurring services, often in niche markets.
    *   **Keystone Law:** A law firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>. Legal services are recurrent and less affected by crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.
    *   **Lee Partners:** Offers tax filing services and accounting for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>. All companies must do their accounting annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:08">[01:17:08]</a>.
*   **"Old Dollars" Characteristic:** These businesses do not need significant financing or capital investment to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>, as their value is built on expertise and reputation.
*   **Growth Model:** They grow organically and through acquisitions of smaller firms, integrating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.
*   **Financials:**
    *   **Keystone Law:** Revenue grew from £16 million to £55 million since 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>. Expected to reach £70 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>, with EBITDA around £10-11 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:26">[01:14:26]</a>. Trades at 30-40 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.
    *   **Lee Partners:** Revenue grew from £13 million to £50 million, and operating profit from £3 million to £14 million since 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a>. Annual growth rate of almost 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a>. Trades at around 20 times adjusted earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>.
*   **Advantages:** They are often small and less known, offering potential for significant returns when their valuation multiples expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>.

## Investment Principles for Private Investors

*   **Be Sensitive to Valuation:** Don't buy at any price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   [[understanding_companies_before_investing | Understand Companies]]: Invest in good businesses and comprehend how inflation affects them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   [[diversifying_in_undervalued_sectors | Diversification]]: Consider sectors like real estate, gold, energy, and stable consumer companies during inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>. Financial companies also tend to do well as interest rates rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>.
*   [[investment_strategies_in_small_caps_and_favorable_market_segments | Investing in Small Caps and Private Investing]]: For private investors, there's a significant advantage in [[investment_in_small_caps_and_private_investing | investing in small caps]] and special situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:59">[01:07:59]</a>. These smaller companies offer higher growth rates (e.g., 20-25% annually for Hamilton Son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>), can be less liquid, but allow for quicker entry and exit from positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>.
*   **Patience and Training:** Investing is not "easy money" and requires work, effort, and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:33">[01:08:33]</a>. Success comes from consistent effort and a genuine interest in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.
*   **Risk Management:** While volatility is normal (e.g., a fund dropping 30% in a crisis), investing in diversified, essential businesses reduces long-term risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>.
*   **Understanding vs. Copying:** Do not blindly copy investment ideas from funds without understanding the underlying business, its valuation, and how to monitor its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>. [[value_investing_and_understanding_intrinsic_value | Valuing a company]] is complex and requires a detailed process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>.

The goal is to grow assets steadily and safely, not necessarily to get rich quickly through speculative investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:04">[01:31:04]</a>.

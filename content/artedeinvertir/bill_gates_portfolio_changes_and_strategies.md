[[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates]], one of the world's wealthiest and most influential individuals, has recently made significant changes to his [[bill_gates_investment_portfolio | investment portfolio]] by selling a notable portion of his shares in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These movements, coupled with his predictions of a new economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, provide insight into his outlook on the future economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Bill Gates as an Investor
With a fortune exceeding $120 billion, [[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates]] is recognized not only as the founder of Microsoft but also as an astute investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. His assets include only 40% in Microsoft shares, with the remaining 60% diversified across a broad stock portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. His demonstrated expertise in economics and the stock market makes his recent [[analysis_of_bill_gates_portfolio_changes | portfolio changes]] and public statements particularly noteworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

[[impact_of_bill_gates_predictions_on_global_economics | Bill Gates]] has a history of prescient warnings, including predicting a global pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> and even identifying which company would first develop the vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Reasons for Recent Share Sales
In a recent Q&A session, [[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates]] stated that it is "certain that we will have a crisis similar to that of 2008 in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This vision appears to be a primary factor behind his accelerated share sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Through stock market transparency rules, professional investors with portfolios over $100 million are required to periodically disclose their holdings, including purchases and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This allows for an [[analysis_of_bill_gates_portfolio_changes | analysis of Bill Gates' portfolio changes]] and insights into his future economic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

According to the most recent report from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the investment vehicle for his assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>:
*   He has sold 11 of the 18 shares in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   He has only bought one new share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

In a February interview with CNN, [[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates]] expressed concerns that current global problems could last longer than anticipated, leading to serious economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. He specifically highlighted that the main risk for the economy is the insufficient global effort to end the pandemic, with vaccines predominantly reaching rich countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This uneven distribution increases the risk of new variants spreading and impacting economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Key Portfolio Sales
[[analysis_of_bill_gates_portfolio_changes | Bill Gates' investment activity]] reveals three significant selling patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>:

1.  **Technology Stocks**: He has begun selling all his technology stocks, including Amazon, Google, and Apple, which had been major beneficiaries of recent economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
2.  **Uber**: He sold all shares of Uber, noting its high valuation and fragility during an economic downturn, as it does not produce profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
3.  **Alibaba**: All shares in Alibaba, listed under ticker "BABA" at $225 per share, were sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Despite being an excellent company, recent problems with the Chinese regulator caused panic among investors and a sharp decline in share prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This sale likely reflects a "tail risk" assessment, where an unlikely but potentially serious event could impact the stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

These [[reasons_behind_bill_gates_selling_his_shares | reasons behind Bill Gates selling his shares]] indicate a strategy to position himself for "the great rotation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This strategy involves shifting capital from disruptive or technological companies, which have seen strong revaluations, towards more traditional and conservative companies that are currently trading at attractive valuations due to low interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. He is concentrating investments in defensive stocks more resistant to a potential economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Optimistic Investments: Defensive Stocks
[[analysis_of_bill_gates_favorite_stocks_in_biotechnology | Bill Gates' favorite stocks]] reflect a conservative and defensive investment philosophy, indicating where he remains optimistic about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>:

*   **Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)**: His largest investment, accounting for 43% of his portfolio, with over $9 billion invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Listed at $250 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, this reflects his strong confidence in Warren Buffett and the company's ability to withstand any economic environment while providing acceptable returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Its profits and book value per share are estimated to grow between 7% and 12% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Waste Management (WM)**: Represents 10% of his portfolio, an investment of over $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Listed at $115 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, this leading US waste collection and recycling company is highly resilient to crises and predictable in any economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. The recycling market is projected to grow above GDP at 9% in the coming years, particularly in North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Walmart (WMT)**: A 9% stake in the world's largest supermarket chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, listed at $135 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. It is a conservative company that performs well in any economic climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Canadian National Railway (CN)**: Listed at $115 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, this railway company is considered one of the safest investments in transportation due to the high barrier to entry for rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Railways remain cost-competitive for transporting raw materials and industrial goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Its profits are estimated to grow at 10% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

[[bill_gates_investment_portfolio | Bill Gates' investment portfolio]] also includes other high-quality "blue-chip" companies like FedEx, UPS, and Caterpillar, which are large-cap, stable companies providing adequate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## New Investment: Schrödinger
The only new stock [[bill_gates_new_investment_in_the_company_schrdinger | Bill Gates]] has recently purchased is the American company Schrödinger (SDR), in which he invested over $500 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Listed at $71 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, Schrödinger is a highly innovative company using its technological platform to help pharmaceutical companies develop new drugs and vaccines more quickly and effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This company has high growth potential, operating in the US medical research and clinical trials market valued at $47 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Despite its high valuation and current lack of profits, [[bill_gates_new_investment_in_the_company_schrdinger | Bill Gates' new investment in the company Schrdinger]] suggests a very long-term outlook, anticipating substantial returns if the company captures a significant portion of this large market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This represents an example of [[investment_opportunities_bill_gates_is_optimistic_about | investment opportunities Bill Gates is optimistic about]].

## Predictions for Economic Recovery
Contrary to popular belief that the economy might normalize by the end of 2021, [[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates]] predicts that a return to a normal state will likely occur closer to the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This more conservative view on the economic future appears to be a key driver behind the recent [[analysis_of_bill_gates_portfolio_changes | changes to Bill Gates' investment portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

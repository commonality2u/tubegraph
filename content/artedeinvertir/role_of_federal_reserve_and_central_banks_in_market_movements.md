Despite the economy experiencing significant contractions, with falls potentially reaching 9% of the gross domestic product, the stock market has paradoxically risen by over 40% in less than two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This phenomenon has surprised many prominent investors, including Warren Buffett and Stanley Druckenmiller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The question many investors are asking is how the market can continue to rise and approach historical highs amidst one of the worst economic contractions in 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Influence of the [[federal_reserves_impact_on_the_economy|Federal Reserve]] and Central Banks

A primary reason for the stock market's rise is the actions of the [[federal_reserves_impact_on_the_economy|Federal Reserve]] and [[impact_of_central_bank_policies_on_economic_conditions|central banks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
If the [[federal_reserves_position_on_market_intervention|Federal Reserve]] decides to flood the market with liquidity, the stock market is expected to rise in the short and medium term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This trend has been observed for decades and is projected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Veteran investor Stanley Druckenmiller, known for annual returns of 30% for over 30 years, acknowledged being "humiliated by the markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. He admitted to underestimating "how many red lines the [[role_of_central_banks_and_government_policies_in_inflation|central banks]] were willing to cross and how far they are determined to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Druckenmiller had previously expressed caution about the market situation, leading him to take a more careful approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. While the markets subsequently rose 40%, his portfolio only appreciated 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Contributing Factors to Market Enthusiasm

The current market enthusiasm is attributed to a combination of factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>:
*   The financial contributions from the [[federal_reserves_impact_on_the_economy|Federal Reserve]] (referred to as "FEHT money") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   Positive news surrounding the possibility of a vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   The general enthusiasm for the reopening of the economy, leading companies affected by recent issues to "come back to life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

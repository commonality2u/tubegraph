The year 2022 has seen significant volatility in the economy and [[impact_of_globalization_and_geopolitical_issues_on_the_stock_market | global stock markets]] due to several crises, with the [[transport_and_supply_chain_disruptions | transport crisis]] being one of the most prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This new economic scenario is expected to affect everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Overview of the Transport Crisis
The [[transport_and_supply_chain_disruptions | transport crisis]] is characterized by a global logistical collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Ports worldwide are literally jammed, and transport costs have soared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This has led to supply problems, with goods arriving at higher costs due to increased transport expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Producers, in turn, have had to raise their prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

The cost of transporting a typical container has multiplied by five times, from $1,500-$2,000 to over $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This directly impacts the cost of all imported or consumed products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, ultimately causing inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The head of logistics at Uber described the situation as "Armageddon" at the logistics and transportation level, noting that no clear solution is apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Causes
The primary causes of this logistical collapse include:
*   **Confinements and increased cases**: Many workers are unable to occupy their jobs due to lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Shortage of qualified workers**: There is a lack of qualified workers willing to dedicate themselves to the transport sector, a situation exacerbated by the crisis and confinements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This shortage applies not only to maritime transport but also to road and air transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The demand for road transport workers, for instance, is "through the roof" in Europe, and companies are struggling to fill positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

This worker shortage forces companies to dramatically raise wages, which further impacts the cost of products and goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Immediate Implications
The most direct implications of the [[transport_and_supply_chain_disruptions | transport crisis]] are:
*   **Inflation**: It is a serious problem that has worsened, with inflation data in the United States reaching the highest figures in 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Reduced Consumption**: As the price of goods increases, people have less disposable income, negatively affecting consumption, which accounts for 70% of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Stock Market Impact**: Reduced business profits due to higher costs are reflected in lower stock market valuations and share prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Mitigating Factors and Beneficiaries
While the [[transport_and_supply_chain_disruptions | transport crisis]] presents challenges, some companies and sectors benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. It's an old saying in the stock market that "there is always a bull market and there is always a bear market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Even in crises, certain assets or market segments can thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

In the transport sector, companies that primarily facilitate connections or manage logistics efficiently are benefiting:
*   **C.H. Robinson**: A high-quality company in the Dow Jones transport index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.
*   **Expeditors International (Periquitos International)**: This company connects transport firms with those needing transport services, profiting from the margin on transport costs. As transport costs rise, their profit margins increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.
*   **J.B. Hunt Transport Services (J.B.G.)**: Another exceptional company in the transport sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
*   **Union Pacific**: A rail transport company that offers low and predictable transport costs, performing well amidst bottlenecks and supply shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.
*   **TFI International (TFII)**: A Canadian company that grows by acquiring poorly managed small transport companies and improving their profit margins. It has significantly risen since the crisis began in 2020, going from $30 to over $100 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. This company benefits enormously from increasing transport rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

Thinking long-term is crucial, as many crises pass, and market volatility is inherent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. It is important not to panic and make poor decisions during periods of temporary losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

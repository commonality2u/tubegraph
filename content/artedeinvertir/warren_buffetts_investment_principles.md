[[Warren Buffett's investment advice | Warren Buffett]], considered the greatest investor of all time, has achieved tremendous success in the world of investments, turning an initial $1,000 investment into over $34 million today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. During a university lecture, he revealed seven basic principles that guided his investment approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These principles are especially valuable for beginners or those with limited capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## 1. Invest in Good Companies, Avoid Mediocre Businesses

[[Warren Buffett's investment tips | Warren Buffett's first investment advice]] for beginners is to invest in good companies and avoid mediocre businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. He emphasizes that buying cheap stocks of low-quality businesses is generally a bad idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. While such stocks might offer quick gains of 30-40%, they don't generate long-term value and prevent investors from benefiting from the compound capitalization effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Conversely, investing in exceptional businesses that generate significant long-term value, even if they have a slightly higher valuation, offers two main advantages:
*   The analytical work is done once, and returns can theoretically be reaped for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   Investors benefit tremendously from the compound capitalization effect, as these shares can multiply by 8, 10, 20, or even 50 times in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

**Examples:**
*   **Mediocre Business:** General Motors' stock price has shown little long-term growth over the last 10 years, despite occasional short-term rallies of 30-40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Relying on such stocks for a portfolio often leads to mediocre long-term performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Exceptional Business:** Moody's (ticker: MC) has multiplied by over 10 times in the stock market over the last 10 years, demonstrating its status as an extraordinary company that generates long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

**Identifying Good Businesses:**
There are two main methods for identifying good businesses:
1.  **Fundamental Analysis:** Study the company's fundamentals, including its operations, profit and loss account, and balance sheet. Focus on consistent growth in earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
2.  **Stock Market Performance:** For beginners, observing a stock's historical performance can be a good indicator. If a company's stock has not multiplied several times over 10 to 20 years, it might not be a good business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This should be followed by a valuation assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## 2. Understand Companies Before Investing

[[Warren Buffett's investment strategies | Warren Buffett]] emphasizes the necessity of understanding companies before investing in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This understanding goes beyond knowing products or services; it means having certainty that the company will generate profits in ten years, and those profits will be greater than current levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

A key secret to [[Warren Buffett's investment strategies and insights | Warren Buffett's long-term success]] is avoiding investments in very new or rapidly changing sectors, as he finds it difficult to analyze their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

**Examples:**
*   **Understandable Business:** McDonald's (ticker: MCD) is a favorite investment of [[Warren Buffett's current investment moves | Warren Buffett]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. He explains that technological changes like the internet won't stop people from eating hamburgers or drinking Coca-Cola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. McDonald's business model is easy to understand, has few risks, and is expected to generate increasing long-term profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Its shares have multiplied by over three times in the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Difficult-to-Understand/Changing Sector:** Intel operates in a rapidly changing sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Despite previous perceptions, competition has radically altered Intel's profit and revenue outlook, leading to poor stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. [[Warren Buffett's 2021 investment portfolio | Warren Buffett]] has historically avoided investing in such companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## 3. Maximize Opportunities (Act Decisively)

When a good investment opportunity is identified and understood, [[Warren Buffett's investment strategy for small capital | Warren Buffett]] advises not to be afraid to take a high position in that business within one's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This decisive action has been a key factor in his tremendous long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

[[Warren Buffett's latest investment moves | Warren Buffett's portfolio]] often reflects this conviction, with his top five positions historically representing over 50% of his total portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

**Examples:**
*   **Apple (ticker: AAPL):** Apple shares represent an impressive 47% of [[Warren Buffett's 2021 investment portfolio | Warren Buffett's portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. In 2016, when he saw the opportunity, he invested over $15 billion, leading to the shares multiplying by more than six times and generating nearly $100 trillion in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Coca-Cola:** When [[investor advice and insights from Warren Buffett | Warren Buffett]] identified Coca-Cola as a good investment, he invested decisively, and the shares have since multiplied by over 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **American Express:** Early in his career, he allocated 20% of his portfolio to American Express, which has since multiplied by over 200 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

[[Warren Buffett's investment advice | Warren Buffett]] also advises against feeling bad for missing opportunities that one cannot understand or analyze (e.g., Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Instead, patiently wait for understandable ideas and act decisively on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. However, he acknowledges regret for missing investments like Netflix, which he could understand and analyze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## 4. Don't Sell Unless the Business Fundamentally Changes

[[Warren Buffett's investment principles | Warren Buffett's fourth piece of advice]] is not to sell shares unless the business has changed at a fundamental level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Extraordinary stocks often experience periods of 30% or even 50% drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. During these moments of panic, he recommends ignoring the market price and focusing on whether the company's ability to generate profits or its competitive position has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. If fundamentals are unchanged, the logical action is to do nothing or increase the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

Conversely, [[Warren Buffett's investment advice | Warren Buffett]] also recommends selling shares decisively when new risks emerge or the business fundamentally changes, even if the shares have not yet fallen in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

**Examples:**
*   **Tesla (ticker: TSLA):** Tesla shares multiplied by over 90 times in the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. During this period, they experienced eight stock market corrections with drops over 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. An investor who panicked and sold during these drops would have missed out on long-term returns because the business itself had not fundamentally changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **IBM:** [[Warren Buffett's latest investment moves | Warren Buffett]] recently sold his entire stake in IBM despite its lateral market behavior, indicating a fundamental change in his assessment of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Stryker (ticker: SYK):** Stryker, a leading medical equipment manufacturer, operates in a stable sector with tailwinds from an aging population, allowing for estimated increasing and stable profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Its past growth from $5 to $60 saw ten occasions where shares fell over 20%, but the business continued to generate value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## 5. Invest Using Facts, Not Emotions

This is arguably one of [[Warren Buffett's investment strategies | Warren Buffett's best tips]], as emotional decision-making is a primary reason many investors fail in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

[[Warren Buffett's investment advice | Warren Buffett]] stated:
> "Investors get very excited during bull markets. They look in the rearview mirror and say I made a lot of money last year and I want to make more money this year and that's why they keep buying and buying those stocks that keep going up in the stock market however if a stock has not gone up during a bull market people think that it is not a good business and they do not bother to analyze those stocks and this creates giant opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

This phenomenon creates tremendous opportunities, especially during bull markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

**Example:**
*   **Disney (ticker: DIS):** For five years, Disney's stock performed sideways while the broader market rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. However, in recent months, it more than doubled, despite being the same business with the same assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This illustrates the "giant opportunities" that arise when people ignore stocks not performing well during bull markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

## 6. Invest in Companies with Talented and Integral Managers

It's crucial to remember that behind every share is a business run by people, and their talent and integrity fundamentally impact the business's future and stock market evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

[[Warren Buffett's investment strategies | Warren Buffett]] also recommends investing in companies where management holds a significant number of company shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This ensures their interests are aligned with other shareholders, like us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Ideally, the value of their shares should be ten times higher than their salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Websites like Morningstar.com or MarketScreener.com can help check management's shareholdings and salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

**Example:**
*   **Amazon (ticker: AMZN):** [[Warren Buffett's latest investment moves | Warren Buffett]] made a recent investment in Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, is known for his enormous business talent and for treating shareholders with integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

## 7. Buy Shares Below Their Intrinsic Value

Perhaps the most important principle for investing, according to [[Warren Buffett's investment advice | Warren Buffett]], is to always buy shares below their intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Intrinsic value is a subjective value calculated by the investor before investing, derived through a stock valuation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. To determine this, one must make a conservative estimate of future profits and apply various valuation methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

**Example:**
*   **Coca-Cola:** As shown in a graph from Giverny Capital, when Coca-Cola's market price (red line) was above its intrinsic value (blue line), such as in 2003 and 2004, it was not a good time to invest, and the shares subsequently dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. Conversely, when the market price was below the intrinsic value, as in 2009 or 2012, subsequent stock market performance was good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

Valuing shares is a simple process that requires learning, but it is essential for informed investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

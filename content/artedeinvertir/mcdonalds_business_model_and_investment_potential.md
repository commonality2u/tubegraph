McDonald's is recognized as a highly successful company in the investment world, with its shares having multiplied by over 1,000 times since going public more than 40 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. A small investment of $1,000 would now be worth over $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. Ray Dalio, one of the world's largest and most successful investment fund managers, recently invested in McDonald's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:33">[06:07:33]</a>.

## Business Model: Real Estate at its Core
While commonly perceived as a fast-food business, McDonald's primarily operates as a real estate business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

### Franchise and Real Estate Strategy
McDonald's does not directly operate most of its restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. Instead, its restaurants are run by franchisees who pay McDonald's a commission or royalty on each sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. This franchising model is highly lucrative due to low investment requirements and high margins for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

The company's significant innovation was to own the land and buildings where these restaurants are located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. This strategy provides several advantages:
*   **Rent Increases**: McDonald's can periodically raise rents for franchisees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Control**: It provides more control over franchisees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
*   **Asset Appreciation**: The land and buildings appreciate in value over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage**: The purchase of real estate assets can be financed with low-cost debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

### Revenue Breakdown
In a recent year, McDonald's income from its franchisees exceeded $11 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. The majority of this, $7.5 billion, came from renting real estate properties to franchisees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. The royalties paid for food and drink sales constitute the smaller portion of their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. This structure makes McDonald's a prime example of [[predictable_businesses_in_investment | predictable businesses]].

## Resilience and Growth
McDonald's is considered a resilient business model that performs well in any economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

### Performance in Crises
During difficult years like 2008, McDonald's reported positive results and its shares only fell 20% on the stock market, while the general market declined by up to 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>, showcasing its strength as an [[analysis_of_anticrisis_investment_opportunities | anticrisis investment opportunity]]. The company is minimally affected by crises because over 70% of its income derives from rents paid by franchisees, which must be paid regardless of whether restaurants are open or closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

### Adapting to Current Challenges
While the variable part of royalties from food sales was affected by restaurant closures, McDonald's adapted well with its pick-up and delivery services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. Sales for the current year are only estimated to drop by 12% and are projected to rebound by over 15% the following year, allowing for quick recovery of profitability and earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

### Future Growth
Despite being a mature company present in most countries, McDonald's current growth is driven by emerging nations with increasing middle classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. The company can grow its earnings per share in the future by 7% to 12% per year through new restaurant openings, price increases, and share buyback programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

## Valuation and Investment Potential
McDonald's shares rarely trade cheaply on the stock market due to the recognized quality of its business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

Currently, shares trade at a forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 22 times future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. With projected earnings per share growth of 7% to 12% annually, the company's 5-year target price is estimated between $250 and $320 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. This represents an attractive potential for a high-quality company that also pays a significant dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

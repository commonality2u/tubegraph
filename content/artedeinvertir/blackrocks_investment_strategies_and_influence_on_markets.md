BlackRock is a company often described as the "owner of the world" due to its immense financial power and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It controls over 10 trillion dollars in assets, making it the largest shareholder in major listed companies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. To put its size into perspective, its controlled assets represent more than 10% of the world economy, exceeding the GDP of all countries except China and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Many sources accuse BlackRock of contributing to environmental damage, social inequality, or financial fraud due to its significant power and control over companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It is highly probable that a portion of individual savings has been directly or indirectly funneled into BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Leadership and Business Model

BlackRock is led by Larry Fink, its enigmatic CEO, who is considered one of the most economically powerful individuals globally, yet remains largely unknown to the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Like any private company, BlackRock's primary objective is to generate profits from the funds provided by its investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The company's main source of income (80%) comes from advising on financial products, particularly its iShares ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. BlackRock innovated by creating these Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) which are bought and sold as easily as stocks, establishing a new category for the general public to easily [[Investment strategies and advice | invest]] in the entire market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Clients and Funding Sources

BlackRock's clientele, which provides it with such immense purchasing power, primarily consists of banks, insurers, pension plans, and sovereign funds from some of the world's richest countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Crucially, a significant portion of its clients are small investors, similar to average individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

It's very likely that if you have an [[Investment strategies and advice | investment plan]] offered by a bank, your money has ended up in BlackRock products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Even money deposited in a bank without direct [[Investment strategies and advice | investment]] can be invested by the bank for its own benefit, and it's probable some of that money also finds its way into BlackRock products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## [[BlackRocks influence on the global economy | Influence on the Financial Sector]]

BlackRock effectively [[BlackRocks control over listed companies and banks | controls the financial sector]], which is considered the "lung of the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. With its vast funds, it holds majority positions in leading global banks, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Banco Santander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Paradoxically, many of these banks are also BlackRock's main clients, continuously providing it with more money, thereby increasing its controlling position over the world's major companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

For instance, the main ETF funds owning Banco Santander shares are all from "iShares," the commercial name BlackRock uses for its investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Similarly, BlackRock appears among the main shareholders of large American banks like JP Morgan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This pattern extends to popular retail [[Investment strategies and advice | investments]] offered by banks; for example, Santander's "My Project 2025" fund includes iShares products among its main [[Investment strategies and advice | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Circular Structure
> This creates a curious circular structure: the company that owns a bank and controls its board ends up receiving more money from the bank's own clients. In turn, BlackRock uses this money to buy more shares of that bank, increasing its ownership and power over these financial entities, thus boosting its profits and global influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

BlackRock also possesses a controversial division called "BlackRock Solutions," which audits and controls potential risks that major global banks might pose to the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This division grants BlackRock access to the intimate internal accounts and data of these banks, even though BlackRock is simultaneously a main investor in these same banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. BlackRock maintains that these are separate entities with "Chinese walls" for information control, though this claim is met with skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

The [[Impact of BlackRock on financial systems | power of BlackRock]] within the financial system is so significant that the Federal Reserve commissioned it to dismantle failed banks like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns during the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. BlackRock's influence extends beyond rich economies like the U.S. and Europe, as it is also a primary lender to emerging countries, further solidifying its control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Broader Market and Sectoral [[BlackRocks influence on the global economy | Influence]]

BlackRock's ETFs, particularly the iShares Core S&P 500 (ticker IVV), are among the most traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, with a daily volume exceeding 2 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

In the United States, an estimated 60% of [[Investment strategies and advice | invested]] money is now passive, often in products like BlackRock's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This trend concentrates power in very few companies that end up controlling the main listed companies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

BlackRock's presence spans various sectors. For example, while BlackRock may not be a main shareholder in McDonald's, it is a main shareholder in McDonald's competitor, Wendy's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:07:11]</a>. This pattern of the same company controlling multiple leading businesses within a single sector raises questions about competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This issue is observed in the automotive, airline, and financial sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

According to a CNN report, BlackRock and Vanguard together control over 15 trillion dollars in assets, comparable to the U.S. economy (23 trillion dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:08:10]</a>. These two firms are the primary shareholders in 85% of the world's major listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

BlackRock also exercises [[BlackRocks influence on the global economy | its power]] in the media sector, which is crucial for shaping public opinion. It is estimated that they control 95% of traditional and new-generation media (like Facebook), appearing as major shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:35]</a>.

In 2021, driven by public pressure, BlackRock leveraged [[BlackRocks control over listed companies and banks | its power]] over companies it controls, such as ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest oil companies, to reduce CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:51]</a>. ExxonMobil subsequently committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:54]</a>.

## Investment Strategy: Passive Investing and ETFs (iShares)

BlackRock has been a key driver of passive [[Market dynamics and investment strategies | investment]], particularly through its iShares ETFs. These products allow the general public to [[Investment strategies and advice | invest]] in broad market indices with ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:58]</a>. This strategy involves buying all companies listed on the stock market through ETFs or passive funds, simplifying [[Investment strategies and advice | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:04]</a>.

## Concerns and Criticisms

### [[Ethical and competitive concerns related to BlackRocks power | Conflicts of Interest and Competition]]
The concentration of voting rights in BlackRock due to its passive [[Investment strategies and advice | investment]] products means that power is consolidated in very few companies that control major global firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:24]</a>. This accumulation of power also generates potential conflicts of interest at the level of competition between different companies controlled by a single entity like BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:52]</a>. Many sources question the freedom of competition in sectors where the same owner controls major players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:25]</a>.

### The "Passive Investment Bubble"
Large investors like Michael Burry, who famously predicted the 2008 financial crisis (as depicted in "The Big Short"), have warned that passive [[Investment strategies and advice | investing]] and ETFs represent a "huge bubble" due to the high valuations many companies are reaching, regardless of their quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:22]</a>.

The mechanism of these ETFs forces automated purchasing systems to buy more shares of a stock as it rises and gains a greater relative weight within an index, further inflating its valuation and attracting more passive [[Investment strategies and advice | investment]] capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:41]</a>. Burry has cautioned that this "music will stop playing" when capital outflows exceed inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:09]</a>. He likens it to a game of musical chairs, where the longer it's played, the higher the risk of ending up without a chair and losing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:23]</a>.

## BlackRock's Financial Performance as an Investment

BlackRock (BLK) is itself listed on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:06]</a>. Since its listing in 2000, BlackRock shares have multiplied by over 50 times, making many shareholders wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:22]</a>. The trend of passive [[Market dynamics and investment strategies | investment]] is expected to continue, allowing BlackRock to capitalize on future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:28]</a>. The company projects to grow at 15% annually until 2025, a rate significantly higher than the average for listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:47]</a>.

BlackRock treats its shareholders well, having returned over 75% of its earnings in the form of dividends or share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. It has consistently increased its dividends by 18% per year, mirroring its annual stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Impact of Inflation
Inflation could have a neutral or even positive effect on BlackRock's results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:25]</a>. BlackRock charges a percentage on the value of its listed ETFs. If the value of these ETFs increases due to inflation, its commission will be higher, while its costs will not increase proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:39]</a>. In environments with high inflation, the nominal value of financial assets tends to increase, leading to higher commissions for BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:11:05]</a>.

BlackRock's current valuation is around 23 times earnings, slightly higher than its historical average of 18 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:12]</a>. As the company becomes more widely known, people are willing to pay a slightly higher price for this "very high quality company with above-average growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:22]</a>.

## Protecting Investments and Future Trends

Investors are advised to take full responsibility for their [[Investment strategies and advice | investments]], understanding where their money is invested, the commissions paid, and the expected risks and returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:47]</a>. It is crucial to be aware of the individuals or companies managing your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:51]</a>.

Despite the complexity of the financial system, continuous education and training are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:57]</a>. While passive [[Investment strategies and advice | investment]] aims to simplify [[Investment strategies and advice | investing]], it potentially creates a "financial non-bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:12:07]</a>.

In the future, individual stock selection is expected to gain greater importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:46]</a>. In a market where the majority blindly buys all shares regardless of valuation, there will be opportunities to find undervalued companies not part of major indices, while overvalued companies will likely underperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:13:01]</a>.

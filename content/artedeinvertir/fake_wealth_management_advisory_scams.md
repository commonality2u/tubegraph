The world of stock market investments has seen a rise in sophisticated scams due to increased popularity, attracting unscrupulous individuals seeking other people's money through complex deception techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It is crucial to understand these techniques to avoid them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## How the Scam Works

Fake wealth management advisory companies are a popular scam method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. They typically initiate contact by phone using high-pressure sales techniques, often employing women with pleasant voices to target a male audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### Initial Contact and Trust Building
The initial call is usually friendly, with scammers presenting themselves as a reliable company holding the necessary permits to manage capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. If potential victims are skeptical, the scammers will offer to open an account in their name and deposit their own money, for example, 20,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. They then begin operating with this money to demonstrate their "method," assuring the victim that if they lose it, no harm is done as it's the scammer's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. They even provide passwords for the victim to access an online platform and monitor investments and capital growth in real time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. These "extracts" and platform interfaces are often falsified, as seen in examples from the Invertia website that echoed this scam, including a platform associated with a colluding broker named Red Forex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### The Bait
The deposited 20,000 euros will magically grow to a larger sum, such as 50,000 euros, often within days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The victim can view a history of operations that supposedly led to this increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### The Second Call and Deception
A second call then proposes that the victim deposit 20,000 euros into the account, allowing the scammers to withdraw their initial capital and grant the victim control of the now 50,000 euro account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Many victims fall for this due to greed, believing they are gaining control of a significantly larger sum that continues to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

### What Happens Next
Several scenarios can unfold after the victim deposits money:
*   **Disappearance**: The scammers cease communication and disappear, leaving the victim with no way to retrieve their funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Increased Loss**: The victim's greed may lead them to deposit even more money, resulting in greater financial loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Collusion with Brokers**: Sophisticated organizations often collude with low-reputation brokers. The victim's deposited money is then moved through numerous operations, generating high commissions that ultimately go to the scamming organization and the colluding broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Derivatives Trading**: They may also operate with derivatives where the broker is the counterparty, meaning any losses incurred by the unsuspecting victim directly benefit the broker or organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## Preventing Scams
Avoid falling for scams by not letting greed override caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Remember that no one will offer something for nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

### Key Red Flags
*   **Promises of High Returns Without Risk**: Be wary of anyone promising high returns on the stock market without risk, as such a thing simply does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Requirement to Attract New People**: If increasing returns requires attracting new people to a "business opportunity," your distrust should be even greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Legitimate Investment Companies
If seeking a company to invest your money, look for entities regulated by the highest stock market authority in your country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. For example, Tribal Investment in Spain holds a license from the CNMV, the highest regulator at the stock market and investment level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that thousands of people are being scammed daily in the markets, and sharing this information can help prevent it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Learning about the stock market and [[Stock investment advice | investments]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.# Fake Wealth Management Advisory Scams

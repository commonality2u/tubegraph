This article explores various [[stock_market_analysis_and_investment_opportunities | investment opportunities]] and specific stock analyses, focusing on the views of legendary investor Jean Chinos, known for generating annual returns over 20% by investing against the market and individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Jean Chinos: A Legendary Investor

Jean Chinos is regarded as one of Wall Street's most astute investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. He has consistently generated an annual return exceeding 22% for over 35 years for himself and his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. An initial investment of $10,000 at the start of his career would have grown to over $1.2 million, significantly outperforming the general stock market, where the same investment would have only reached $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Chinos manages over $7 billion for clients, and his personal fortune is estimated at over $1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Understanding Short Selling

Jean Chinos is primarily a "short seller" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This investment strategy allows investors to profit when the stock market or a specific stock declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The process involves borrowing shares from a broker and selling them in the market, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price to return to the broker, thereby making a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Shorting a stock is considered much riskier than "going long" (buying with the hope of an increase) and is not recommended for beginner investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The main reasons for this include:
*   **Limited Profit, Unlimited Loss**: Potential profit is limited to 100% (if the stock falls to zero), but potential loss is unlimited as a stock's price can theoretically rise indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Conversely, going long offers limited loss (the invested amount) but unlimited potential gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Costs**: If the shorted stock pays dividends, the short seller must pay these dividends back to the lender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Brokers also charge annual interest for lending the shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. These costs mean that time works against the short seller, as longer positions incur higher maintenance costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Chinos' Track Record of Successful Short Positions

Jean Chinos has a notable track record of successful shorting operations:
*   He was short on Wirecard shares months before its bankruptcy, making over $100 million from the operation, which was the biggest stock fraud in German history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   He was also short on King Coffee shares, a significant stock scam in China, which saw its shares fall over 90% when uncovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   One of his most successful operations was the fall of Enron, the largest case of stock fraud in US history, where he earned over $500 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Bearish Market Outlook

Jean Chinos recently stated that the market offers one of the best bearish opportunities of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. He holds a skeptical view on the market due to two main reasons:
1.  **Skepticism about Future Profits**: He is skeptical about stock profits in 2021 and would be surprised if they return to 2019 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Chinos believes that long-term stock movements are driven by company profitability; thus, if 2021 profits do not rebound to 2019 levels, recent stock market increases may be ephemeral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
2.  **New Debt Issuance**: He is concerned about the new debt issuance by central banks worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. He argues that this "economic experiment" has only benefited a small portion of society owning financial assets like stocks, while the majority will have to bear the cost of this new debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Chinos anticipates new regulations or increased taxes as a consequence, which would negatively impact company profitability and, consequently, the stock market's future behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Analysis of Bearish Investments

Chinos has focused his bearish investments on some of the market's most popular stocks. This section provides an [[analysis_of_bearish_investments_in_tesla | analysis of bearish investments in Tesla]] and other companies.

### Tesla (TSLA)

Tesla shares (TSLA) represent one of Chinos' primary short positions, listed at a price of $1,500 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Tesla is a highly popular stock and was the most traded stock in many European countries in February 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

Chinos' reasons for shorting Tesla include:
*   **Unprofitability and Debt**: He states that Tesla is not a profitable company and carries a lot of debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Accounting Practices**: Chinos claims Tesla manipulates its results through aggressive accounting practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Non-existent Technology**: He asserts that Tesla sells autonomous driving technology that does not yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Tax Credits**: Excluding tax credits obtained from governments, Tesla's accounts would show a negative result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Increasing Competition and Stagnant Sales**: Chinos notes increasing competition in Tesla's markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Tesla's sales have been stagnant for nearly two years around 90,000 units per quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. While Model 3 sales grew significantly, sales of older Model S and X models fell sharply by 45% year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that Chinos' views are his opinion, and while Tesla is a good company leading the electric car transition, it faces significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Due to its complexity, it requires extensive study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Investors are advised to only invest in what they understand and have confidence in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Uber (UBER)

Uber (UBER) is another stock Jean Chinos has shorted, listed at $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The main risks cited by Chinos for Uber shares are:
*   **New Regulations**: Regulations aimed at preventing the company from taking advantage of low-cost companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Low Profitability**: Despite significant sales growth over the last five years, Uber's losses have grown exponentially, reaching over $8 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The market currently values Uber at over $55 billion, even without clear prospects for profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Chinos has also shorted shares of food delivery companies like Grubhub and Just Eat for similar reasons, citing new regulations and low profitability of their business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. These [[short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | short positions on Tesla and Amazon]] are part of his broader strategy.

### AstraZeneca (AZN)

AstraZeneca (AZN), listed in the US under ticker AZN at $55 per share, is discussed as a potential investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Leading in Health Solutions**: AstraZeneca is at the forefront of finding solutions to current global health problems, with a solution hoped to be ready by Fall 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Their solution, developed with Oxford University, is in Phase 3, with success rates typically over 80% at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Market Leadership**: AstraZeneca is a global leader in oncology, cardiovascular, and respiratory medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Thanks to recent discoveries, the company has transitioned from decline to annual growth rates above 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: In the first quarter, AstraZeneca grew over 15%, with profits exceeding $1 per share, giving an annualized figure of $4 in earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Biotech shares like AstraZeneca with growth potential should be listed at least 25 times their earnings (P/E ratio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This suggests a target price of $100 per share ($4 EPS * 25 P/E) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, offering an interesting potential return for a company unaffected by current problems and with good long-term prospects, currently trading at $55 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. In the next 3-5 years, the company is expected to earn nearly $7 in EPS, potentially leading to a value of over $150 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### ETF (MT)

Jean Chinos has also invested in an ETF listed under the ticker MT, at $138 per share, dedicating 30% of his portfolio to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This ETF is composed of large-cap and high-quality companies such as Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Paradoxically, this ETF also contains Tesla shares, which Chinos has famously shorted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Estimating its value is complex, but given its components, it is expected to provide a satisfactory return in the future, likely less than 15% per year due to the large size of these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

### Virgin Galactic (SPCE)

Virgin Galactic (SPCE), listed at $22 per share, is an ambitious project by Richard Branson aiming to become the first space tourism company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Initially, it plans to offer suborbital flights for a few minutes of weightlessness, with the future ambition of full space flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   **Market Potential vs. Price**: While the potential market is vast, the company intends to charge over $250,000 for this limited suborbital experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Financials**: Virgin Galactic has been accepting reservations since 2004 but currently has no income and loses over $200 million per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. In 2014, the company faced issues with an experimental flight, halting the program and investing heavily in security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
*   **Funding Challenges**: The company relies on keeping its share price high to issue new shares and finance growth, as traditional banks do not finance companies with no income and large losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Customer deposits (reservations) grew only marginally from $80 million in 2019 to $83 million in 2020, a very low growth compared to its over $5 billion market valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Liquidity and Dilution Risk**: The company has about $400 million in liquidity but an annual cash outflow of $250 million, providing liquidity for about a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. To fund future growth, it would need to issue new shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. A 10% new share issuance at the current price would raise $500 million, extending its project development by two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. However, if the share price dropped to $5, the company would need to issue four times more shares (40% dilution) to raise the same $500 million, which would be catastrophic for future share price and revaluation potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. These types of shares are highly speculative due to no income, high losses, and constant reliance on issuing new shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

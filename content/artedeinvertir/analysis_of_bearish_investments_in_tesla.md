## Michael Barry's Bearish Bet Against Tesla

Investor Michael Barry, known for his macroeconomic bets, has made a significant bearish investment against Tesla, amounting to approximately $500 million, representing 40% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:52">[01:29:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. This position is considered massive given his estimated personal assets of around $300 million after his successful 2007-2008 "big bet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This [[short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | bearish investment]] is structured through put options, which allow for a leveraged bet with limited risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

Barry's rationale for this [[investment strategies for a bear market | bearish strategy]] stems from his view that the entire automobile industry was "winning" $100 million, and even if Tesla achieved 10% to 20% of those profits, it would not justify a valuation above $20 or $30 trillion, which is almost 95% less than its current capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. He believes that Tesla's upside, dependent on software development and autonomous car technology, will also be achieved by other manufacturers like Waymo (Google) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

### Mechanism of the Bet: Put Options
Michael Barry structured this [[analyzing_stock_market_investments | investment]] through put options. Put options are used when an investor has a bearish vision on an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. This strategy allows him to gain substantially if the asset price falls, while his maximum potential loss is limited to the premium paid for the options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This creates an asymmetric investment profile where one can lose a little but potentially win a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

For his Tesla [[short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | short position]], Barry specifically considered January 2023 put option contracts, with the $400 strike price being notable due to a massive open interest of 16,000 contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. Each contract represents 100 Tesla shares, meaning he controls approximately 1.6 million Tesla shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

At the time of discussion, Tesla was trading at $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. If Tesla's price drops to $150, for example, the put option with a $400 strike price would yield a profit of $250 per share ($400 - $150) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. If these options were bought at $65, they could multiply his money by four times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

Barry's use of options for this [[investing_in_bear_markets | bearish bet]] is considered intelligent because it limits potential losses, unlike traditional short selling where losses can be unlimited if the stock rises significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This strategy allows him to be wrong multiple times and still profit immensely if he is eventually proven right, similar to his "Big Short" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

### Risk and Volatility in Tesla Investments
Tesla is recognized as a very volatile stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. The cost of options for such a stock is high because of its volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. While the asymmetric nature of options limits loss, the high volatility means the bet might not be "so asymmetric" for Tesla as compared to other positions, and the options have a longer term (one and a half years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Despite the potential for significant profits, these investments carry inherent risks due to their leveraged nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

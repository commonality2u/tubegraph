[[Investment strategies in uncertain markets | Investing]] in predictable businesses is a key strategy, particularly during periods of market uncertainty. This approach emphasizes stability and consistent performance, aiming to reduce volatility and provide more reliable returns for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Rationale for Predictable Businesses

Bill Ackman, a renowned investor, advocates for [[Investing in exceptional businesses | investing in businesses]] that exhibit a high degree of predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. His reasoning is rooted in several factors:

*   **Resilience in Crises** Predictable businesses generally do not suffer significantly during economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. This is because their products or services often remain in demand regardless of broader economic conditions.
*   **Ability to Combat Inflation** Such businesses should have the capability to raise prices to offset inflationary pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
*   **Investor Psychology** [[Characteristics of resilient and predictable businesses | Predictable pathways]] for a company's performance help mitigate investor nervousness caused by market volatility, leading to fewer mistakes from novice investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Confidence** Bill Ackman believes that aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed, though potentially causing short-term recession, would instill confidence that inflation will not become entrenched, thus leading to long-term economic prosperity and a favorable environment for stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a>. This contrasts with common market sentiment that higher rates are inherently bad for stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.

### Market Context and Bill Ackman's View

Bill Ackman has expressed concerns about a significant market collapse unless decisive actions are taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. He emphasizes that if the Fed does not act aggressively, the market itself will force a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. He believes that if the Fed acts decisively to combat inflation, the market will gain confidence and [[Investment opportunities in uncertain times | explode upwards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

Historically, low interest rates favor long-duration assets like stocks because their value is tied to discounted future cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>. While stock prices typically fall at the beginning of interest rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>, Bill Ackman argues that if the Fed quickly [[Analysis of investment opportunities in volatile markets | nips inflation]] at the root, the stock market will benefit in the long term by avoiding structural hyperinflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## Identifying Predictable Businesses

[[Characteristics of resilient and predictable businesses | Predictability]] in the stock market can be equated with "linearity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. A study found that companies with high linearity tend to double their value (over 100% return) in five years, averaging a 15% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. This performance is generally due to strong underlying business fundamentals rather than luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

Key characteristics to look for include:
*   **Low Indebtedness** Avoiding companies with high debt, especially at variable rates, is crucial in uncertain environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:42">[02:22:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:53">[02:22:53]</a>.
*   **Non-Cyclical Nature** Companies that are less affected by economic cycles or rising interest rates are preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:41">[02:22:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:57">[02:22:57]</a>.

Many people are questioning if a new economic crisis could emerge in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. One of the main risks identified is the issue of [[rising_interest_rates_and_their_influence_on_investments | rising interest rates]] and [[impact_of_inflation_and_interest_rates_on_the_economy | inflation]], signaling the potential end of easy money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## The End of Easy Money and Rising Interest Rates

The Federal Reserve has recently shifted its stance, acknowledging that [[inflation_and_interest_rates_impact | inflation]] could be a permanent phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This directly impacts interest rates, which, in turn, affect nearly everyone in the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Interest rates are currently at historical lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. When rates are at their lowest point, the only possible direction is up, especially with rising [[us_and_eurozone_inflation_and_interest_rate_dynamics | inflation]] expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Both the US and Europe have seen interest rates at 0%, while the historical average has been 4% to 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Economic Impact

A rise in interest rates would reduce the disposable income of consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Given that consumption accounts for 70% of the economy, this would negatively affect business profits, leading to a potential decline in stock prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

The Fed has also begun discussing an accelerated reduction of quantitative easing (money printing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Historically, accelerated reductions like the one seen in 2018 have been followed by an increase in interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. News outlets have even predicted the first interest rate hike as early as July 2022, a significant acceleration from the initial plan for 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

There is a high correlation between the assets of central banks and the S&P 500, a key global stock market index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Easy money policies, characterized by low interest rates and increased money circulation, encourage market growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For instance, in response to the 2020 crisis, central banks printed a record amount of money, which was reflected in the stock market's recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Implications of Rising Rates

*   **Increased Debt Costs**: A large portion of society, including those with variable-rate mortgages, would face higher debt costs, negatively impacting consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Stock Market Valuation Adjustment**: Stock market valuations are tied to risk-free assets like the 10-year American or German bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. If the profitability of these bonds rises due to increased interest rates, stock valuations would need to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Impact on Bonds and Fixed Income**: While often perceived as safe, bonds and fixed-income investments are negatively affected by inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. [[role_of_interest_rates_and_inflation_in_investments | Inflation]] reduces the purchasing power of money, and longer-duration fixed-income assets experience greater valuation adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Inflation as a Major Risk

Beyond [[influence_of_inflation_and_interest_rates_on_markets | rising interest rates]], [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] itself poses a significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### Current Inflationary Environment

Food prices have reached a 10-year high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Historically, sharp increases in food prices have led to internal rebellions and conflicts, such as the Arab Spring events in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. While not directly affecting major economies' consumption, it creates tensions and reacts to headlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### Broader Economic Impact of Inflation

If people have less disposable income due to higher costs for essentials like electricity, they will consume less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This scenario has caused severe crises, with the S&P 500 falling by nearly 40% between 1973 and 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Sustained high [[navigating_inflation_and_interest_rate_hikes_in_investing | inflation]] is considered a high risk (8 out of 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

Current inflation drivers are primarily energy, transportation costs, microchip shortages, and supply chain bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

### Implications of Inflation

*   **Erosion of Purchasing Power**: Liquidity and fixed-income bonds are significantly affected by the loss of purchasing power due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   **Stock Market Adjustments**: Similar to rising interest rates, inflation necessitates an adjustment in stock market valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Currency Depreciation**: Currencies of less solid countries (beyond the dollar, euro, yen) are vulnerable to free fall during inflationary periods, as seen with the Turkish Lira <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

### Mitigation Strategies for Investors

To mitigate the risks of rising interest rates and inflation:

*   **Review Fixed-Rate Debts**: Ideally, debts should be fixed-rate for the longest possible term at a low interest rate to avoid impact when rates rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Monitor Valuations**: In a dangerous environment of rising interest rates, it's crucial not to buy assets at any price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Stocks trading at high multiples of earnings or with no earnings carry significant risk, especially as easy money speculation subsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Investing in Quality Companies**: Investing in well-managed, debt-free companies with reasonable valuations tends to yield satisfactory long-term results in a diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Invest in Businesses with Pricing Power**: Good companies that can maintain high returns on invested capital, boast high profit margins, are non-cyclical, and have the ability to raise prices to offset rising costs tend to perform well during inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Consider Specific Sectors**: Energy, raw materials, and real estate investments often do well during inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. However, these sectors can be of lower quality and more volatile if inflation doesn't materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.
*   **Focus on Less Capital-Intensive Businesses**: Companies that don't require significant annual investment in factories or robots (e.g., Google) are generally better positioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Their costs may not rise as quickly as their ability to raise prices for essential services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Examples of resilient businesses include those providing essential services like telecommunications (e.g., Charter Communications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, or consumer staples (e.g., Procter & Gamble) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. In contrast, cyclical sectors like car manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>, airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, and house builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a> may struggle as consumers can delay discretionary purchases.
*   **Avoid Euphoria and Speculation**: Do not invest in assets driven by euphoria or extreme speculation, as parabolic movements in the stock market typically do not resolve laterally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

Understanding these risks and applying common sense investment principles, such as focusing on quality companies with reasonable valuations and thinking long-term, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. While short-term volatility is possible, economic progress and wealth generation are long-term trends that can be capitalized on through stock market investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. The greatest risk lies in not understanding how the system works and making impulsive decisions based on panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>.

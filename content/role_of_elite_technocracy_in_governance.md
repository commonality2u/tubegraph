The discussion of the role of elite technocracy in governance was one of the focal points in Garrett Jones's conversation on the podcast. Jones, an economist from George Mason University, delves into the implications and practicalities of technocratic versus democratic control, particularly in the context of affluent democracies.

## Technocracy versus Democracy

The tension between technocratic and democratic control is a consistent theme in Jones's works, particularly in his book "10% Less Democracy." Jones suggests that elite technocratic control might work best in high IQ countries, where such elites can craft better policies without the immediate pressures of democratic accountability that might lead to suboptimal decision-making. He believes that rich democracies, with their stable systems, could benefit from increased technocratic governance by independent committees where knowledgeable experts lead without much political interference [[role_of_political_advisers_and_technocrats | Garrett Jones explores the role of technocrats in policy-making]].

## Case Study: The Federal Reserve and the FDA

Jones provides a comparison between the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to highlight the effectiveness of technocratic governance. The Fed, which enjoys significant independence due to its structure, has the freedom to operate with minimal congressional oversight, an arrangement Jones credits for its effectiveness. In contrast, the FDA is more politically constrained, subject to congressional funding and presidential influence, which Jones argues diminishes its effectiveness [[impact_of_technology_on_government_and_policy | highlighting the impact of governance structure on policy effectiveness]].

## European Union as a Technocracy

The European Union (EU) is also highlighted as an example of technocratic governance. While Jones notes that the EU's technocrats are often criticized for not being market-friendly enough, he argues that the EU actually tends to promote economic freedom as countries prepare to join it, despite public perception to the contrary. Technocracy in the EU, therefore, can pull in the direction of the market compared to some of its member countries' own policies [[impact_of_historical_and_cultural_factors_on_development | examining the EU's governance in context of historical and cultural influences]].

## Risks and Limitations

However, the effectiveness of technocracy is contingent on the surrounding political environment. Jones is wary of applying technocratic governance in less affluent democracies, where elites might revert to rent-seeking behavior and ignore broader societal needs. In less prosperous democracies, the lack of democratic oversight might lead to governance that primarily serves self-interested elite classes [[role_of_experts_and_peer_review_in_social_sciences | discussing the risks of technocracy without adequate checks and balances]].

## Conclusion

Garrett Jones advocates for a nuanced approach to governance, suggesting that a balance of technocratic control with democratic oversight might yield the best results in enhancing institutional effectiveness and policy outcomes. The sophisticated interplay between democracy and technocracy remains critical, especially in ensuring that technocratic institutions remain accountable while leveraging their potential to foster long-term growth and stability in a nation [[challenges_in_government_efficiency_and_policy_making | examining the balance between technocracy and democracy]].

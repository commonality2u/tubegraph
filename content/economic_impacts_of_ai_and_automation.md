From: [[dwarkesh | The Dwarkesh Podcast]]

This article summarizes discussions by Tamay Besiroglu and Ege Erdil on the economic impacts of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation, based on a podcast episode. They are the founders of Mechanize, a company focused on automating all work [00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00:00:38), [00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00:00:44).

Tamay Besiroglu argues that the concept of an "intelligence explosion" is not very useful for understanding the coming AI transition, likening it to calling the Industrial Revolution a "horsepower explosion" [00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00:00:50)-[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00:00:59). While the Industrial Revolution saw a drastic acceleration in raw physical power, many other complementary changes in sectors like agriculture, transportation, law, finance, and urbanization were equally, if not more, important in explaining the acceleration of growth and technological change [01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01:01:04)-[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01:01:48). Similarly, while AI development will yield very smart systems, these will be just one part among many moving parts driving the expected transition and acceleration in growth [02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:02:03)-[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:02:19).

# Timelines for AI-Driven Automation

Besiroglu and Erdil project longer timelines for achieving advanced AI capabilities, such as a drop-in remote worker replacement, compared to many in San Francisco.
*   **Tamay Besiroglu's Prediction:** Around 2045 for a drop-in remote worker replacement [02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:02:37)-[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:02:40).
*   **Ege Erdil's Prediction:** Slightly more bullish, but generally aligned with longer timelines [02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:02:45).

Their reasoning includes:
*   **Current Automation Levels:** The fraction of the economy currently automated by AI is very small. Extrapolating this trend would suggest centuries for full automation, a view they don't fully endorse but use to counter overly optimistic extrapolations [03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03:03:58)-[04:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04:04:10).
*   **Unlocking Core Capabilities:** Many core capabilities are yet to be unlocked. Over the past 10-15 years, with 9-10 orders of magnitude (OOM) of compute scaling, a few big capabilities like sophisticated gameplay, language, and abstract reasoning/coding were unlocked, roughly one every three years or three OOM of compute [04:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04:04:18)-[05:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05:05:41). Future needs include long-horizon coherence, agency, autonomy, and full multimodal understanding [05:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05:06:01)-[06:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06:06:13).
*   **Compute Scaling Limits:** Further compute scaling is becoming harder. They estimate perhaps 3-4 OOM of scaling left before data centers, energy infrastructure, and fabs consume a non-trivial fraction of world output [[data_center_energy_requirements_and_scaling]] [06:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06:06:46)-[07:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07:07:12). Current AI chip production is still a small fraction of even leading-edge semiconductor capacity [[semiconductor_industry_and_trade_secrets]] [07:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07:07:18)-[07:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07:07:28).
*   **Complexity of Jobs:** Many observers underestimate the complexity of real-world jobs. Automating a single task (e.g., booking a flight, which current AI still struggles with [08:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08:08:07)-[08:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08:08:10)) does not automate an entire job, as that task is often a small fraction of an employee's actual work [08:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08:08:35)-[09:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09:09:18).
*   **"Unhobblings" vs. New Capabilities:** The idea that current models are "baby AGIs" just needing "unhobbling" (e.g., more data, context) is challenged. While ChatGPT's chatbot ability was an "unhobbling" with ~1% additional compute [10:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10:10:44)-[11:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11:01:05), this was built on a massive prior technological stack. Achieving new capabilities like agency might seem simple in hindsight but will likely require a similar, difficult build-up of complementary innovations over years [[complementary_innovations_and_technological_progress]] [11:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11:11:30)-[13:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13:13:24).

# Automating R&D and the "Software-Only Singularity"

A common argument for rapid AI advancement is that AI will automate its own R&D, leading to a "software-only singularity" [[intelligence_explosion_and_its_implications]][24:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24:04:03)-[24:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24:04:26). Besiroglu and Erdil are skeptical:

*   **Current AI R&D Capabilities:** While AI excels at certain coding tasks or reasoning problems impressive to humans (e.g., competitive programming [25:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25:05:09)), they lack the broader competences needed for the full research process. Real R&D involves working with large, messy codebases and vague instructions, unlike constrained evaluation tasks (e.g., METR evals [25:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25:05:49)-[26:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26:06:21)).
*   **Creativity and Conceptual Innovation:** Current reasoning models leverage vast pre-existing knowledge rather than exhibiting genuine creativity [29:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29:09:29)-[30:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30:30:40). They are not yet capable of generating novel conceptual schemes or identifying fruitful, long-horizon research directions in messy contexts, as seen in mathematics where no new interesting concepts have emerged from them [28:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28:08:07)-[31:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31:31:41).
*   **Moravec's Paradox:** AI makes rapid progress on tasks humans find hard but are evolutionarily recent (e.g., abstract reasoning, math, chess). These skills correlate strongly with general competence in humans but less so in AI [31:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31:31:43)-[34:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34:04:04). Therefore, AI success on these tasks shouldn't lead to over-updating on their general R&D ability [[ai_for_science_and_societal_challenges]] [34:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34:04:40)-[34:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34:04:59).
*   **The Role of Compute and Experiments:** A significant portion of software progress, including in AI, has been driven by compute scaling, not just cognitive effort [26:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26:06:57)-[27:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27:07:15). The history of R&D suggests diminishing returns to pure research effort if not complemented by other inputs [48:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48:08:40)-[49:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49:09:14). Many key AI innovations (Transformer, Flash Attention, Chinchilla scaling laws) are hardware or scaling-related [[ai_scalability_and_breakthroughs]] [51:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51:05:06)-[51:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51:05:54). Even if AI researchers become highly efficient, progress will be bottlenecked by the available (and more slowly growing) stock of experimental compute [[role_of_compute_in_ai_development]] [56:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56:05:54)-[57:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57:07:23).

# Explosive Economic Growth Scenarios

Besiroglu and Erdil foresee the possibility of explosive economic growth (e.g., >30% annually [01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01:07:08)), but through a broader automation process rather than a narrow software-only singularity.

*   **Broad Economic Upgrading:** True transformative growth, akin to the Industrial Revolution, requires upgrading across many sectors, not just isolated AI advancement. This involves scaling up data collection, supply chains, and deploying AI broadly throughout the economy [[impact_and_future_of_ai_in_economic_systems]] [01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01:08:51)-[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01:11:00).
*   **Interplay of Factors:** Technological progress involves a complex interplay between invention, capital accumulation, infrastructure build-out (e.g., Edison's lightbulb needing an electricity grid [01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01:18:30)-[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01:19:12)), learning-by-doing (e.g., solar panel efficiency [01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01:16:32)-[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01:16:52)), and market demand [01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01:22:01).
*   **Geographic Distribution:** Initially, growth might be concentrated in jurisdictions with favorable regulations and adoption rates, similar to Britain and the Netherlands during the Industrial Revolution [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation]] [01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01:13:50)-[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01:14:05), [02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:22:49)-[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:23:23). Norms might shift to become more conducive to AI deployment, potentially emulating models like the UAE [01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01:14:18)-[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01:14:56).
*   **Consumption and Output:** The massive increase in output would be absorbed through both an "intensive margin" (more of current goods and services, as global per capita GDP is far below that of the wealthy [02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:36:40)-[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:37:18)) and, more importantly, an "extensive margin" (a vast expansion in product variety across all sectors, similar to the Industrial Revolution [02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:37:20)-[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:38:07)).

## Objections to Explosive Growth

Several common objections to such rapid growth are addressed:
*   **Bottlenecks (e.g., Tyler Cowen's Sub-Saharan Africa example):** They agree that intelligence isn't the sole bottleneck and that factors like governance and infrastructure are crucial. This supports their view of needing broad, multi-faceted scaling [02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:20:57)-[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:22:21).
*   **Baumol Cost Disease:** While a valid qualitative concern, its quantitative impact depends on the specific sectors, their share of output, elasticity of substitution, and the potential for labor reallocation from automated to non-automated sectors. The H100 payback example illustrates a path to rapid doubling times even with such effects [[cost_disease_and_economic_bottlenecks]] [02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:38:11)-[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:42:38).
*   **O-Ring Tasks:** The O-ring model (output being a product of many inputs) doesn't inherently prevent scaling if all inputs can scale, or if AI can substitute for underperforming (human) components [[human_and_ai_labor_dynamics]] [02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:42:58)-[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:45:08).
*   **Regulation:** This is considered the strongest objection. While international competition and national security provide strong incentives against overly restrictive regulation, historical precedents like human cloning show global coordination is possible. They assign a non-negligible chance (e.g., 10-20%) to effective global regulation significantly slowing AI deployment [[challenges_in_ai_governance]] [02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:45:09)-[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:46:49).
*   **Deployment Time:** While deploying new technologies and integrating them into existing supply chains takes time, the rapid adoption of ChatGPT shows fast digital deployment is possible [02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:48:24)-[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:48:30). If AI systems become true drop-in replacements for human workers, companies can onboard them relatively quickly (e.g., within months), bypassing the slower process of firms re-organizing around novel, non-substitutable AI tools [02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:48:37)-[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:49:31).

# Economic Properties of AI Firms

AI-native firms will possess unique economic advantages beyond individual AI intelligence:
*   **Perfect Replication:** The ability to copy AI workers, including their tacit knowledge and culture, without degradation. This solves problems of culture dilution and loss of key personnel seen in human firms [02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:49:39)-[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:50:42).
*   **Enhanced Evolution:** AI firms could achieve high-fidelity replication, the missing piece (along with variation and selection) for rapid evolution of firm structures and capabilities [02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:50:52)-[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:51:08).
*   **Incentive Alignment:** AI workers can be fine-tuned to align with firm goals, potentially eliminating principal-agent problems [[ai_alignment_and_cooperation_challenges]] [02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:52:23)-[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:53:02). High-bandwidth internal communication and oversight by hyper-scaled "manager" AIs can ensure coherent vision [02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:53:04)-[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:54:06).
*   **Economies of Scale in Learning & Deployment:** Increased compute can train better models (smarter workers) and run more copies. Learning happens once in a large training run and is then deployed universally, avoiding redundant individual human learning [02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:54:25)-[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:55:14).
*   **Potential for Central Planning:** While not necessarily optimal, central planning within AI firms or even larger AI economic blocs might become more feasible due to higher communication bandwidth, disaggregated sensing and central processing, superior intelligence of planner AIs, and improved incentive alignment [02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:55:23)-[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:57:55). However, the increasing complexity of a larger economy presents a counteracting challenge [[decentralization_vs_central_planning_in_economics]] [02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:58:18)-[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:58:56).

# Rationale for Accelerating Automation

Besiroglu and Erdil advocate for accelerating the broad automation of labor:
*   **Vast Economic Benefits:** Expect an enormous increase in economic growth, leading to immense wealth and unimaginable new products, significantly improving quality of life (e.g., in healthcare) [[the_impact_of_ai_and_quantum_computing_on_industries_like_gaming_and_healthcare]] [02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:13:24)-[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:13:38).
*   **Impact on Wages and Capital:** Initially, human wages are likely to rise due to complementarity with AI. In the long term, wages may fall due to arbitrage with AI workers, but by then humans could own significant capital and benefit from a vastly larger economy [02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:13:43)-[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:14:09).
*   **Cost of Delay:** Each year of delay in achieving this automated future represents a massive loss in potential welfare, equivalent to tens of trillions of dollars in consumption and potentially hundreds of millions of lives lost that could have been saved by advanced technology [[ai_safety_and_existential_risks]] [02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:14:57)-[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:18:20).
*   **Safety and Alignment:** They are not convinced that slowing down AI progress necessarily improves safety or alignment outcomes [[challenges_in_ai_alignment_and_potential_risks]]. Progress on alignment itself often depends on scaling compute and conducting experiments with more advanced systems. Trying to solve alignment with 2016-level compute, for example, would have yielded little progress [[ai_alignment_and_safety_concerns]] [02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:15:59)-[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:16:51). Their view is that the transformative effects of AI will be diffuse, reducing the leverage of any single actor to catastrophically misalign development [02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:19:28)-[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02:20:20).

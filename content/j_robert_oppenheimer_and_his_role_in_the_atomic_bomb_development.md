J. Robert Oppenheimer was an American theoretical physicist and the scientific director of the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II, playing a pivotal role in the Manhattan Project, which developed the first nuclear weapons.

## Early Life and Influences

Oppenheimer was born into considerable wealth, with Impressionist paintings adorning his family's apartments in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. His father had amassed a fortune by cornering the market on uniform linings for military uniforms before and during World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. His income during the war years and before was estimated to be around $100,000 a month, a significant sum in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

For most of his early years, Oppenheimer "lived in his head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. It wasn't until he got to Berkeley and discovered that some of his prime students were living on "cans of god-awful cat food" due to poverty that he understood the great suffering in the world and became actively involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Physically, Oppenheimer was about six feet tall and "rail thin," never weighing more than about 140 pounds. One contemporary noted he could sit in a children's high chair comfortably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Political Views and Associations

### Communist Sympathies
During the 1930s, Oppenheimer was a communist sympathizer, less for the theory and more for the practical matter of helping Jews escape from Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Jean Tatlock, one of the loves of his life, was also involved in these efforts and was a member of the Communist Party, likely encouraging him to attend meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. However, Richard Rhodes asserts there is no possibility whatsoever that Oppenheimer shared information with the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Oppenheimer reportedly read Marx on a train trip and found it to be "a bunch of hooey, just ridiculous," lacking logical coherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

His brother, Frank Oppenheimer, and Frank's wife were members of the Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. It's believed that J. Robert Oppenheimer's misleading statements to security personnel during World War II about approaches for espionage were primarily an effort to cover up his brother's involvement, to ensure Frank could remain involved in the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Role in the Manhattan Project

### Early Conceptualization
As a professor at Berkeley, within a week of the news of nuclear fission reaching the university, Oppenheimer had a drawing on his blackboard depicting both a reactor and a bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.

### Director of Los Alamos Laboratory
Oppenheimer was the scientific director of the Los Alamos Laboratory. He pushed for a centralized laboratory where scientists could freely discuss ideas, arguing against General Groves' initial system of compartmentalization, stating that science works by "gift exchange" and open communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:11">[01:44:11]</a>. Groves reluctantly agreed but insisted the facility be behind barbed wire in a remote location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:48">[01:44:48]</a>.

When recruiting scientists for Los Alamos, Oppenheimer, unable to reveal the project's secret nature, would tell potential recruits that their work would "certainly end this war and it may end all war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>. The average age at Los Alamos was 27; Oppenheimer, at 39, was considered an "old guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:39">[02:00:39]</a>.

### Leadership Qualities
Even Edward Teller, who became one of Oppenheimer's staunchest critics, admitted that "Robert Oppenheimer was the best lab director I ever knew" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:46">[01:34:46]</a>. Hans Bethe noted that while Oppenheimer could be cruel before and after the war by pouncing on mistakes, during the war, he was a "superb wise lab director" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:28">[01:45:28]</a>.

Oppenheimer possessed a "divided self and an insecure self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:13">[01:36:13]</a>. He was described as a "superb actor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:44">[01:37:44]</a>, lavish and courtly with women, but capable of being harsh in the classroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:53">[01:37:53]</a>. His physics course was so advanced that many top students took it twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:17">[01:38:17]</a>. I.I. Rabi commented that Oppenheimer "could never decide whether he wanted to be president of the [B'nai B'rith] or the Knights of Columbus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:33">[01:36:33]</a>, highlighting his complex identity as a German Jew who was westernized and attended the Ethical Culture School rather than a Jewish school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:53">[01:36:53]</a>.

Rabi also noted that Oppenheimer's insecurity extended to physics; he preferred to know everything going on broadly rather than focusing deeply on one problem, which Rabi believed was why Oppenheimer never won a Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:12">[01:39:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:59">[01:46:59]</a>. Despite this, Oppenheimer and a graduate student developed the basic idea of the black hole in a 1929 paper, a contribution that might have earned him a Nobel if black holes had been discovered during his lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>. He was also known for his wide-ranging intellect, learning Sanskrit to read the Bhagavad Gita in the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:34">[01:46:34]</a>.

General Groves, who had engineering degrees from MIT, relied on Oppenheimer to explain the physics involved in the project, with Oppenheimer later describing himself as Groves' "idiot savant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21">[01:41:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:06">[01:42:06]</a>.

Oppenheimer, along with Niels Bohr, brought to Los Alamos the paradoxical idea that the atomic bomb, while incredibly destructive, might also end large-scale war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:37">[01:48:37]</a>.

## Post-War Era and Legacy

### Views on the Hydrogen Bomb
Oppenheimer resisted the development of the hydrogen bomb. During his security clearance hearing, when asked if he would have used a hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima, he replied "No," because "the target was too small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. He believed there was no military use for such huge weapons and that by introducing them, the U.S. was making itself a better target due to its greater number of cities compared to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.

### Acheson-Lilienthal Plan
After the war, Oppenheimer was a key figure in a committee under the State Department that developed the Acheson-Lilienthal Plan for international control of atomic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. In a couple of weeks, he taught the committee members (industrialists, engineers, government officials) the basics of nuclear physics and bomb design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>. The plan proposed an "open world" where an international agency could inspect any country's nuclear facilities at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>. If a country clandestinely began building bombs, this would be detected, allowing for diplomacy, conventional war, or ultimately, other nations building their own bombs in response over a period of perhaps six months to a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. When Bernard Baruch, who presented the plan to the UN, asked what would happen if a country started building a bomb, Oppenheimer stated, "Well, that would be an act of war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>.

### Security Hearing
Oppenheimer's opposition to the Air Force's preferred hydrogen bomb program led to his security clearance being questioned and ultimately revoked in 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:32">[02:27:32]</a>. A close friend noted that Oppenheimer was "never the same" after the hearing, becoming one of Yeats's "smiling public men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:45">[02:27:45]</a>. The experience deeply affected him, playing on his lifelong insecurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. He subsequently became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:10">[02:28:10]</a>.

## Portrayals in Media
A new movie about Oppenheimer was set to be released (as of the podcast recording), with Cillian Murphy, who played a role in *Peaky Blinders*, portraying him. Richard Rhodes, who was consulted for the film, noted that the actor looked remarkably like Oppenheimer, capturing his height and thinness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The trailer accurately depicted aspects like the Trinity test device [[the_making_and_impact_of_the_atomic_bomb]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

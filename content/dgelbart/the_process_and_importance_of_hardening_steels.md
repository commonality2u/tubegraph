## Introduction to Steel Hardening

Hardening steel is a critical process for improving its mechanical properties, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from cutting tools to structural components. This involves heating the steel to a specific temperature and then cooling it, followed by tempering to achieve the desired balance of hardness and toughness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

## Types of Hardenable Steels

For a well-equipped shop, a minimal stock of hardenable steels includes specific types each with distinct advantages and uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

### A2 Air-Hardening Steel

A2 steel is recommended as the primary hardenable steel for a shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. Its key advantages include:
*   **No Quenching Required**: Unlike other hardenable steels, A2 only needs to be heated and allowed to cool in air to harden, simplifying the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   **Low Dimensional Change**: A2 is optimized to exhibit very low dimensional change after hardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. This means parts can be made practically to net shape, reducing the need for extensive post-hardening machining or grinding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. In contrast, regular carbon steel can experience significant dimensional changes upon hardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

### 440 Stainless Steel

Specifically, 440 [[properties_and_uses_of_different_metals_particularly_stainless_steel | stainless steel]] is a hardenable type useful, especially in medical devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. While not as corrosion-resistant as 300 series stainless, it's used for items like surgical tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. It hardens similarly to A2 steel by heating and cooling quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

### High-Speed Steel

High-speed steel (HSS) is the material used for most cutting tools, drills, and reamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. If you need to make a custom cutting tool, a piece of HSS can be ground to shape, but it cannot be annealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

### Carbon Steel

Regular carbon steel is the most affordable hardenable steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. However, it requires quenching, which introduces more complexity and requires more metallurgical knowledge compared to air-hardening steels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

## Identifying Steels: The Spark Test

Since different types of steel can look identical, the easiest way to differentiate them is through a spark test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. This involves holding the steel to a grinder and observing the sparks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>:
*   **Mild Steel**: Produces very few sparks, and these sparks do not have a "star" pattern at their end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **Carbon Steel**: Generates many more sparks, and each spark features a "star" pattern at its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **A2 Steel**: Shows darker, dimmer sparks with no star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.
*   **High-Speed Steel**: Produces even darker sparks, almost no sparks at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>, which are redder rather than white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.
*   **440 Stainless Steel**: Similar to HSS, produces practically no sparks at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. It's easy to distinguish from A2 steel by this characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

## The Hardening Process

The best way to harden steels is in an oven or kiln <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. However, small pieces can be quickly hardened using a torch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.

### Heating

When using a torch, it's crucial to place a thermal insulator, such as a fire brick, behind the piece to reflect heat and prevent it from escaping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. This can double the heating speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. For A2 steel, the nominal hardening temperature is 950°C, which is white hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. Building a small furnace, possibly with a cover, can further accelerate heating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

### Cooling (Quenching vs. Air Cooling)

Once heated to the proper temperature, the steel is allowed to cool. For air-hardening steels like A2, it's simply left to cool in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. If insulated during heating, it might need to be moved away to cool faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. After cooling, the steel will be fully hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

### Preventing Decarburization

When steel is heated, its outer layer can decarbonize, leading to a loss of hardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. To prevent this, especially when hardening A2 steel in an oven, wrap the piece in [[properties_and_uses_of_different_metals_particularly_stainless_steel | stainless steel]] foil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. For best results, wrap the steel in paper first, then in the [[properties_and_uses_of_different_metals_particularly_stainless_steel | stainless steel]] foil, sealing the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. The oxygen inside the bag will be absorbed as the paper carbonizes before the steel loses its own carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

## The Tempering Process

After hardening, steel is fully hard but also brittle, meaning it can shatter easily if struck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

### Purpose

Tempering is the second stage of heat treatment, performed to achieve a trade-off between hardness and toughness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. It reduces brittleness while retaining sufficient hardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

### Temperature and Color Changes

Tempering involves reheating the steel to a specific temperature range, typically between 220°C and 300°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
*   **220°C**: Achieves a hardness of Rockwell RC60, suitable for most applications, and is indicated by a "straw" color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
*   **300°C**: Results in a Rockwell hardness of RC56 but provides much better toughness, crucial for parts that need impact strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. This temperature is indicated by a light blue color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

Steel exhibits distinct color changes in this range, allowing for visual judgment of temperature when using a torch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>:
*   Straw color (approx. 220°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>
*   Brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>
*   Very dark blue (approx. 270°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>
*   Light blue (approx. 300°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>

Every 10°C in this range makes a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. When tempering with a torch, use a small flame and keep it moving to avoid overheating one spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. For asymmetric parts, direct more heat to the thicker sections to ensure even tempering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.

## Applications and Tools

### Custom Cutting Tools

A useful technique is to [[comparing_the_strength_and_aesthetic_of_brazed_assemblies_to_traditional_cast_iron | braze]] a piece of carbide (from a discarded insert) onto a mild steel stem to create custom cutting tools or special size drills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. This is done by placing the carbide, flux, and brazing alloy on the stem, heating the assembly until the brazing alloy flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.

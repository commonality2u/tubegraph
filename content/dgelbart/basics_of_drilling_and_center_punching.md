This article covers fundamental aspects of machining, focusing on [[techniques_for_precise_hole_drilling_and_reaming | drilling]] precise holes and associated techniques such as center punching, deburring, reaming, and boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Center Punching for Accuracy

When drilling a hole, it is typically necessary to center punch the location to guide the drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

*   **Laying Out:** To accurately place a center punch, first lay out the desired location by scribing intersecting lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Any sharp tool, like a scriber, can be used for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Locating by Feel:** Critically, locate the center punch by feel, not by looking at the lines, as this is significantly more accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Slide the punch until you feel it lock into the crossing of the scribed lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Punching Process:**
    1.  Make a light center mark first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    2.  Reinforce it with a bigger, deeper center mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Punch Sharpness:** Center punches must be very sharp, sharpened at about a 90-degree tip angle, to allow for tactile location of the scribed lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Improving Line Visibility:** If lines are hard to see, use a layout fluid (like a razor-ball marker) over the area; the scribed lines will show clearly, and the fluid can be wiped off instantly after marking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Drilling Precise Holes

For very precise holes, or when drilling large diameters, start with a smaller pilot hole and then enlarge it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

*   **Pilot Hole Necessity:** The web width of a larger drill bit can straddle a center mark, preventing accurate centering. A smaller pilot drill centers itself more effectively on the mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Using a Center Drill:** If a center punch wasn't used, begin with a center drill. This tool is very rigid and prevents the drill from walking off the intended spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Electronic Readout:** When drilling, zeroing the electronic readout on the machine is a good practice. This allows you to return to the precise zero point if handles are accidentally bumped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## [[methods_for_deburring_and_countersinking | Deburring and Countersinking]]

After drilling, it's efficient to deburr the hole while the workpiece is still set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

*   **Tools:** A countersink is commonly used for deburring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Specific deburring tools are also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Drill Sharpness Indication:** If a large burr remains after drilling, it indicates the drill bit was not sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Internal Deburring:** For inaccessible areas like the inside of a pipe or box, a modified wood chisel can be used. Sharpen it to a dull angle (80-90 degrees) and optionally round the tip. Position it almost parallel to the surface and hit with a hammer to shear off internal burrs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Reaming for Accuracy

Reaming is a step beyond drilling for achieving more accurate diameters and better surface finishes, especially for applications like bearing fits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

*   **Process:**
    1.  Drill an undersized pilot hole, typically 0.1-0.2 mm smaller than the final reamed size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    2.  Apply cutting oil or wax to the reamer, particularly for aluminum, which can stick to the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    3.  Operate at a low speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    4.  Don't worry about run-out; the reamer is flexible and will self-align in the hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Reamer Limitations:** Reamers are slightly tapered, meaning they require a through-hole to achieve full accuracy and cannot be used for blind holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Preventing Shaft Binding in Precision Holes

When inserting a precise shaft into a reamed or precisely bored hole, binding can occur due to fundamental geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

*   **Solution:** Machine a recess on the shaft. Leave about one millimeter of the full diameter, followed by a several-millimeter-wide groove, and then return to the full diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Mechanism:** This narrow initial ring allows for tilting, preventing locking. As the shaft descends, the second full-diameter section self-aligns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This trick saves significant time, especially with large shafts and bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Boring for Variable and Large Holes

Boring is a method comparable in accuracy to reaming but allows for variable hole sizes and is suitable for large or blind holes where reamers are not practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

*   **Machine Rigidity:** Due to its single-point cutting action, boring requires extreme machine rigidity. There are no balancing forces like in a drill's two flutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
    *   Lock the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
    *   Minimize column overhang by raising the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
    *   Ensure everything is tight and rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Adjust the boring head for the desired diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
    2.  Take multiple passes, going back and forth, to remove any flagships or tool deflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Advantage:** Boring allows machining to a specific depth, making it ideal for step or blind holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Milling Considerations for Housing and Parts

While not directly drilling, milling is often used to create housings or parts, and shares principles of precision and rigidity with drilling and boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

*   **Cutter Types:**
    *   **Ball Nose Cutters:** Have a round nose. They remove metal faster and are less prone to breakage than regular cutters because they lack a sharp edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Specify round internal corners in designs to allow for their use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
    *   **Regular Cutters:** Have sharp corners.
*   **Machine Stiffness:** Milling accuracy and speed are directly related to the machine's stiffness, or how much it can deflect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
    *   The formula for stiffness is approximately D^4 / L^3 (diameter to the power of 4 divided by length to the power of 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This means a larger diameter and shorter mill dramatically increase stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
    *   Design parts to use the biggest possible mill diameter and shortest mill length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Housing Design for Milling:** When designing a housing, ideally split it roughly in the middle, not with one very deep and one shallow part. A deep housing would require a long mill, which is significantly less stiff and slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Minimizing Clamping:**
    *   Minimize the number of clampings needed to machine a part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
    *   Multiple clampings reduce accuracy, as features are no longer registered to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
    *   **Tooling Holes:** Consider incorporating tooling holes into the design where aesthetically acceptable. These can be used with screws into T-nuts on T-slots, allowing up to five out of six sides to be machined in a single clamping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
    *   Minimizing clamping also reduces the need for manual intervention on CNC machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

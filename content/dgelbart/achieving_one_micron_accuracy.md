Achieving accuracy within one micron (0.001 mm) or 40 millionths of an inch is a significant feat in [[high_precision_machining_techniques | machining]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This level of [[high_accuracy_in_machining | high accuracy in machining]] is necessary for a variety of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Applications of One Micron Accuracy

One practical application demonstrating the need for one-micron accuracy is the creation of a cylinder and piston assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. When produced with this [[precision_and_adjustability_in_mechanical_components | precision]], the piston achieves a "complete sliding fit" within the cylinder, appearing "completely loose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. However, when an air vent is sealed, the assembly becomes "completely airtight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Another key property of such accurate parts is their ability to spin "freely as if it's on ball bearings," functioning like a self-acting air bearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This means the inner piece can spin "frictionlessly for a long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. A bearing made to this tolerance would "never need lubrication and never wear out" because there is "no contact between the inner part and the outer part" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This concept is similar to air bearings found in hard drives or other self-acting air bearing devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Producing such parts without a [[High precision CNC lathe and grinder | high precision CNC lathe and grinder]] would typically require time-consuming lapping to achieve the required tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Machine Design for One Micron Accuracy

A scratch-built [[High precision CNC lathe and grinder | high precision CNC lathe and grinder]] can cut, turn, and grind parts to a tolerance of one micron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This machine is a full CNC system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Chuck Design

The machine features an unusual chuck design, based on an extinct American design by Skinner Chuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This chuck remains completely watertight at any jaw opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This is achieved through drive pins and a slot covered by the jaw itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. For very small loads, parts can be gripped using pins inserted into the chuck, allowing for ID or OD gripping without changing jaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. These pins provide a wide gripping range (0 to ~200 mm diameter) in addition to the regular jaw gripping range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

The chuck also includes a run-out adjustment with two screws, allowing the run-out to be zeroed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This is highly useful for removing and re-inserting a job while maintaining alignment to a reference surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### Air Bearings

All major moving parts of the machine, including the tailstock, saddle, cross-slide, main spindle, and grinding spindle, float on air bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The air bearings for the main and grinder spindles are surplus units from semiconductor machinery, which are often air bearing-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Machine Bed Construction

Achieving one-micron accuracy requires starting with a very good machine bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The bed is constructed using economically sourced granite parallels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. These are granite bars with all four sides parallel to a micron over their entire length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

The bed is built by bonding one granite bar to another with epoxy to form T-sections, and then two of these T-sections form the complete bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. During the gluing process, the assembly is flipped upside down onto a granite table, and accurate spacers are placed inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This ensures that once the epoxy cures, the critical surfaces are co-planar and the gap between them is accurate to a micron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

Crucially, the glue joints are held under compression by bolts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This is because adhesives like epoxy are strong in pure shear mode but weak in other modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. By keeping the parts under compression, the epoxy is primarily subjected to shear stress, while other stresses are absorbed by the compression of the bolts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Other Features

*   **Manual Mode**: The machine can operate in a manual mode with digital readouts, serving as a backup if software issues arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Built-in Microscope**: A built-in microscope with a displayed feed is convenient for small work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Grinding Customization**: The grinding wheel can be removed to attach internal grinding mounts, collet adapters, or direct-mount internal grinding wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Custom internal grinding wheels can be easily made from used grinding stones using a waterjet cutter and epoxy mounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

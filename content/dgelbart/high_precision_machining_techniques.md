High precision machining is a specialized area focused on achieving extremely tight tolerances and accuracy in manufactured parts. Dan Gelbart's shop includes a dedicated high precision area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, featuring equipment designed for sub-micron accuracy.

## Precision Equipment

### Moor Number Three Jig Borer
The Moor Number Three Jig Borer is a machine capable of achieving [[achieving_one_micron_accuracy | 1 micron]] (or 40 millionths of an inch) accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Its precision extends to:
*   Orthogonality (squareness) of the three axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>
*   Straightness of motions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>
*   Calibration of micrometer lead screws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   Trueness of rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>

This machine comes with a test certificate traceable to the National Institute of Standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Lead screw errors, such as a half-micron error in X and Y, are designed to null out as the screws warm slightly during use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Materials like Invar, which does not change size with temperature, are used for critical components like the headstock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Manufacturers even employ specific techniques, such as final scrapers wearing aluminized aprons, to prevent body heat from distorting the machine during assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Precision Measurement and Alignment Tools

*   **Video Microscope**: A crucial accessory for a jig borer, enabling the location of features (like an edge or center of a hole) to [[achieving_one_micron_accuracy | one micron]] accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. By rotating the microscope, the true axis of rotation of the machine can be aligned with a target as small as five microns in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Rotary Tables / Dividing Heads**:
    *   **Two-Axis Rotary Table**: Features optical readouts for tilt and rotation, achieving an accuracy of approximately one to two arc seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   **Ultra-Dex**: Considered the most accurate device for dividing angles in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It uses two phase gears with 360 teeth that mesh at every one-degree interval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Its accuracy, down to a tenth of an arc second, is achieved by averaging out imperfections as the gears wear evenly over many engagements, and crucially, by defining the center of rotation through the meshing gears themselves, independent of bearing accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Granite Square**: For very high precision, a granite square, accurate to sub-micron levels, is used instead of traditional steel squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Autocollimator and Electronic Gauges**: Used for precise optical and electronic measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### High Precision CNC Lathe and Grinder
The shop includes a [[High precision CNC lathe and grinder | CNC lathe]] and a [[High precision CNC lathe and grinder | surface grinder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>, crucial for [[high_accuracy_in_machining | high accuracy in machining]].

## Precision Lathe Modifications

*   **Video Microscope on Lathe**: Similar to the jig borer, a video microscope (made from a car rearview camera kit) provides at least 100x magnification to precisely align the tool tip, especially useful for recutting threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Adjustable Chuck for Runout Removal**: A modified chuck allows for the removal of runout, exceeding the accuracy of standard collets (which are accurate to about three microns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This chuck is mounted on a system of ground and lapped steel plates, allowing it to be moved by eccentrics without losing rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This means runout can be eliminated at any point along a workpiece, not just at the chuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

## Drilling Holes Accurately
A small mill is primarily used as a drill, with adaptations such as a laser center finder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, a sliding-nut depth stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>, and a drilling vise with retractable stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a> to facilitate [[Drilling Holes Accurately | accurate drilling]].

## Tooling Standardization
Standardizing on one size collet, such as a three-quarter inch collet, means all tooling (e.g., boring bars) can fit the same collet, eliminating the need to change collets frequently and saving time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

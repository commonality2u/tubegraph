A [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet cutter]] is generally considered the ideal machine for cutting, but a CNC plasma cutter serves as a viable alternative, especially for budget-conscious users or specific tasks [00:01:06].

## Comparison with Waterjet Cutter

While a [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet cutter]] is a key machine for prototyping, a CNC plasma cutter (such as those made by Torch Mate) offers a "poor man's version" alternative [00:00:16].

*   **Cost:** A plasma cutter is approximately 1/10th the cost of a [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet cutter]] [00:00:40].
*   **Operating Cost:** Its operating costs are also about 1/10th that of a [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]] [00:00:42].
*   **Versatility:** Plasma cutters are much less versatile than [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jets]] [00:00:45].
    *   A [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]] can cut practically anything up to 2 inches thick or more, and cuts beautifully [00:00:54].
    *   A plasma cutter can only cut metals [00:00:51] and does not cut all metals equally well [00:00:51]. It struggles with materials that conduct heat away very fast, such as copper [00:10:06]. It cannot cut non-metallics [00:10:06].
*   **Cut Quality:** The cut quality of a plasma cutter is not as nice as a [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]] [00:08:24] but is "completely acceptable for Sheet Metal work" when used on a CNC table [00:08:27].

## Applications

Even when a [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet cutter]] is available, a plasma cutter can be useful in specific situations [00:06:16]:
*   **Large Workpieces:** For cutting holes in boxes or [[designing_enclosures_using_waterjet_cutting | enclosures]] that are too large to fit into a [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]], such as working on a car or a cabin [00:06:20].
*   **[[template_cutting_with_plasma_cutter | Template Cutting]]:** A precise hole can be cut using a [[template_cutting_with_plasma_cutter | template]] made on a [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]] [00:06:36]. The [[template_cutting_with_plasma_cutter | template]] should be oversized to account for the plasma nozzle's diameter [00:06:44]. The plasma torch tip can follow the [[template_cutting_with_plasma_cutter | template]], with insulation (like a ceramic cap or tape) to prevent electrical contact and maintain distance from the material [00:06:57]. This method is useful for "quick and dirty work" [00:09:48].

## Operation and Capabilities

A plasma cutter like the one demonstrated is a top unit, very light, and requires only compressed air and regular household power [00:06:06].

*   **Cutting Range:** It can cut up to quarter-inch steel, with larger models capable of cutting up to 3/4 inch steel [00:09:55]. It can cut stainless steel and aluminum [00:10:03].
*   **Arc Transfer:** The machine transfers an internal arc to the workpiece [00:07:30].

## Safety Considerations

[!WARNING]
When operating a plasma cutter, [[safety_considerations_when_using_cutting_equipment | safety]] is paramount:
*   **Sparks:** Avoid placing flammable materials (like a butane bottle) near the cutting area, as the machine generates sparks [00:07:45].
*   **UV Radiation:** The plasma cutter emits significant ultraviolet (UV) radiation [00:08:01].
*   **Eye Protection:** Goggles are necessary to protect against both sparks and intense UV light. UV-filtered glasses are effective [00:07:55].

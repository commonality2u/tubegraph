This article details the features and operation of a scratch-built, [[high_precision_cnc_lathe_design_and_functionality | high-precision lathe and grinder]] designed by Dan Gart. The machine is capable of cutting, turning, and grinding parts to an accuracy of one micron (40 millionths of an inch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

## Precision Capabilities and Applications

The extreme precision of this machine enables the creation of parts with unique properties. An example is a cylinder and piston assembly where the piston is a complete sliding fit within the cylinder, yet it is completely airtight when the air vent is sealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. Due to its accuracy, the piston can spin freely, functioning like a self-acting air bearing, eliminating contact between parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Such a bearing would never need lubrication and never wear out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This technology is similar to air bearings found in hard drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Manufacturing parts to this tolerance directly from the machine eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## CNC Operation

The machine is a full [[high_precision_cnc_lathe_design_and_functionality | CNC machine]], built from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. The CNC software was developed by engineer James Midley from Vancouver, BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. A standard software package could not be used because this machine functions as both a lathe and a grinder, with several special features requiring a customized CNC package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

### Demonstrations
*   **Thread Cutting**: The machine can be programmed to cut a thread, with the cutting action magnified and viewed through a video camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.
*   **Multipass Grinding**: It can also perform multipass grinding operations, with a controlled coolant flow to minimize splashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.

## Manual Operation

A convenient feature of this lathe is its ability to operate manually with digital readouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. This provides a backup if any software issues arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

## Key Features Supporting Precision and Flexibility

### Machine Construction
To achieve one-micron accuracy, the machine is built upon a very precise bed and uses high-quality spindles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.
*   **Bed**: The bed is constructed from [[materials_and_construction_methods_for_precision_machinery | granite parallels]], which are bars of granite with all four sides parallel to a micron over their entire length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. The bed is formed by bonding these bars with epoxy, creating T-shaped sections that are then combined to form the full bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
*   **Assembly**: During assembly, the entire structure is flipped upside down on a granite table, with accurate spacers inserted, ensuring the surfaces are coplanar and the gap is accurate to a micron once the epoxy cures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
*   **Epoxy Reinforcement**: The glue joints are held under compression by bolts, as epoxy is strong in pure shear but weak in other modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. This compression ensures the epoxy is primarily subjected to shear stress, enhancing the structural integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

### Air Bearings
All moving parts, including the saddle, cross-slide, main spindle, and grinding spindle, utilize air bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. The tailstock is also mounted on air bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. The air bearings for the main and grinder spindles are surplus units from semiconductor machinery, which are readily available and economical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Chuck Design
The chuck features an unusual design, based on an extinct American design by Skinner Chuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. Its unique property is that it remains completely watertight at any jaw opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Grip Mechanism**: It utilizes drive pins that move the jaws, with the slots covered by the jaws themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   **Versatility**: Designed for very small loads, the chuck can grip parts using inserted pins on both the inner diameter (ID) or outer diameter (OD) without changing jaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This pin system, combined with the regular jaw gripping range, gives the chuck a very wide range, capable of gripping anything from zero to approximately 200 mm in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
*   **Runout Adjustment**: The chuck also includes runout adjustment screws, allowing the runout to be precisely zeroed. This is particularly useful when a job needs to be removed for an operation and then reinserted, as the runout can be adjusted to a reference surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

### Tailstock
The tailstock, also on air bearings, offers a very long travel of about 300 mm, from being fully retracted to fully extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. This allows for a long center distance (almost 600 mm) on a relatively small lathe, and even more if a bar can go inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

### Cross-Slide and Grinder Integration
The cross-slide has sufficient travel to accommodate both lathe tooling and the grinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. It can be moved forward for lathe work or back for grinding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
*   **Internal Grinding**: The grinding wheel is removable, allowing for the attachment of internal grinding mounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. This includes collet adapters for holding internal wheels or direct-mount internal grinding wheels that thread onto the spindle for greater rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.
*   **Custom Grinding Wheels**: Internal grinding wheels can be custom-made for specific jobs. Using a water jet cutter, any size wheel can be cut from a used grinding stone and then epoxied onto a shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. This provides access to the full range of wheel materials available for external wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

### Additional Features
A built-in microscope can be placed on the machine for magnified viewing of small work, with the image displayed on a screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.

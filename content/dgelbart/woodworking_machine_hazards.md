Surprisingly, [[workshop_safety_rules | woodworking machines]] are considered the most dangerous machines in a machine shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This is due to their very high operating speeds and extremely sharp tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Woodworking tools typically run at ten times the surface speed of metalworking tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## High Risk of Injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>

The chances of cutting off a finger in a woodworking machine are significantly higher than in any metalworking machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, as it only takes a fraction of a second for serious injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

> Even if the blade appears almost stopped, carelessly bringing your hand to it just before it completely stops can still sever a finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. A demonstration showed that a blade could cut a simulated finger twice with just its last few turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This makes woodworking machines very dangerous, even when nearly stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## [[safety_considerations_when_using_cutting_equipment | Safety Precautions]]

To minimize risks when using [[safety_considerations_when_using_cutting_equipment | cutting equipment]] like woodworking machines:

*   **Maintain Distance from Blades**
    Always stay away from the blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. When cutting the end of a piece of wood, ensure your hand is far enough from the blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Use Push Tools for Lengthwise Cuts**
    For lengthwise cuts where your hand might get closer to the blade, always use a separate piece of wood or a specialized push tool to guide the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Never use your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Avoid Standing Behind the Blade**
    Never be tempted to stand behind the blade, especially if you're working with a long piece and are tempted to pull it from the other side after a cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. If anything gets stuck, the blade can pull the wood and your hand directly into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Always work from the front side of the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

The press brake is a machine used for bending metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is typically set up to handle various bending operations, including regular bends, custom bends, and even flattening dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The flattening function serves as an "undo" button for incorrect bends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Operation and Setup

A press brake can be set up using a digital or manual gauge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Once a bend is performed, it can be undone, but achieving a perfect flat surface again is challenging due to the immense pressure required to make the metal flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. If a perfect unbend is required, the metal should be annealed by heating it to red hot with a butane torch before attempting to flatten it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Without annealing, flattening will leave a noticeable mark or ridge, even with a 100-ton press, because the metal work hardens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Tooling and Capabilities

The thickness of metal that can be bent depends on three main parameters: the material's thickness, its width, and the die's opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. For example, a 24-ton press brake can bend full widths of about gauge 12 (just under 3 mm) steel with a specific die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Using a wider V-die allows for bending thicker material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. To avoid frequent tool changes, it's recommended to keep a 3/4 inch die, which allows bending thick material in narrow sections and 2.5 to 3 mm material on full width for steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Aluminum can be bent in greater thicknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Specialized Tools

*   **Goose Neck Tool**: This tool has a specific profile, unlike the regular V-shaped tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Its advantage is enabling the bending of narrow channels, particularly useful in prototyping where many parts are small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Generally, a press brake can only bend a U-shape wider than its depth, but a goose neck tool allows for narrower channels by wrapping around the last bend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Deep Channel Tools**: Tools with a hole can be used to bend very deep U-shapes, allowing the depth to exceed the width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. These specialized tools are often custom-made, with cuts performed using a [[advantages_of_combining_a_press_with_a_water_jet | water jet]] to save money by cutting a long bar into desired lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Radius Tools**: For aesthetic purposes or specific designs, a set of radius tools can be used to create rounded bends instead of sharp ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This is achieved by bending a piece of scrap first and using it to give a radius to the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Magnets are often incorporated into these tools to keep them stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Adjustments and Modifications

*   **Angle Adjustment**: While press brakes come with a rear adjustment for bending less than 90 degrees, a more convenient [[modifications_for_milling_machines | modification]] is a front adjustment using an air valve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This allows for quick adjustment of the bending angle by shutting off the air earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Table for Narrow Strips**: A custom-made or purchased table with marks is useful for bending very narrow strips accurately, as it allows lining up the material with the marks instead of relying on a single stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Sliding Tube Modification for Fingers**: A highly useful [[modifications_for_milling_machines | modification]] involves adding a sliding tube over the finger guides of the press brake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This allows the inner part of the finger to be narrowed for very narrow bends, while the outer tube provides a larger resting area when the part is farther away, preventing missed fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Making Brackets

Brackets are common components that can be made rigid in several ways:

1.  **Brace Stiffener**: A simple method is to bend a brace, hold it against a square for accuracy, and then spot weld it to the bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
2.  **Triangular Stiffener**: A pre-bent triangular piece can be inserted into the bracket and spot welded, eliminating the need for a square as the triangular piece itself is square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
3.  **Integrated Rib**: For compact and stiff brackets, a rib can be bent directly into the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This is done by leaving a space between two segments on the brake and inserting a hardened steel blade with a rounded top, flush with the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This simultaneously creates the bend and a rib, providing immense stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

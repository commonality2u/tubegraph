Dan Gelbart's shop and lab is divided into four main zones: a high-precision area, a general machine shop with CNC machines, a "dirty work" room for woodworking, sanding, grinding, and welding, and a testing lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article focuses on the specialized tools and modifications found within these areas.

## High-Precision Area

The high-precision area contains equipment designed for extreme accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Moor Number 3 Jig Borer

This machine is highlighted as an "amazing machine" due to its incredible accuracy of about 1 micron or 40 millionths of an inch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Its precision extends to the orthogonality of axes, straightness of motions, calibration of micrometer lead screws, and trueness of rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The test certificate, traceable to the National Institute of Standards, shows lead screw errors as low as half a micron, which are designed to null out as the lead screws warm slightly in an oil bath during use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

The machine's construction demonstrates extreme [[Materials and construction methods for precision machinery | precision]] and care:
*   The headstock is made of Invar, a metal that does not significantly change size with temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Everything is heat-shielded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   Final scrapers wear aluminized aprons to prevent body heat from distorting the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Despite its original cost of eighty to a hundred thousand dollars, these machines can now be found on eBay for two to three thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

#### Video Microscope Accessory

A useful accessory for the jig borer is a video microscope, which helps locate features with one-micron accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. It provides a thousand-times magnified view, allowing precise alignment of the machine's axis of rotation with a target, such as a 5-micron dust speck, by minimizing run-out during rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Rotary Tables and Dividing Heads

These devices are crucial for high-precision angular work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

*   **Two-Axis Rotary Table**: Features an optical readout accurate to about one to two arc seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Ultra Dex**: Considered the most accurate device in the world for dividing accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It uses two phase gears with 360 teeth that mesh at every degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Its high accuracy (a tenth of an arc second) is achieved by averaging out high spots through repeated meshing and by the gears themselves defining the center of rotation, rather than relying on bearing accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Other Precision Tools

The area also includes a granite table with gauges, a granite square (accurate to sub-micron), an autocollimator, electronic and capacitance gauges, and air bearing glazes (further detailed in a separate video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. A watchmaker's lathe is useful for its specialized collets and gripping arrangements not found on standard lathes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, and a micro-mill is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Homemade and DIY Machine Tools (Early Shop)

To illustrate how one can start a workshop with limited funds, Gelbart shares examples from his first workshop built 50 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Sheet Metal Brake

This brake was built from a 4-inch by 0.5-inch cold-rolled steel bar and another 0.5-inch by 1.5-inch bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The parts were cut by hand, drilled, welded, and then case-hardened, allowing it to look like new almost 50 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. It features a clamping mechanism on top and two eccentrics coupled with a belt to adjust the clamping blade for different material thicknesses and bend radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This [[custom_tooling_for_bending | custom tooling for bending]] still makes clean bends on 12-gauge steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Spot Welder

Built from leftover sections of the same 4-inch by 0.5-inch steel bar, this [[homemade_and_diy_machine_tools | homemade spot welder]] exemplifies "bootstrapping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. The part with rails was built first, and then used to spot weld the housing of the machine itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## CNC Area and Lathe Modifications

The CNC area includes a Makino K55 mill and a wireless lathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### Lathe Modifications

*   **Video Microscope**: A low-cost video microscope, made from a car rear-view camera kit, is attached to the lathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. It provides at least 100x magnification, useful for aligning the tool tip when re-cutting threads or similar tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Adjustable Chuck**: A significant [[modifications_for_milling_machines | modification]] is a chuck that allows for run-out removal without losing rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Unlike commercial "grip-through" chucks that shift when clamped, this design uses a standard self-centering four-jaw chuck mounted on large, ground, and lapped steel plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Eccentrics allow the entire chuck assembly to be moved to eliminate run-out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. This means run-out can be taken out at any point along a long bar, not just at the chuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. This system is more accurate than a collet (accurate to 2-3 microns) and removes the need for collets unless working with thin-walled tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

### Manual Mill Modifications

A smaller Jet mill, primarily used as a drill, features several useful [[modifications_for_milling_machines | adaptations]]:
*   Laser center finder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   Depth stop with a sliding nut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
*   Milling/drilling vise with retractable stops inside, eliminating the need for blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
*   Standardized 3/4-inch collet size, meaning all tooling (like boring bars) has a 3/4-inch shank, saving time by avoiding collet changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) for variable speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

## Specialty Hardware Inventory

The shop maintains an extensive inventory of specialty hardware beyond easily accessible items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>:
*   **Weldable hardware**: Including standoffs, nuts, and pins, which pair well with the spot welder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. This relates to [[creating_custom_electrodes_for_specific_welding_needs | creating custom electrodes for specific welding needs]] and [[welding_techniques_for_rods_and_various_hardware | welding techniques for rods and various hardware]].
*   **Miniature rivets and eyelets**: Down to very tiny sizes, also useful for electronic work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.
*   **Scale screws**: Tiny screws where the proportions of the head to the body are like big bolts, crucial for model builders who prioritize true-to-scale details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Cut nails**: Screws where the threads were cut, not pressed, providing a better appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
*   **Low and ultra-low head socket head screws**: For specific clearance needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
*   **Undercut flat head screws**: Designed for use in thin sheet metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **Bendable metal strips**: Found in Japan, these serve as an alternative to tie wraps for holding electrical wires, allowing wires to be easily removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

## Shop Enhancements

### Anvil Modification

A simple modification to an anvil involves laminating two lead sheets to its sides using contact cement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. This effectively kills the ringing sound of the hardened steel anvil, improving [[safe_use_of_hand_tools | safe use of hand tools]] by reducing noise and potentially eliminating the need for ear protection during light use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

## Dirty Operations Room - Homemade Ovens/Furnaces

This room houses equipment for "dirty operations" like grinding and heat treating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

### Homemade Furnaces

Several ovens, mostly homemade, are used for heat treating steels and similar materials, as well as powder coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
*   **Old Workshop Oven**: An early homemade oven built 50 years ago with minimal money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. It used a converted old airplane instrument as a temperature controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.
*   **Inert Gas/Carburizing Atmosphere Oven**: This unconventional oven addresses the problem of oxidation and decarburization (carbon loss from the surface) during steel hardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Instead of expensive vacuum ovens with inert gas, it uses a methanol drip system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. Methanol drips at 5-10 drops per minute into the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. Above 400 degrees Celsius, it decomposes into a mixture of reducing gases that prevent oxidation and even add carbon to the surface, resulting in shiny parts with no carbon loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. This specific oven is designed for air-hardening tool steels and features a hot zone and a water-jacketed cold zone, allowing parts to be moved between them without opening the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. A big blue flame shoots out when the oven is opened after use due to igniting methanol vapor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>.
*   **High-Temperature Furnace for Ceramics**: A blue high-temperature furnace is used for sintering ceramics like aluminum or zirconia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. These materials are crucial when parts require very high temperature resistance, electrical insulation, or thermal insulation, and are typically machined in a soft state before sintering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

## Welding and Coating Equipment

### Induction Heater

This machine is surprisingly inexpensive (around $1,000 new) and saves considerable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. It can heat a steel bar red hot for brazing, bending, or forging in seconds, much faster than a torch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.

### Fluidized Bed Coater

Used for more critical coating applications, a fluidized bed coater contains powder that behaves like a liquid when air is pumped through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. When a hot part is dipped into the fluidized powder, the powder melts and adheres to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. The key advantage is that it coats the *inside* of hollow parts, unlike conventional powder coating which only coats the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, preventing internal rusting (e.g., in lawn furniture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.

## Testing Lab - Advanced Equipment

This room is primarily for testing and electronic work, and can function as a clean or semi-clean room due to its positive air pressure and filtered doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.

### Laser Welder

While expensive (around $20,000), a laser welder is highly useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.
*   **Versatility**: It can weld almost any metal to any other metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
*   **No Inert Gas Needed**: The weld occurs in milliseconds (up to 20 milliseconds), so fast that the metal does not oxidize, eliminating the need for inert gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.
*   **Accessibility**: Unlike traditional welders, it can weld at the bottom of deep holes because only the laser beam needs to reach the target, viewed through a microscope where the laser beam is coaxial with visible light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.
*   **Temporary Attachments**: Useful for temporarily attaching small items, such as securing nuts to screws with a tiny weld that can be sheared if needed by adjusting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>. This is superior to Loctite for high-temperature, corrosive chemical, or radiation environments as the weld is made of the same metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. The short energy deposition time makes [[welding_techniques_for_rods_and_various_hardware | welding techniques for rods and various hardware]] easier even for metals that conduct heat well, like copper to steel or silver to copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

### Other Equipment

*   **Miniature Spot Welder**: A scaled-down version of a larger spot welder, very handy for small tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.
*   **Homemade Laser Cutter and Engraver**: While built by Gelbart, he notes that commercial versions are now inexpensive enough that building one may not be worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.
*   **Diamond Wire Saw**: A [[homemade_and_diy_machine_tools | homemade]] machine similar to a bandsaw, but designed to cut glass and ceramics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. It has accessories like a chuck to hold and rotate glass for cutting round discs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. Many parts of this saw were made on a waterjet cutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>, highlighting [[modifications_to_improve_waterjet_productivity | modifications to improve waterjet productivity]] or capabilities.
*   **Electronic Test Equipment**: The lab contains a range of one-generation-old electronic test equipment, mostly for radio frequency (RF) work, including a spectrum analyzer and a network analyzer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. This older equipment is preferred for its simplicity and reliability, and importantly, its affordability on eBay (e.g., a network analyzer costing tens of thousands new can be bought for $500), making it a cost-effective way to build a sophisticated lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.

    *   **Network Analyzer (HP 3577A)**: Can perform all functions of a spectrum analyzer but also measure transfer functions of servo systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. It can plot actuator characteristics, including phase and magnitude, with incredible specs: measuring down to a microvolt, covering 5 Hz to 200 MHz, and measuring phase to a fraction of a degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>. This represents a significant investment in [[high_precision_machinery_and_applications | high precision machinery and applications]].

Polycarbonate is a widely used engineering plastic, primarily known under the trade name [[challenges_of_forming_lexan_plastic | Lexan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It is considered the most useful engineering plastic for general R&D work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Key Properties

Polycarbonates are described as "amazing materials" due to several key characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>:
*   **Shatter-proof** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>
*   **Ductile** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>: A 3/16 inch polycarbonate sheet can be bent like sheet metal without breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It does exhibit some spring-back after bending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, but this can be accounted for by bending it slightly sharper than the desired angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Limitations and Solutions

While versatile, polycarbonate, like all plastics, has inherent limitations that require specific considerations during design and use.

### Thread Holding
Polycarbonate is generally too weak to hold threads directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Solution 1: Threaded Inserts** Threaded inserts, similar to pop rivets, can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Solution 2: Helicoils** If space is limited for inserts, helicoils (small metal springs that form a thread) can be threaded into the material to provide an excellent thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Material Stability and Thermal Expansion
Polycarbonates, and plastics in general, are considered unstable materials unless heavily filled with fibers or other fillers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Humidity Absorption**: They absorb humidity and change properties with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Temperature Sensitivity**: They soften with temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **High Thermal Expansion**: Plastics have a significantly larger thermal expansion coefficient compared to [[properties_and_uses_of_different_metals_particularly_stainless_steel | metals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Typical coefficients for plastics range from 50 to 150 (parts per million per degree), which is almost an order of magnitude higher than metals (10-23 ppm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This can cause buckling if a plastic sheet is bolted tightly to a metal sheet and exposed to temperature changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Thermal Expansion
> A thermal expansion of 100 PPM over a meter translates to 0.1 mm per degree Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. A 10-degree temperature change can result in 1 mm of expansion, which is a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

*   **Solution for Thermal Expansion**: To accommodate expansion, parts should ideally be mounted with one side fixed and the other side utilizing a slot with a washer, allowing movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Applications

Despite their instability and thermal expansion issues, polycarbonates and other plastics are essential when specific properties are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>:
*   Heat insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>
*   Electrical insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
*   Transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>

Polycarbonate, commonly known by its trade name [[properties_and_challenges_of_working_with_lexan | Lexan]], is considered the most useful engineering plastic for general research and development (R&D) work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It is a highly versatile material known for several key properties.

## Properties of Polycarbonate

*   **Shatterproof and Ductile** Polycarbonate is remarkably shatterproof and ductile, allowing it to be bent like sheet metal without breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While it does exhibit some spring-back, this can be compensated for by bending it sharper than the desired angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Thread Holding Weakness** Unlike metals, polycarbonate is generally too weak to reliably hold threads on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Material Instability** Like most [[characteristics_and_applications_of_various_plastics | plastics]] (unless heavily filled with materials like fibers), polycarbonate is an unstable material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    *   It absorbs humidity, which can cause changes in its properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   It softens significantly with temperature increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   It has a much larger thermal expansion coefficient compared to [[properties_and_uses_of_mild_steel_and_stainless_steel | metals]], typically ranging from 50 to 150 parts per million (PPM), which is almost an order of magnitude higher than metals (e.g., steel ~11 ppm, aluminum ~23 ppm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Uses in Engineering

Polycarbonate is chosen for specific applications where its properties are advantageous, such as:
*   **Heat Insulation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>
*   **Electrical Insulation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
*   **Transparency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>

However, due to its instability and thermal expansion, it's often preferable to avoid its use if possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges with Polycarbonate

### Threading Solutions
To overcome the issue of polycarbonate not holding threads directly, engineers commonly employ two methods:
*   **Threaded Inserts** These inserts are set into the polycarbonate much like pop rivets, providing a strong internal thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Helicoils** If space is limited, helicoils can be used. These are small metal springs that form a thread when screwed into a plain hole, offering an excellent thread for fasteners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Once proper threading is achieved, the polycarbonate part becomes highly usable, similar to a metal component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Managing Thermal Expansion
The significant thermal expansion of polycarbonate can cause issues, such as buckling when a plastic sheet is rigidly bolted to a metal sheet and exposed to temperature changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. A 100 PPM expansion over a meter results in a 0.1 mm change per degree Celsius, meaning a 1 mm expansion over 10 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

To mitigate this, it is recommended to mount one side of a large polycarbonate sheet with a fixed screw and the other side with a slot and washer to allow for expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The issues with plastic materials, including polycarbonate, are significant challenges in [[challenges_with_plastic_materials_in_prototyping | prototyping]] and long-term applications, primarily due to their instability related to humidity and temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Many everyday devices require springs, which come in numerous forms and are often needed in a specific shape that may not be readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. It is very easy and efficient to make your own springs directly from spring wire, often taking less time than searching for a pre-made one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Stocking just three or four sizes of spring wire allows for the instant creation of both compression and tension springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## How to Make Springs

The process of creating a spring is straightforward:
1.  **Winding**: Grip the spring wire in a chuck along with a mandrel. You can bend the wire slightly or grip it directly with the mandrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Start winding slowly, then maintain a grip and allow the machine to coil the wire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
2.  **Cutting**: Once wound, cut the spring off. Exercise caution to avoid injury from the spring swinging around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
3.  **Finishing Ends**:
    *   **Tension Springs**: To finish a tension spring, you can simply bend the ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. An even faster method is to separate one turn of the coil and bend it at a 90-degree angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
    *   **Compression Springs**: To create a compression spring, take a tension spring, overstretch it slightly, and then cut off the ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## Types of Spring Wire

Two main types of spring wire are commonly used:

### Music Wire
*   Music wire is a carbon steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   It is the cheapest option available in all sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   A key characteristic is that it is not rust-proof or corrosion-resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### 17-7 Stainless Steel
*   This alloy is recommended when corrosion resistance is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   It is available in all wire sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Heat Treatment**: Unlike the [[materials_used_for_flexures_and_their_properties | 17-7 stainless steel sheet]], which requires a double-heating cycle, the wire form metallurgically only needs one heating cycle for hardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. After winding the spring, it should be placed in an oven. Typical manufacturer instructions suggest heating it to 480Â°C (Celcius) for one hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Always follow the manufacturer's specific instructions for heat cycle, as different tempers or annealing processes may vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

By having these materials on hand, custom springs can be made quickly and efficiently for various applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

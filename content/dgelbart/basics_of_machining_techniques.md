This article briefly covers some fundamental aspects of machining, including drilling, deburring, and different hole-making methods, as well as considerations for milling operations. There are many comprehensive resources available for in-depth machining knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Drilling a Hole

To drill an accurate hole, a center punch is typically used to guide the drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

*   **Accurate Center Punch Placement**
    *   **Scribing Lines:** To place a center punch accurately, you usually start by scribing lines on the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This can be done with any sharp tool, such as a scriber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
    *   **Using Feel:** The most important technique is to locate the center punch by feel, not by sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Slide the punch along the surface until you feel it lock into the intersection of the scribed lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
    *   **Making the Mark:** First, make a light center mark, then reinforce it with a larger center mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    *   **Punch Sharpness:** Center punches must be very sharp, typically sharpened at a 90-degree tip angle, to effectively feel the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
    *   **Improving Visibility:** If lines are hard to see, use a layout fluid like a razor ball marker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Apply it over the area, and the lines will become clearly visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. After locating the punch, it can be wiped off instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

*   **Multi-Step Drilling for Precision**
    *   For very precise or large holes, begin with a smaller diameter hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
    *   The reason for this is that a larger drill's web (the central part of the drill bit) is wider than the center mark, preventing the drill from centering itself accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. A smaller drill will center itself on the mark, and then the full-size drill can follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Deburring

After drilling, it's good practice to deburr the hole while the workpiece is still set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

*   **External Deburring:**
    *   A countersink tool is commonly used to remove burrs from the top surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   Specialized deburring tools, designed for bearing holes, can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. If the tool leaves a large burr, it may indicate the drill bit wasn't sharp enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Internal Deburring (Hard-to-Reach Areas):**
    *   For deburring inside pipes or boxes where conventional tools cannot reach, a tool resembling a wood chisel, sharpened at a dull angle (80-90 degrees) and slightly rounded, can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
    *   Insert the tool almost parallel to the surface at a slight angle and tap it with a hammer to shear off internal burrs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Hole Making Methods (Drill Press or Milling Machine)

There are three primary ways to create a hole using a drill press or milling machine: drilling, reaming, and boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Drilling

*   Drilling is the initial and often least accurate method for hole creation, as discussed above.

### [[Reaming and Boring Processes | Reaming]]

[[Reaming and Boring Processes | Reaming]] is a process used to create more accurate diameters and better surface finishes than drilling, particularly important for applications like bearing fits or shafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

*   **Steps for [[Reaming and Boring Processes | Reaming]]:**
    1.  **Center Drill:** Begin with a rigid center drill to start the hole accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    2.  **Undersized Drill:** Use an undersized drill bit, typically 0.1 to 0.2 millimeters smaller than the final desired diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    3.  **Zero Readout:** If using an electronic readout, zero it before drilling to allow easy return to position if handles are accidentally bumped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
    4.  **Lubrication:** Apply cutting oil or wax to the reamer, especially for materials like aluminum which can stick to the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    5.  **Low Speed:** Operate the reamer at a low speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    6.  **Reamer Flexibility:** Do not worry about run-out, as the reamer is flexible and will find its own center within the hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Result:** A well-[[Reaming and Boring Processes | reamed]] hole provides a nice, tight fit for components like a dowel pin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Fitting Precise Shafts:** When inserting a precise shaft into a precise hole, binding often occurs due to fundamental geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. To avoid this, machine a recess on the shaft: leave one millimeter of the full diameter, followed by a groove a few millimeters wide, then the full diameter again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This narrow link allows tilting, preventing binding, and the second full-diameter section self-aligns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This trick is crucial for large shafts and bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Limitation:** Reamers are slightly tapered, meaning they generally do not work in blind holes because they require going all the way through to achieve accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### [[Reaming and Boring Processes | Boring]]

[[Reaming and Boring Processes | Boring]] is comparable in accuracy to [[Reaming and Boring Processes | reaming]] but offers variable size control and is particularly suitable for large or blind holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

*   **Using a Boring Head:** A boring head is used for this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Machine Rigidity:** Unlike drilling (which has two flutes to balance forces), [[Reaming and Boring Processes | boring]] uses a single-point cutting action, making machine rigidity very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The machine must be locked, and tool overhang minimized, with everything tight and rigid, to prevent deflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Adjusting Diameter:** The diameter is adjusted on the boring head itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Capabilities:** [[Reaming and Boring Processes | Boring]] allows machining to a specific step, unlike [[Reaming and Boring Processes | reaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. It produces a high [[high accuracy in machining | accuracy]] hole suitable for shafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## Milling from Solid

Sometimes, a housing or part needs to be completely milled from a solid block, especially when specific features like light-tight labyrinth seals or precision machine references are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

*   **Milling Cutter Types:**
    *   **Ball Nose Cutter:** Has a round nose, removes metal much faster than regular cutters, and is less prone to breakage due to the absence of a sharp edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
    *   **Regular Cutter:** Has a sharp edge, more prone to breakage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
    *   **Design for Round Corners:** If sharp internal corners are not critical, always specify or design for round corners to allow the use of a ball nose cutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Milling Stiffness and Design Considerations:**
    *   The speed and [[high accuracy in machining | accuracy]] of milling are directly related to the stiffness of the mill, which determines how much it can deflect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
    *   **Stiffness Formula:** Stiffness is proportional to D^4 / L^3 (diameter to the power of four divided by length to the power of three) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This means a mill twice the diameter and half the length can be 128 times stiffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
    *   **Design Principle:** Always design parts to allow for the biggest diameter and shortest mill possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
    *   **Housing Design:** If possible, split housings in the middle rather than at a deep pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. A deeper housing would require a longer, less stiff mill (e.g., twice as deep makes it eight times less stiff) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Designing around these tool considerations is key to efficient milling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **[[CNC Programming and Clamping Strategies | CNC Programming and Clamping Strategies]]:**
    *   **Minimize Clampings:** A crucial aspect of milling is minimizing the number of times the workpiece needs to be clamped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
    *   **Accuracy Loss:** Re-clamping a workpiece causes a loss of [[high accuracy in machining | accuracy]] because features are no longer registered to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
    *   **Efficiency:** [[CNC Programming and Clamping Strategies | CNC machines]] can operate for hours, but they cannot re-clamp the workpiece themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
    *   **Smart Clamping:**
        *   Even with six surfaces, it's possible to mill many sides with just two clampings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
        *   For even greater efficiency, consider adding [[unique_machine_components_and_design | tooling holes]] (e.g., two holes for T-nuts in T-slots) in areas where they won't interfere with the final design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This can allow five out of six sides to be machined in a single clamping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
    *   Minimizing clamping and maximizing mill stiffness are fundamental to effective [[CNC Programming and Clamping Strategies | CNC programming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

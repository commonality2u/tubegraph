Vacuum forming is a technique used to shape plastics by heating a sheet of plastic and then quickly moving it over a mold while applying a vacuum to pull the plastic down to conform to the mold's shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This process takes approximately one second to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Process Overview
To perform vacuum forming, a plastic sheet is heated, typically in an oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Once heated, it is quickly moved over a bottom mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. A top frame is used to clamp the plastic sheet to prevent its ends from pulling in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The vacuum then spreads around the mold, including corners, to pull the plastic down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. After forming, the plastic must be allowed to cool down, especially for normal plastics which can distort if removed too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Materials
While many plastics work well with vacuum forming, material choice significantly impacts the outcome.

### Suitable Plastics
Plastics like PVC, ABS, and polyethylene are generally suitable for vacuum forming and will pull down to form beautifully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. These materials remain soft longer after heating, allowing for complete cooling on the mold to prevent distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### [[challenges_of_forming_lexan_plastic | Challenges of Forming Lexan Plastic]]
[[choosing_and_using_plastics_in_prototyping | Lexan]] is a very difficult material for vacuum forming because it does not soften easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> and becomes hard quickly as soon as it cools down a little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Despite its difficulty in forming, Lexan is strong and shatterproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Unlike other plastics, Lexan hardens while still very hot, meaning it can be removed from the mold sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Equipment Needed
For vacuum forming, the essential components are:
*   **Bottom Mold:** The shape that the plastic will conform to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. No complex features like grooves are needed for vacuum spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Top Frame:** Used to clamp the plastic sheet securely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Heated Sheet of Plastic:** The material to be formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Vacuum Source:** To create the necessary suction for forming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

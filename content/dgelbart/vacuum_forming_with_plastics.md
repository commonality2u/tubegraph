Vacuum forming is a technique used to shape plastics by heating a sheet of plastic and then quickly moving it over a mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This can also be achieved by heating the plastic in an oven before moving it over the mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The process itself is very quick, taking only about one second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Material Considerations

### Difficult Materials
Lexan is a challenging material for vacuum forming because it does not soften easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It hardens quickly as soon as it cools down a little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, which can prevent it from pulling down all the way over the mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. However, Lexan's advantage is its strength and shatterproof nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Suitable Materials
Other plastics like PVC, ABS, and polyethylene are much more suitable for vacuum forming and will pull down beautifully to form the desired shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Required Components for Vacuum Forming

To perform vacuum forming, you need:
*   **A bottom mold** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The vacuum will spread around the mold, so there is no need to make grooves or other features for air flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **A top frame** to clamp the plastic sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This prevents the ends of the plastic from pulling in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **A heated sheet of plastic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Cooling and Handling

After forming, the plastic needs to cool down.
*   For normal plastics, it's crucial to leave the part on the mold until it has completely cooled down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. If removed too early, the plastic can still distort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, as it stays soft for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   Lexan, despite being very hot, hardens quickly, allowing it to be removed sooner than other plastics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

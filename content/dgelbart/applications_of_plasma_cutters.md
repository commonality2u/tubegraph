A plasma cutter is a less expensive and less versatile alternative to a [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | waterjet cutter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It typically costs about one-tenth of a [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | waterjet cutter]] and has one-tenth of the operating cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Capabilities and Limitations
Plasma cutters are primarily designed to cut metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. They can cut stainless steel and aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. However, they are not effective for cutting non-metallic materials, copper, or materials that conduct heat away very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. While smaller units can cut up to a quarter-inch of steel, larger plasma cutters can handle steel up to three-quarters of an inch thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

The quality of the cut with a plasma cutter, particularly when used freehand, is generally not as precise as a [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | waterjet cutter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. However, when mounted on a CNC table, the cut quality improves significantly and is considered "quite nice" and "completely acceptable for sheet metal work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Common Applications

Plasma cutters are useful for various tasks, particularly for "quick and dirty work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Cutting Holes in Large Enclosures
One key application is cutting holes in large items, such as car parts or cabinets, that are too large to fit into a [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | waterjet cutter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. In such cases, a template can be cut using a [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | waterjet cutter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This oversized template accounts for the plasma cutter's nozzle diameter and is then clamped to the workpiece, allowing the plasma torch to follow it for a well-defined cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Sheet Metal Work
When operated on a CNC table, plasma cutters provide a sufficiently clean cut for [[efficient_fabrication_methods_using_water_jets | sheet metal work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Operational Considerations
Plasma cutters, such as those made by Torch Mate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, are lightweight and require only compressed air and standard household power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
When using a plasma cutter, it's crucial to wear goggles that filter intense UV radiation, as sparks and UV light are emitted during operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

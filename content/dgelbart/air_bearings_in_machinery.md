Air bearings are a critical component in [[High precision machinery and applications | high-precision machinery]] due to their unique properties that eliminate physical contact, leading to minimal [[The Role of Lubrication in Reducing Wear in High Accuracy Parts | wear]] and [[The Role of Lubrication in Reducing Wear in High Accuracy Parts | lubrication]] requirements.

## Principles and Properties

An air bearing functions similarly to a self-acting air bearing, allowing parts to spin freely as if on traditional ball [[mounting_techniques_for_pulley_and_bearings | bearings]], but without mechanical contact [00:01:09]. This non-contact operation is the fundamental principle behind their advantages [00:01:28].

Key properties of air bearings include:
*   **No [[The Role of Lubrication in Reducing Wear in High Accuracy Parts | Lubrication]] Needed**: Since there is no physical contact between the inner and outer parts, air bearings never need [[The Role of Lubrication in Reducing Wear in High Accuracy Parts | lubrication]] [00:01:23].
*   **No [[The Role of Lubrication in Reducing Wear in High Accuracy Parts | Wear]]**: The absence of contact also means that air bearings will never [[The Role of Lubrication in Reducing Wear in High Accuracy Parts | wear]] out [00:01:26].
*   **[[creating_airtight_and_frictionless_parts | Frictionless]] Operation**: Parts fitted with air bearings can spin [[creating_airtight_and_frictionless_parts | frictionlessly]] for extended periods [00:01:19].
*   **Airtightness**: Extremely [[Techniques for Measuring and Ensuring Precision in Mechanical Parts | accurate]] parts made possible by such machines can also be [[creating_airtight_and_frictionless_parts | airtight]] [00:01:02].
*   **Noise**: Air bearings can be a bit noisy when in operation [00:04:33].

This concept is similar to air bearings found in hard drives and other self-acting air bearing devices [00:01:35].

## Applications in a High-Precision Lathe and Grinder

In a scratch-built, very [[High precision machinery and applications | high-precision]] lathe and grinder capable of cutting, turning, and grinding parts to a tolerance of one micron (40 millionths of an inch) [00:00:09], air bearings are extensively used.

Components utilizing air bearings in this machine include:
*   The tail stock [00:03:53].
*   The entire saddle [00:04:36].
*   The cross slide [00:04:39].
*   The main spindle [00:04:42].
*   The grinding spindle [00:04:45].

While many parts of the machine are built from scratch, the air bearings for the main spindle and grinding spindle were acquired as surplus semiconductor machinery units [00:04:50]. These units are relatively inexpensive, often available for a few hundred dollars each, because a significant amount of machinery in the semiconductor industry is air bearing-based [00:05:07].

### Example of Precision Parts

An example of a part that requires such [[Techniques for Measuring and Ensuring Precision in Mechanical Parts | accuracy]] is a cylinder and piston assembly [00:00:39]. When made on this machine, the piston provides a complete sliding fit that is entirely loose [00:00:51]. However, when the air vent is sealed, it becomes completely [[creating_airtight_and_frictionless_parts | airtight]] [00:00:58]. Furthermore, when spun, it rotates [[creating_airtight_and_frictionless_parts | frictionlessly]] and freely, like a self-acting air bearing [00:01:05]. Parts like these come straight off the machine without needing time-consuming lapping [00:01:56].

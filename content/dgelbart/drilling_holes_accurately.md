Achieving [[high accuracy in machining | accurate]] holes in machining requires careful preparation, specific techniques, and an understanding of tool behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Preparation for Drilling

### Center Punching and Scribing
To guide the drill accurately, you typically [[Press tooling and alignment techniques | center punch]] the desired location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This is usually done by scribing lines and laying out the pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Locating the Center by Feel
The key to accurately placing a center punch is to locate the intersection of scribed lines by *feel*, rather than by sight, as feel is much more [[high accuracy in machining | accurate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. You slide the scribe until you feel it "lock in place" at the crossing of the lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Once locked, press to make a light center mark, then reinforce it with a larger mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Sharpening Center Punches
Center punches must be very sharp, typically sharpened at about a 90-degree tip angle, to allow you to feel the scribed lines effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Using Layout Fluid
If scribed lines are difficult to see, you can apply a razor ball marker or layout fluid over the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This makes the lines much more visible for orientation, and the fluid can be wiped off instantly afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Drilling Techniques

### Pilot Holes for Precision
For a very [[High precision machining techniques | precise]] hole, or when drilling large sizes, always start with a smaller diameter pilot hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Reasoning**: A larger drill's web width can be wider than the center punch mark, preventing it from centering itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. A smaller drill will center itself on the mark, allowing the full-size drill to follow accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Guidance**: You can align the pilot hole visually or with a [[Laser center finders for machine alignment | laser finder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Using a Center Drill
When starting to drill, especially if you haven't center punched, begin with a center drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Center drills are very rigid and will not wander off course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Zeroing Electronic Readouts
It's good practice to zero your electronic readouts on the [[Drill Mill and Milling Vice setup | drill press]] or [[Drill Mill and Milling Vice setup | milling machine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This allows you to return to the zero point if the handles are accidentally bumped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Post-Drilling Processes for Accuracy and Finish

### Deburring
After drilling, it's important to deburr the hole while the workpiece is still set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **External Deburring**: Use a countersink tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> or a dedicated deburring tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. A large burr might indicate a dull drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Internal Deburring (Blind Areas)**: For internal deburring where tools can't reach, like inside a pipe, use a tool resembling a wood chisel, sharpened at a dull angle (80-90 degrees) and slightly rounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Position it almost parallel to the surface at a slight angle and tap with a hammer to shear off burrs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Reaming
[[Reaming and Boring Processes | Reaming]] is a more [[high accuracy in machining | accurate]] process than drilling, improving both diameter and surface finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Preparation**: Drill an undersized hole, typically 0.1 to 0.2 millimeters smaller than the final desired diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Technique**: Apply cutting oil or wax to the reamer, especially for aluminum, which can stick to the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Operate at low speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Don't worry about run-out, as the reamer is flexible and will find its own place in the hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. [[Reaming and Boring Processes | Reamers]] are tapered and require a through-hole to achieve full accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Boring
[[Reaming and Boring Processes | Boring]] offers comparable accuracy to [[Reaming and Boring Processes | reaming]] but allows for variable hole sizes and is especially suitable for large or blind holes where reamers cannot be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Rigidity is Key**: When [[Reaming and Boring Processes | boring]], machine rigidity is crucial due to the single-point cutting action, which lacks the balancing forces of a drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The machine must be locked, and the quill overhang minimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Process**: Adjust the diameter with the boring head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. For aluminum, a faster speed can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Boring allows machining to a step and does not require going through the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Achieving Precise Shaft Fits

When inserting a very [[High precision machining techniques | precise]] shaft into a very [[High precision machining techniques | precise]] hole, binding is a common issue due to fundamental geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Solution**: Machine a recess or groove into the shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Leave about one millimeter of the full diameter, followed by a several-millimeter-wide groove, and then resume the full diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: This creates a narrow contact point that allows for tilting, preventing locking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. By the time the shaft reaches the second correct diameter, it self-aligns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This trick can save significant time, especially with large shafts and bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Milling Considerations for Accuracy

When [[Drill Mill and Milling Vice setup | milling]] parts, especially from solid material for applications like light-tight housings with [[High precision machining techniques | precision]] machined references, several factors influence accuracy and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Milling Cutter Types
*   **Ball Nose Cutter**: Has a rounded nose. Removes metal faster and is less prone to breakage than regular cutters because it lacks a sharp edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. If sharp internal corners are not strictly necessary, specify or design for round corners to utilize ball nose cutters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Regular Cutters**: Have sharp edges.

### Mill Stiffness
The stiffness of the [[Drill Mill and Milling Vice setup | mill]] dictates how fast and [[high accuracy in machining | accurately]] you can machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Formula**: Stiffness is proportional to D^4/L^3, where D is the diameter and L is the length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Doubling the diameter and halving the length increases stiffness by 128 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Design Implications**: Design parts to allow for the biggest diameter and shortest [[Drill Mill and Milling Vice setup | mill]] possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. For instance, leave the largest possible radius in corners if a tight corner isn't needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

### Housing Design
When designing housings for [[Drill Mill and Milling Vice setup | milling]], try to split them roughly in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Avoid splitting them into a deep housing and a thin top, as a deeper housing requires a longer [[Drill Mill and Milling Vice setup | mill]], which is much less stiff (e.g., twice as deep means eight times less stiff) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

### Clamping and Tooling Holes
Minimizing the number of [[Press tooling and alignment techniques | clampings]] is critical for maintaining accuracy, as reclamping loses registration between features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Plan [[Press tooling and alignment techniques | clampings]] cleverly. For example, two [[Press tooling and alignment techniques | clampings]] can cover multiple sides of a part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   **Tooling Holes**: Consider designing in temporary "tooling holes" or [[Press tooling and alignment techniques | clamping]] holes in non-critical areas of the blank part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. These can be used with screws into T-nuts in the T-slots, allowing up to five out of six sides to be machined in a single [[Press tooling and alignment techniques | clamping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. This significantly aids accuracy and automation with CNC machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

While somewhat exotic, laser welders offer significant advantages in fabrication, particularly when creating assemblies that mimic castings but require diverse material properties or precise application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. They are considered versatile machines, though they can be a luxury item with costs around $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## Key Advantages

*   **Access to Difficult Areas**
    Laser welders can reach very hard-to-access places, as long as the location can be seen through a microscope and light can reach it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

*   **Welding Dissimilar Metals**
    A major benefit is their ability to weld dissimilar metals together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. The laser welder does not discriminate based on the metal type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>, allowing combinations such as aluminum to steel or silver to lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. This contrasts with traditional welding methods, which typically cannot join materials like steel and brass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

*   **Minimal Oxidation and Distortion**
    Due to the extremely fast pulse of the laser, there is little chance for trouble or oxidation to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. They can weld without an inert atmosphere, as even regular steel doesn't oxidize during the rapid weld process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. This speed contributes to less distortion compared to other welding methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

*   **Temporary or Permanent Joins**
    Laser welds can be used for temporary tacking of parts, allowing for repositioning or subsequent processes like brazing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. These temporary welds can be broken if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. For securing components during multi-step processes like brazing, being [[Laser welding advantages | laser welded]] ensures parts do not fall off when turned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.

Laser welding offers a valuable alternative to [[Brazing versus welding | traditional welding]] for intricate or multi-material fabrication, enhancing versatility in product design and assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. For simple tacking, a [[Spot Welding and Repairing Errors in Metal Prototypes | spot welder]] can also be used, though not for brazing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

While widely recognized for the lightbulb, Thomas Edison's most original invention, which emerged "out of nowhere," was the phonograph, also known as the gramophone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. This device marked a groundbreaking moment in history, allowing individuals for the first time to hear their own voice or recorded music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:07]</a>. Before the phonograph, people could see their reflection or have their likeness painted, but there was no way to capture or playback sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

## Historical Context: Edison's Lightbulb

Before delving into the phonograph, it's important to understand Edison's contribution to the lightbulb, which, while significant, was an improvement upon existing ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

*   **Pre-Edison Electric Lighting**: Houses were lit with electric lighting before Edison, notably in England, where Joseph Swan already had lightbulbs on sale and houses lit by them a couple of years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   **The Series Problem**: Earlier lightbulbs had to be wired in series and worked on low voltage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. This meant if one bulb burned out, all the lights in the house would go out, similar to old Christmas tree lights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   **Edison's Innovation**: Edison was the first to understand and implement a system where lightbulbs were connected in parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. He realized this was key to successfully selling an electrical lighting system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. He achieved this by finding a carbon filament with very high resistance, allowing the lightbulb to be plugged into a 220-volt system (originally DC, later AC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. His work vastly contributed to the lightbulb and the distribution of electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

## The Invention of the Phonograph

The phonograph, invented in 1877, just before the lightbulb, was Edison's most original and "magic-like" invention, as it had no real precedent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.

### How it Worked

The machine operated by engraving a cylinder based on the vibrations of sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

*   **Cylinder Material**: The original cylinders in Edison's machine were made of tinfoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. Later, Alexander Graham Bell and his associates improved upon this by changing the cylinder material to wax, which was more durable and easier to engrave and playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.
*   **Playback Mechanism**: A wax cylinder rotated, and a diamond needle followed the engraved groove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. The entire process was mechanical, requiring no electricity, and a large horn was used to amplify the sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

### Recording Capability

A notable feature of the phonograph was its ability to record, not just playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. By singing into the machine, it could scribe the wax and record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. The only difference between recording and playback was the needle: a sharper needle was sold specifically for recording, and a different one for playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. These needles were easily interchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. For optimal use, it was better to have two heads, one for recording and one for playback, to prevent simultaneous recording of music and speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

### Popularity and Legacy

The phonograph was immensely popular from its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. Millions of machines and cylinders were produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. Even today, a vast array of music, including specific genres like Klezmer music, can still be found on Edison cylinders, often discovered in attics where they were stored for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

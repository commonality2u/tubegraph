It is possible to create an emergency left-hand tap using a standard right-hand tap, especially when a specialized left-hand tap is unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Grinding the Tap

The process involves modifying a right-hand tap to allow it to cut in reverse:
*   **Flattening the tap** Grind the right-hand tap completely flat, leaving only a central section that is approximately one-third of the tap's original diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Adding rake angles (optional)** For improved tapping performance, two grooves can be ground into the flattened section using a hand grinder. These grooves create a rake angle for the cutting edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Even after these modifications, the tool is still technically a right-hand tap, but its narrowed lands enable it to function as a left-hand tap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Tapping Procedure

1.  **Drill the hole** First, drill the appropriate size hole for the thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
2.  **Insert the modified tap** Place the newly modified tap into the drilled hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
3.  **Apply cutting fluid** Add a small amount of cutting fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
4.  **Reverse the drill** The critical step is to run the drill in reverse, opposite to the usual direction, to cut a left-hand thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

By running the drill backwards, a perfect left-hand thread can be cut using the modified right-hand tap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This can be verified by threading in a left-hand threaded stud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> For general drilling operations, it's often recommended to use a center punch and a center drill before the main drill bit to ensure accuracy and prevent wandering, especially on sloped surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. However, there are [[drill_press_time_saving_techniques | time-saving techniques]] where these initial steps can be skipped. For instance, pecking a few times quickly with the drill can help create a starting point and prevent the drill from wandering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

While not every small shop has a press, this machine offers numerous useful applications, particularly when combined with a [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The synergy between these two machines lies in the [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet]]'s ability to quickly cut custom tooling for the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Press Safety Precautions

Presses are considered one of the most dangerous machines in a shop due to their deceptive appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
It's crucial to understand two primary dangers:

### Danger of Stored Energy and Shattering
When steel is compressed, it stores a significant amount of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. If the material is brittle, it can suddenly shatter, releasing all this energy at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. A block of steel compressed near its strength limit can store more energy than a bent truck spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. If a piece of steel under 100 tons of force shatters, it can release energy far exceeding that of a rifle cartridge, potentially causing instant fatality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Due to the Poisson ratio, forces are not just vertical but also sideways, causing pieces to fly like shrapnel in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

> **Rule 1: Never press a hardened or brittle piece of material.** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
> If done, it is guaranteed to shatter, turning into shrapnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

Even when pressing ductile materials, tooling may be hardened, posing a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The press itself is hardened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

> **Safety Measure:** Always provide a shield made of half-inch polycarbonate, which is shatterproof, for any operation except pressing sheet metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Danger of Concentrated Force on Small Areas
Applying full force to a very small piece of material, like a dime, can damage the press itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Concentrating 100 tons of force on an area of approximately 2 square centimeters exceeds the yield strength of even the best steel (50 tons/cm² vs. typical yield of 10-20 tons/cm²) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This can dent or even crack the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

> **Rule 2:** To ensure safety, a 100-ton press should not be loaded more than about 10 tons per square centimeter, meaning the applied force should not be on an area less than 10 square centimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Applications and Benefits of Combining a Press with a Water Jet

While a press is primarily useful for straightening and flattening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, its capabilities are greatly expanded when paired with a [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Rapid Tooling Creation
The primary advantage is the ability to quickly cut custom tooling on the [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet]] from a plate of mild steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This allows for the pressing of special shapes in sheet metal within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
This method is significantly faster than using a CNC mill to create patterns, as it avoids clamping and complex setup issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Two pieces can be cut on the [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet]], spot welded, and ready in about 5 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### [[creating_lightweight_structures_with_a_press | Creating Lightweight, High-Performance Structures]]
Presses are essential for creating lightweight, high-performance structures, especially for applications like airborne components where stiffness is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Stiffness in lightweight structures is best achieved using closed-form pieces, similar to how a car gains rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

*   **Ribs for Stiffness:** Pressing a rib into a flat strip of metal significantly increases its moment of inertia and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Closed Shapes for Torsional Strength:** While simple bends improve bending strength, a closed shape (e.g., two pressed ribs spot-welded together) provides both bending and torsional stiffness with the same weight as a flat piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Material Considerations:** For high-performance structures, certain stainless steels (e.g., 17-7 stainless) that can be heat-treated after forming are ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. These materials can be pressed, spot-welded, and then hardened through a simple heat treatment cycle in an oven, resulting in a very high elastic range that allows them to spring back even after bending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

For instance, reinforcing a lightweight electronic enclosure cover can involve cutting two layers (an X-shape with tabs and a backing layer) on the [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet]], spot-welding them, and then pressing the desired shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### Producing Cylindrical Box Covers
A press is also vital for manufacturing cylindrical boxes or drums, specifically for creating the round covers with a bent-up lip for spot welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet]] can simultaneously produce both male and female tooling for these shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

*   **Tooling Clearance:** When creating male and female tooling, a clearance of about 1.5 to 2 mm is necessary for a 1mm thick material to prevent jamming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   After pressing, the edges may be rough and require sanding for a clean finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Pressing Techniques and Tool Alignment

A critical aspect of pressing with male and female tooling is alignment, especially when sheet metal is between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Misalignment can damage both the tool and the workpiece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Two-Method Pressing for Ribs
1.  **Against Rubber/Lead (Rough Shape):** A male tool, cut on the [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet]], can be pressed against very hard rubber or polyurethane (or lead) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This method creates a nice rib but with less sharp definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. The rubber/lead must be larger than the metal piece to prevent wrinkling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
2.  **Male and Female Tooling (Sharp Definition):** Once a rough shape is pressed, it can then be used to register the male and female halves of the tooling, allowing for a much sharper and more defined press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

For a single-step press with sharp detail, pressing into lead is effective, and the lead can be melted and reused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

### Deep Drawing and Annealing
For deep drawing or creating very complex shapes, multiple steps may be required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This often involves:
1.  Drawing the shape with a smaller die.
2.  Annealing the material (heating it to red hot and letting it cool down) to restore ductility.
3.  Then drawing it further with a larger die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
Attempting a very deep draw in one step can cause the material to tear <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

### Pressing vs. Shearing
There is a fine line between pressing and shearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. If steel tooling has sharp, unrounded corners, it might shear the material rather than just pressing a shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. To punch out many parts, a hardened tool with sharp corners can be pressed into rubber or lead to shear the part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

The design and fabrication of enclosures are a primary application for the techniques covered in this course, particularly leveraging the advantages of [[waterjet cutting | waterjet cutting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This approach is highly beneficial for [[prototyping | prototyping]] and even limited production runs, focusing on rapid construction using easily mastered equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Design Principles for Enclosures

### Captive Hardware and Accessibility
For R&D work, enclosures are often designed with all captive hardware, meaning no screws need to be fully removed to open them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Snap-in Covers:** Covers can be designed to snap into place without screws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Pre-cut Knockouts:** Knockouts, similar to those found in electrical boxes, can be cut directly into the design to eliminate the need for later drilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Keyholes:** Wherever possible, keyholes are preferred over regular holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This is a significant time-saver, as it avoids the need to remove screws entirely and prevents screws from falling into sensitive parts of the machine, potentially causing shorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. These features come at no additional cost when using [[waterjet cutting | waterjet cutting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Lightweight and Strong Designs
To create lightweight and strong enclosures, parts can be embossed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Ribs can be added in approximately one minute using a die that was itself made on the [[waterjet cutting | waterjet cutting]] machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This die consists of two spot-welded pieces, also cut by [[waterjet cutting | waterjet cutting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### [[advantages_of_ushaped_design_in_metalwork | U-Shaped Construction]]
A common design preference is to construct boxes from U-shaped pieces rather than attempting to bend a single piece on all four sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. For example, a box might be made from one large U-shape and two smaller U-shapes that are then spot-welded together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

This preference for U-shaped components offers significant advantages in the bending process:
*   **Ease of Bending:** [[advantages_of_ushaped_design_in_metalwork | U-shaped pieces]] can be bent on a brake press without needing to reposition segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Bending a single, four-sided piece would require adjusting brake segments to fit, which adds several minutes to the process to find the correct combination of brake fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Efficiency:** With a U-shape, a full-length bar can be used for bending without modifying the brake setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **General Rule:** It's generally advisable to [[bending_techniques_and_considerations_for_metal_enclosures | design enclosures]] from a combination of U-shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. However, very deep components cannot be bent on a brake due to interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Minimizing Machining
[[designing_enclosures_using_waterjet_cutting | Waterjet cutting]] can significantly minimize the need for post-fabrication machining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Pre-painting:** For parts requiring accuracy beyond what the waterjet alone can provide, the part can be [[preparation_and_painting_of_metal_enclosures | waterjet cut]], painted, and then clamped for touch-up machining on surfaces after painting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This method is faster than masking precision surfaces before painting and then cleaning residual paint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The paint finish is durable enough to withstand clamping in a vise for subsequent machining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Example:** In some cases, 95% of the work can be completed by [[waterjet cutting | waterjet cutting]], with only 5% requiring subsequent machining, such as finishing a rim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Complex Assemblies from Simple Enclosure Elements

Even complex assemblies, such as a gearbox with dual-axis rotation, can be constructed using principles similar to simple enclosures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Modular Construction:** Bearing mounts, for example, can be designed as small inserts that are permanently attached (e.g., with screws) to the housing for additional support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Integrated Components:** Gearing can be implemented with internal timing belts, and slip rings can also be integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Consistency:** Complex parts can be broken down into simpler assemblies, typically made from spot-welded bent metal, maintaining the use of captive hardware and keyholes for easy access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Thicker sections can be added or welded on and then machined after the main assembly is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## Advanced Enclosure Examples

An example of a chuck mechanism, which appears to be a fully machined item, is surprisingly constructed almost entirely from [[waterjet cutting | waterjet cut]] parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Components:** It's composed of a pipe and a ring pressed together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Internal Mechanism:** The internal scroll that activates the gripping arms is a [[waterjet cutting | waterjet cut]] helix into which a flexible steel strip is inserted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This method simplifies manufacturing, as the spring material is already hard and smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Traditionally, such a piece would require being made from steel, hardened, and then ground on a CNC grinder for accuracy and wear resistance, which is a significantly more complex and costly process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

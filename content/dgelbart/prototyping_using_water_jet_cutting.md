The emphasis of this course is on building things very quickly using equipment that is easy to master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. While applicable to some limited production, the biggest benefit of the techniques discussed is for [[Prototyping techniques for creating castinglike structures | prototyping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The enabling technology that simplifies the process is [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet cutting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

The course covers:
*   Basic setup, including necessary tools and machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   [[modifications_to_improve_waterjet_productivity | Modifications]] to machines to enhance productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Step-by-step fabrication of various parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Applications of Water Jet Cutting in Prototyping

[[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | Water jet cutting]] offers a wide range of applications for rapid fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Enclosures
[[designing_enclosures_using_waterjet_cutting | Enclosures]] are a common application for [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet cutting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Design for R&D**: [[designing_enclosures_using_waterjet_cutting | Enclosures]] for research and development often feature captive hardware, such as covers that snap into place without screws, and cut-in knockouts to avoid later drilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Keyholes**: Using keyholes instead of regular holes is a significant time-saver, preventing the need to remove screws and avoiding common problems like screws falling into machine parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This feature comes at no additional cost with [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet cutting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Embossing**: [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | Water jetting]] can be used to create lightweight and strong embossed parts. Ribs can be added using a die made quickly on the [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]], often consisting of two [[applications_of_spot_welding_in_prototyping and manufacturing | spot welded]] pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **U-Shaped Piece Construction**: It is often preferred to [[designing_enclosures_using_waterjet_cutting | design enclosures]] from U-shaped pieces rather than bending a single piece on four sides. This allows bending on a brake without needing to move segments, which saves a couple of minutes per bend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Flexures and Springs
[[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | Water jet cutters]] are well-suited for creating flexures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Monolithic Flexures**: These can be very tiny, such as a four-axis positioner for fiber optics, offering X and Y flexure movement with tilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Sheet Metal Flexures**: Flexures can also be made from spring material where the middle part moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **[[creating_custom_springs_and_minimizing_machining_using_water_jet | Spot Welded Springs]]**: Springs can be [[applications_of_spot_welding_in_prototyping and manufacturing | spot welded]] in place, sometimes using Nitinol instead of steel for a larger elastic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Cross Spring Hinges**: These act like normal hinges but are entirely [[applications_of_spot_welding_in_prototyping and manufacturing | spot welded]] with Nitinol flexures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Advantages of Flexures**: They offer advantages over slides by having no wear, no lubrication, and no backlash. They can also be fabricated in minutes, saving significant cost compared to purchasing slides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Carved Springs**: [[creating_custom_springs_and_minimizing_machining_using_water_jet | Springs]] can be carved from solid steel, either cut from hardened material or cut in the annealed state and then hardened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This is useful for springs requiring hundreds of kilos to compress, which would be difficult to wind from thick wire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Disc Springs**: [[creating_custom_springs_and_minimizing_machining_using_water_jet | Disc springs]] with a spiral can be created, which compress completely flat to the material's thickness, ensuring minimum clearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Programmable K Function**: These [[creating_custom_springs_and_minimizing_machining_using_water_jet | disc springs]] do not have to be constant K (spring rate) springs. A constant-width spiral results in a progressive K, with the outer spiral deflecting more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. By linearly tapering the spiral, a constant K can be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This allows for creating springs with an arbitrary K function, which is useful for applications requiring a wide dynamic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Large Structures
[[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | Water jet cutting]] is suitable for creating very large structures, including complex assemblies made from various elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Minimizing Machining
[[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | Water jet cutting]] helps to [[creating_custom_springs_and_minimizing_machining_using_water_jet | minimize machining]] operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   For parts requiring accuracy beyond the water jet's capabilities, the entire part can be water jet cut, painted, and then clamped for touch-up machining on the painted surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This is faster than masking precision surfaces before painting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   Often, 95% of the work can be done on the [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]], with only a small portion like a rim machined afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Complex Assemblies
Complex assemblies can be broken down into simple structures easily fabricated with [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet cutting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Gearboxes**: A gearbox that rotates in two directions on two axes can be built like simple [[designing_enclosures_using_waterjet_cutting | enclosures]], with bearing mounts as small inserts attached with screws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Gearing can be done with timing belts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Captive hardware and keyholes are often used to simplify opening and access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Such complex parts can be made from [[applications_of_spot_welding_in_prototyping and manufacturing | spot welded]] bent metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Thicker sections can be added or welded on and machined after the main fabrication is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Chucks**: An example of a chuck that grips at different diameters appears to be fully machined but is entirely made from [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]] cut parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. It consists of a pipe and a ring pressed together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. The internal scroll that activates the arms is a [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]] cut helix with a flexible steel strip inserted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This method is advantageous because the spring is already hard and smooth, avoiding the extensive work of machining, hardening, and grinding a solid steel piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

When setting up a shop or lab for [[introduction_to_building_prototypes | building prototypes]], a minimal but effective supply of materials is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This article outlines essential materials, focusing on their properties and applications, as well as considerations for stocking them.

## Metals

### Mild Steel
Cold-rolled mild steel sheets are a fundamental material for [[designing_with_wire_sheet_metal_and_solid_materials | designing with sheet metal]] due to their strength, low cost, and ready availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It works well with spot welding, bending, and a [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | waterjet cutter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Recommended Gauges:** For a minimalistic approach, stock Gauge 18 (approx. 1.2 mm) and Gauge 10 (approx. 3 mm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
    *   Gauge 10 is suitable for heavy-duty applications like brackets, bases, and massive assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   Gauge 18 can be used for most other applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Stainless Steel
For stainless steel, a Series 300 type is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **General Purpose:** Stock the cheapest Series 300 stainless in Gauge 18 and Gauge 12 (Gauge 10 is very expensive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Spring Temper Stainless:**
    *   **Type 301 Full Hard:** This allows for making springs by simply cutting a sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It can still be sheared and bent, even though it's springy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Avoid 400 series spring temper stainless as it cannot be sheared or bent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   **Type 17-7 Stainless Steel:** This alloy comes in an annealed (very soft) state but becomes very hard and springy after a specific heat-treating cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The heat cycle involves heating to 760°C, cooling, then heating again to 580°C, with no quenching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This allows for forming and welding in the malleable state before hardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
    *   **Source:** Sitecuts.com is a good source for spring temper stainless, selling ends of rolls cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Free-Machining Metals
For bars and rods of both steel and stainless, always opt for the free-machining type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. While slightly more expensive, the added lead or sulfur significantly reduces machining time and improves surface finish, outweighing the material cost for single parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Aluminum
Aluminum is ideal for large structures and heat sinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Recommended Alloy:** Stock Gauge 10 or 12 in 5052 alloy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   **5052:** Can be bent without cracking, which is crucial for heat sinks that need increased surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   **6061:** A more popular alloy, but it tends to crack when bent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Spring Wire
Keeping a few sizes of spring wire allows for quickly making custom springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Music Wire:** Carbon steel, cheapest option if rust proofing isn't needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **17-7 Stainless Steel:** For corrosion resistance, use this alloy in wire form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. It requires a single heating cycle for hardening (e.g., 480°C for 1 hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Process for Making Springs:** Wire can be gripped in a chuck with a mandrel and wound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Ends can be finished for tension springs by bending a loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a> or a 90° bend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Tension springs can be converted to compression springs by overstretching and cutting the ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Bearing Bronze
Essential for parts that slide on steel, as bronze offers superior performance over brass for this application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Small amounts are useful for bushings or wear pads, providing long-lasting, lubricated contact against hardened steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

### Hardenable Steels
For specialized applications requiring hardened parts, specific steels are recommended.
*   **A2 Steel (Air Hardening):** This is the primary hardenable steel to stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.
    *   **Advantages:** Does not require quenching (simply air cools to harden), which prevents distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. It also has very low dimensional change after hardening, allowing for near-net-shape machining before hardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
    *   **Process:** Heat to white hot (approx. 950°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. To prevent decarburization during heating, wrap the steel in paper, then in stainless foil, and seal the bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.
    *   **Tempering:** After hardening, the steel is brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. Tempering (heating to 250-300°C) provides a trade-off between hardness and toughness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. Temperatures are judged by color change:
        *   Straw color (approx. 220°C): Rockwell C60 (full hardness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
        *   Dark blue (approx. 270°C): Rockwell C55-56 (better toughness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.
*   **440 Stainless Steel (Hardenable Stainless):** Used for surgical tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. It hardens similarly to A2 (heat and cool fast) but is less corrosion resistant than 300 series stainless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   **High-Speed Steel:** Used for cutting tools like drills and reamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. It is extremely hard and cannot be annealed, so it must be ground to shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. Carbide tips can be brazed onto mild steel stems for custom cutting tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.
*   **Regular Carbon Steel:** The cheapest hardenable steel, but it requires quenching and more knowledge for proper heat treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.

### Identifying Steels with Spark Test
When steels are mixed up, a spark test with a grinder can differentiate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>:
*   **Mild Steel:** Few sparks, no "star" bursts at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.
*   **Carbon Steel:** Many sparks with star bursts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
*   **A2 Steel:** Darker, dimmer sparks, no star bursts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
*   **High-Speed Steel & 440 Stainless:** Very few, very dark (reddish) sparks, almost no star bursts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

## Non-Metals (Plastics)

When [[challenges_with_plastic_materials_in_prototyping | working with plastic materials]], consider their tendency to deform under heat (creep) and difficulties in holding threads.

### Polycarbonate (Lexan)
A very versatile and good all-around material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Properties:** Completely shatterproof, can withstand hammering or bullets, bends well, and takes fairly high temperatures (at least 100°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Acetal (Delrin)
Known by its trade name Delrin, this plastic machines exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Properties:** Fairly inexpensive, available in all shapes (plates, rods), and good for general use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Phenolic Laminate (G-10/Phenolic)
An original plastic made from phenolic resin and cotton fabric layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Properties:** Does not easily deform with heat (no creep), does not break, machines beautifully, and holds threads very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. It can absorb oil, making it self-lubricating for moving parts like gears and bearings, offering long life and quieter operation than metal gears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

### Teflon
Known for its lubricity and high-temperature resistance (up to almost 200°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Properties:** Weak material that cold flows, does not hold threads well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Has excellent electrical properties, making it widely used in RF work for coils or high-frequency applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Useful for lightly loaded bushings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### PVC and ABS
Very cheap and readily available plastics, especially in pipe form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Properties:** Can be easily glued together with solvent-based glues (like those used by plumbers) for strong joints in large structures or boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. They are low-temperature materials, becoming weak above 70-80°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Do not hold threads well; require inserts like helicoils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### Polyimide (Vespel)
A very expensive but exotic and high-performance polymer, known by the trade name Vespel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   **Properties:** Available as tape (useful for electrical insulation) and bulk materials (rods, plates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. Can withstand temperatures up to 300°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Has excellent cut-through resistance, making it ideal for electrical insulation against sharp corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Very rigid, doesn't distort, holds shapes and threads well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Can be filled with carbon or moly (MoS2) for improved bearing properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## Other Useful Materials

*   **Loctite:** Useful for tight fits, such as mounting bearings on shafts or securing screws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
    *   **Caution:** Can cause cracking in some plastics if exposed to vapors or in close proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
*   **Wax Stick:** A simple and cheap cutting lubricant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
    *   **Use:** Prevents aluminum from sticking during machining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. It allows aluminum plates to be cut with woodworking tools (e.g., table saw, router) by applying wax to the blade or workpiece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

## Use of Flexures in Mechanical Designs

Flexures are a versatile component in mechanical design, particularly beneficial for prototyping and specific production scenarios due to their ease of fabrication and unique mechanical properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

### Fabrication with Water Jet Cutting

A key enabling technology for creating flexures is water jet cutting, which simplifies their manufacture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. Water jet cutting allows for the creation of:
*   **Monolithic flexures** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
*   Very tiny flexures, even those functioning as multi-axis positioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. For example, a small flexure designed for fiber optics can act as a four-axis positioner with X and Y flexure movement, as well as tilt capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.
*   Flexures from [[Designing with Wire and Sheet Metal | spring material]] or [[Designing with Wire and Sheet Metal | sheet metal]], often spot-welded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
*   Springs carved from solid steel, which can be cut from hard or annealed material and then hardened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. These can be designed to withstand hundreds of kilograms of compression force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   Disc springs with a spiral design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. These springs offer two main advantages:
    *   They can compress completely flat to the thickness of the material, requiring minimal clearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.
    *   Their [[Strength vs Stiffness in Mechanical Engineering | stiffness]] ("K") can be non-constant or even continuously programmable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. A spiral with constant width will result in a progressive K (non-constant [[Strength vs Stiffness in Mechanical Engineering | stiffness]]) because the outer spiral deflects more easily than the inner one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. To achieve a constant K, the spiral can be linearly tapered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. This allows for designing springs with an arbitrary force versus distance plot, enabling a wide dynamic range, such as being affected by low pressure but holding high pressure before bottoming out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

### Advantages of Flexures

Compared to traditional slides or hinges, flexures offer significant benefits:
*   **No wear** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   **No lubrication required** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>, contributing to [[Creating airtight and frictionless parts | frictionless]] and clean designs.
*   **No backlash** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
*   **Rapid fabrication and cost-effectiveness**: They can be made in minutes, as opposed to purchasing expensive slides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

### Applications and Materials

Flexures can be made from various materials to achieve desired properties:
*   **Nitinol**: Used for springs and flexures to achieve a very large elastic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   **Cross-spring hinges**: These function like normal hinges but are entirely made from spot-welded Nitinol flexures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   **Steel**: Solid steel can be used for springs designed to handle hundreds of kilograms of compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

From: [[dgelbart]] <br/> 

The tape peel-off test is a standard method used to assess paint [[adhesion_failure_modes_and_design_considerations | adhesion]] to a surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. It helps determine if the paint has formed a robust [[adhesion_failure_modes_and_design_considerations | bond]] with the substrate or if it's merely resting on the surface without proper chemical or mechanical linkage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Methodology

To perform the test, a very strong adhesive tape, such as the strongest available duct tape, is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

The steps are as follows:
1.  **Prepare the Sample:** Take the [[preparation_and_painting_of_metal_enclosures | painted]] sample <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
2.  **Score the Surface:** Using a knife, create a criss-cross pattern on the [[painted]] surface, typically forming 4x4 squares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
3.  **Apply Tape:** Firmly apply the strong tape over the scored area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
4.  **Peel Off:** Quickly peel the tape off the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Interpretation of Results

*   **Pass:** If no piece of paint is lifted by the tape, the paint passes the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Fail:** If any piece of paint is lifted, the test is considered a failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Enhanced Testing

For a more rigorous evaluation of paint [[adhesion_failure_modes_and_design_considerations | bond]] quality, an enhanced version of the test can be performed:
1.  **Bend the Sample:** Before repeating the tape peel-off test, bend the [[painted]] sample once or twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This flexes the material and puts stress on the paint [[adhesion_failure_modes_and_design_considerations | bond]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
2.  **Repeat Tape Test:** Apply and peel the tape again as described above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

If the paint lifts after bending, it indicates that the [[adhesion_failure_modes_and_design_considerations | bond]] is not "real" or tenacious, even if it passed the initial test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. A truly good [[preparation_and_painting_of_metal_enclosures | paint]] job should be able to pass the peel-off test even after being bent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Significance

This test highlights the importance of proper [[preparing_surfaces_for_painting_and_bonding | surface preparation]] for effective [[adhesion_failure_modes_and_design_considerations | adhesion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Simple cleaning with solvents is often insufficient, as it leaves a molecular monolayer of hydrocarbons that prevents a chemical [[adhesion_failure_modes_and_design_considerations | bond]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, leading to poor [[adhesion_failure_modes_and_design_considerations | adhesion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Methods like [[sand_blasting_for_adhesion_and_painting | sand blasting]] or heating the surface achieve the necessary "wetting" for a strong [[adhesion_failure_modes_and_design_considerations | bond]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

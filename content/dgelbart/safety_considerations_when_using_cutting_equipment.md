When operating cutting equipment, especially [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | waterjet]] and [[cnc_plasma_cutter_as_an_alternative | plasma cutters]], it is crucial to observe specific [[workshop_safety_rules | safety precautions]] to prevent injury and ensure efficient operation.

## Plasma Cutter Safety

Plasma cutters, while versatile, require attention to safety due to the nature of their operation:

*   **Flammable Materials** Avoid having flammable items, such as a butane bottle, in the vicinity where sparks will be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Eye Protection**
    *   Always wear goggles to protect against sparks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
    *   The plasma arc emits intense UV radiation, so goggles are also necessary for UV protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
    *   Ensure that the glasses used are UV-filtered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Electrical Insulation** When using a [[template_cutting_with_plasma_cutter | template]], it is advisable to insulate the tip of the plasma torch to prevent electrical contact with the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Maintaining a small distance from the material being cut is also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. A machined ceramic cap is ideal for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, though wrapping the tip with tape can suffice for a single cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

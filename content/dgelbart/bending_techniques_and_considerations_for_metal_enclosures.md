The process of creating a metal enclosure involves careful [[design_and_fabrication_of_enclosures | design and fabrication]], with particular attention paid to [[bending_techniques_using_press_brakes | bending techniques]] and considerations to ensure an accurate and functional final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Assuming the design is complete and downloaded (e.g., in a DXF file) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, the material is clamped down, and its thickness and height are set for processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Preparation Before Bending
Before beginning the bending process, it is essential to prepare the cut metal part:
*   **Break Sharp Edges** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>: This protects fingers and ensures that components lay flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Cut patterns can leave rough edges that need cleaning up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Repair Defects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>: If an extra cut or misplaced hole occurs, it can be repaired with a spot welder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This saves the part from being scrapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The technique involves placing a slightly oversized piece of metal over the defect and melting it into the hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. For slots, a strip slightly wider than the slot is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. A high setting on the spot welder (e.g., number eight) is used for larger areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. After melting, excess material is cut off and the corner touched up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. For perfection, the area can be sanded down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The plug for a hole doesn't need to be round; a square plug slightly bigger than the hole will work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Bending
Two crucial factors must be considered when [[bending_techniques_using_press_brakes | bending metal]]:

### 1. Order of Bends
The sequence of bends is critical, as some parts can only be bent in a specific order without jamming the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For example, if edges are bent up first, the die for subsequent inner bends must fit between these already bent edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Bending in the wrong order can make it impossible to complete the part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. It's important to analyze the part and determine the correct bending sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. For the example enclosure, the periphery bends are made first, followed by the two long internal bends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### 2. Part Orientation (Mirror Image)
Unless the part is symmetrical, it's vital to orient it correctly before bending to avoid creating a mirror image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This is one of the most common mistakes, leading to a lot of straightening work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Tooling Selection
The choice of tooling depends on the dimensions of the bends being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. If one set of bends is made first, the subsequent tooling must fit between the bent sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Often, segmented tools are necessary for longer bends to accommodate the part's geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Small gaps in the tooling generally do not affect the bend quality significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Ensuring Proper Fit and Squareness
Achieving a precise fit, especially for covers, requires an iterative process:
*   **Test Strips** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>: Always cut a test strip of the same width and material as the cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Programs like SolidWorks Sheet Metal can calculate bend points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Perform a test bend and adjust measurements based on the fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. This prevents wasting the main part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **Material Thickness and Bend Radius** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>: These factors significantly impact fit. Test strips help account for these complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Adjusting Angles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>: If a bend is not perfectly 90 degrees (e.g., slightly open), it can be pushed down to correct the angle and ensure a good fit without gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Always use a protective pad when pressing down on sheet metal to avoid marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Squareness with Braces** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>: If the main enclosure is not perfectly square, it can be adjusted and spot welded with braces to ensure right angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Braces can be welded on one side first, then the part is squared against an external square, and the other side of the braces are welded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## Designing with Waterjet Cutting in Mind
When [[designing_enclosures_using_waterjet_cutting | designing enclosures using waterjet cutting]], specific features can enhance functionality:
*   **Keyed Holes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>: For toggle switches or power inlets, cut a small key or "double D" shape into the hole to prevent rotation of components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. Most off-the-shelf components have such features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
*   **Knockouts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>: These are partially cut holes (leaving small tabs) that can be easily punched out later if needed, especially useful when the box is assembled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   **Integrated Brackets and Clamps** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>: Design and cut any small internal brackets, cable clamps, or other pieces from the same sheet simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. This ensures they are painted together and fit perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

## Limitations and Best Practices for Bending
*   **Hole Registration Across Bends** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>: Holes cut on a single flat plane are perfectly registered by the waterjet (accurate to 0.1mm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. However, once a part is bent, the registration between holes on different planes is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. This is due to variations in bend squareness and material stretching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. If possible, design to avoid holes across bend lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.
*   **Hole Proximity to Bend Lines** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>: Holes or openings placed too close to a bend line will distort and become ugly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. For round holes, this distortion is particularly noticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. If a hole *must* be near a bend line, make it U-shaped or ensure the flat lines are on the bend line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. Ideally, keep any openings at least 10-15 millimeters away from a bend line to avoid distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

## Final Steps Before [[preparation_and_painting_of_metal_enclosures | Painting]]
*   **Install Captive Hardware** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>: Before [[preparation_and_painting_of_metal_enclosures | sandblasting and painting]], install all necessary studs and nuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. Spot welding nuts and studs takes longer than regular welds due to larger contact areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. It's crucial to ensure all captive hardware is installed, as painting acts as an insulator, preventing spot welding afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. Using waterjet-drilled holes for standard round head studs helps align them by feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. Captive hardware is vital in electronics assembly to prevent screws from falling and shorting circuit boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.
*   **Prepare for [[preparation_and_painting_of_metal_enclosures | Painting]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>: Mask off areas where paint is not desired using silicone rubber or Kapton tape, which can withstand high temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

## Assembly
*   **Slide-on Cover Design** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>: Design covers with keyholes and slots so they can slide off without removing screws completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This significantly reduces assembly and maintenance time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

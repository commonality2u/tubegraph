Working with materials that are not metals, such as plastics and ceramics, is often necessary in engineering and R&D work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Ceramics are frequently used when very high temperature resistance or excellent electrical and thermal insulation properties are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Examples include applications in heaters or crucibles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Machinable Ceramics

A good choice for many applications are [[overview_of_machinable_ceramics_for_hightemperature_applications | machinable ceramics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. These materials can withstand very high temperatures yet are quite machinable, often comparable to aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Macor (Glass-Mica Composite)

Macor is a well-known machinable ceramic, specifically a glass-mica composite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Temperature Resistance:** Can withstand up to approximately 1,000째C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Machinability:** It can be filed much like metal, offering machinability comparable to aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. It also retains a very good finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> and is very stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Availability:** Unfortunately, Macor is becoming rarer and more expensive as it is being phased out of the market due to lack of widespread knowledge and orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. It is being replaced by more expensive alternatives like Micro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Machinable Alumina

Machinable alumina is readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. It can be used in its machinable state and then subsequently fired to become very hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Boron Nitride (Hexagonal Form)

Hexagonal boron nitride is often referred to as "white graphite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> due to its excellent lubricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Lubricity:** It is self-lubricating, feeling as if it's oiled, making it ideal for bearings and sliding surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Temperature Resistance:** Capable of withstanding very high temperatures, at least 1,500째C, possibly higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Thermal Expansion:** Has a low temperature expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Machinability:** Very easily machinable and not overly expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Its machining speed is comparable to Macor and aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It is also completely inert and produces a beautiful finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Strength:** The main disadvantage is that it is not strong or hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, but it is an excellent material if strength is not a primary concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Hardened Ceramics

### Hardened Alumina

Hardened alumina parts, such as pipes, plates, and rods, can be purchased readily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Hardness:** It is extremely hard, capable of ruining a file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Strength:** Alumina is one of the strongest ceramics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Machinability:** Cannot be filed or machined by conventional tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. It can only be cut or ground using diamond tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Properties:** Very hard and brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Slate

Slate is a versatile and inexpensive ceramic material often used for roofing and countertops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. It is widely available at stone shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Cost:** A polished 1x1 foot slate panel costs less than 10 dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Machinability:** It is machinable, similar to boron nitride or Macor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, with comparable machining speed to aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. It can be sanded beautifully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a> and cut perfectly with a water jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Unlike polycarbonate, slate can be tapped and threaded without inserts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Disadvantage:** Its primary disadvantage is delamination when heated near 1,000째C, because slate is a layered material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This is not an issue if the design does not require strength in the delamination dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Versatility:** Currently considered the cheapest and best ceramic for many general uses, especially when omnidirectional properties are not strictly required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### Zirconia

Zirconia is a more exotic ceramic material known for its exceptional properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Properties:** It possesses among the highest hardness, strength, and melting points of all ceramics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. It is also an excellent thermal insulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, surpassing alumina in strength, hardness, and insulating properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Cost:** Significantly more expensive than other ceramics, about five to ten times more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. A small blank might cost around $100 compared to a five-dollar piece of slate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Availability (Green Fired State):** Zirconia blocks are used in dentistry for crowns and other parts, making them accessible to R&D labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. These "green fired" (semi-fired) blocks are soft and machinable, similar to soft alumina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Machining speed is comparable to aluminum and other machinable ceramics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Post-Firing:** After firing (sintering), zirconia becomes an extremely hard material that can only be machined with diamond tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Its properties are very similar to tungsten carbide, capable of cutting steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Shrinkage:** A significant consideration when working with green-fired zirconia is the substantial linear shrinkage upon firing, typically 20-30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. The shrinkage factor is predictable and omnidirectional, determined by the density change (e.g., from 3.6 to 6, resulting in about 15-17% shrinkage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Dimensions must be scaled accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. For high-precision parts, a small allowance (0.1-0.2 mm) is left for post-firing diamond machining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Applications:** Ideal for small, intricate parts requiring extreme temperature (up to 2,000째C), enormous pressures, and total inertness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Glass in Precision Components

Glass has a unique property that allows it to maintain its prismatic shape when heated and drawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **Shape Retention:** If a preform with a specific cross-section (e.g., D-shaped) is heated and drawn, it will become thinner but precisely retain its original shape, even sharp corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Accuracy:** The accuracy of form retention is about one micron, and any errors are predictable and repeatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. This allows for sub-micron accuracy after measuring and adjusting the preform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
*   **Applications:** This property is crucial for manufacturing specialized components like miniature cylindrical lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. For example, a one-foot bar ground to an aspheric profile can be drawn into hundreds of feet of nearly diffraction-limited, spherically corrected cylindrical lenses for lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. It is the best process for manufacturing precise prismatic shapes (squares, triangles) or aspheric lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. This must be done carefully at the right temperature in an oven to avoid cracking or deformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

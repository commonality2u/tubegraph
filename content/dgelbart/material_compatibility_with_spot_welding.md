A spot welder is a machine used to weld sheet metal and other forms of metal, including rods and hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The principle of spot welding relies on passing a current (IÂ²R) through the metals, causing them to heat up and weld if they do not conduct electricity well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Compatible Metals

Spot welders are primarily effective with specific types of metals:
*   **Mild Steel** This is one of the materials explicitly mentioned as weldable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   **Stainless Steel** Like mild steel, stainless steel is readily weldable with a spot welder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Charts for setting parameters are often kept separately for stainless steel due to different requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   **Exotic Metals** Materials like tungsten and titanium can be welded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. The general rule for spot welding is that it works well with metals that do not conduct electricity efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Incompatible Materials

Certain materials are not suitable for direct spot welding:
*   **Non-Ferrous Metals** A spot welder "can't weld non-ferrous metals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
    *   **Copper** Copper is explicitly stated as unweldable; attempting to weld it would cause the electrodes themselves to weld together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Phosphor Bronze** and **Beryllium Copper** These materials are not weldable because they are non-ferrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>.
*   **Nitinol** This material is noted as difficult to weld, braze, or solder directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>. It's often used for components like flexure hinges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>.

### Workarounds for Incompatible Materials
For materials that cannot be directly spot welded, a common technique is to "trap" them between two pieces of a weldable material, typically stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>.
*   **Nitinol Flexure Hinges**: To weld a Nitinol flexure hinge, it can be trapped between two layers of stainless steel, allowing the weld to go across the Nitinol and the stainless layers, effectively joining everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>.
*   **Phosphor Bronze or Beryllium Copper Strips**: These can be welded by trapping them between two layers of stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>.
*   **Nitinol Wire**: A Nitinol wire can be joined by sliding a stainless steel hypodermic tubing over it and then welding through the tubing and the Nitinol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>. When using this method, it's advisable to bend the ends of the outer material to create a gradual radius, avoiding abrupt transitions that could weaken the joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>.

## Setting Adjustments for Different Materials

When welding different materials or thicknesses, the spot welder settings must be adjusted carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
*   **Thickness**: The thickness of the metal directly influences the required time setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. For thicker materials, a higher number of cycles (time) is usually needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.
*   **Material Charts**: It's recommended to maintain charts for different materials (e.g., one for stainless steel and one for mild steel) to quickly determine the correct settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. These charts can also include settings for welding specific components like studs or nuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Contact Area**: A larger contact area during welding typically requires a higher setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>, while a smaller contact area, such as when welding rods or balls, allows for lower settings due to high current density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

## Safety Considerations

When using a spot welder, safety precautions are crucial due to sparks and molten metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Eye Protection**: Goggles or glasses are necessary to protect eyes from sparks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Footwear**: Open-toed footwear like sandals should be avoided, as molten metal can drip and cause severe burns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Magnetic Fields**: Be aware of the significant magnetic forces generated by the high current (e.g., 5,000 amps) that can attract metallic or magnetic objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

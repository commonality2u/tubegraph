Even after finish machining, a part may appear visually appealing but lack true accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. When [[creating_airtight_and_frictionless_parts | moving parts]] slide against each other, those built solely from machined components (e.g., on a milling machine or lathe) will quickly wear out and develop play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This is because machined surfaces, even with shallow cuts and slow feeds, only touch at a few high spots when mated with another part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. If these high spots wear off, the part becomes loose, and assemblies lose their accuracy quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

To demonstrate this, one can color a machined surface with a dry-erase marker (or special paints for detecting flatness) and slide it against a very accurate granite plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It will be observed that the part only touches at a few specific corners or spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Achieving High Accuracy Surfaces

To ensure parts maintain accuracy and resist wear, it's crucial to achieve a full bearing surface where contact occurs across the entire area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Grinding as an Intermediate Step
Surface grinding improves machining accuracy because it involves significantly less force between the cutting tool and workpiece, and less clamping force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This reduces distortion caused by clamping in machines like a milling machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. While grinding (on a surface or cylindrical grinder) produces a better surface, it's still not accurate enough to achieve full contact; it will still only touch at a few spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Lapping
Lapping is a method to create a truly flat surface, particularly effective for small parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. It involves moving the part in a randomized motion on an abrasive surface, such as emery cloth or paper attached to a clean granite surface plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. A typical grit for lapping is 220, though finer (400 grit) or coarser (180 grit) can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

The part is typically moved in a figure-eight motion with uniform pressure to remove material, turning it over periodically until the entire surface appears dull and all machining marks are removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

**Lapping Specific Shapes:**
*   **Holes:** A split lap with abrasive paper can be used to lap holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **External Surfaces:** An external split lap can be used for cylindrical objects, often rotated in a lathe while moving the lap back and forth to randomize the abrasive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Limitations:** Lapping requires movement in two directions to randomize the abrasive action and prevent grooves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Shapes like tapers are difficult to lap accurately because two-directional movement is not easily possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Honing is a related process using a grinding stone, similar to lapping but often for internal surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

**Considerations for Lapping Materials:**
*   **Soft Materials:** When lapping soft materials like aluminum or brass, abrasive particles can embed in the material, causing it to act as a permanent lap on mating hard parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. To prevent this, avoid excessive pressure or use softer lapping compounds designed for non-embedding in soft materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Regular lapping compounds are generally suitable for steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### Scraping
Scraping is another method to achieve [[understanding_and_detecting_high_accuracy_parts | high accuracy parts]], particularly suitable for large or heavy structures that cannot be easily moved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. It involves using a reference surface (like a granite plate) to identify high spots and then manually or mechanically removing thin layers of metal from those spots with a scraper tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. The high spots become shiny when rubbed against the reference surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

The process is iterative: scrape in one direction, test, then scrape perpendicular to the previous marks until the high spots are uniformly spread across the surface, indicating full bearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. For large areas, [[manual_and_cnc_operation_of_precision_machines | power scrapers]] are used to speed up the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. High [[high_precision_machinery_and_applications | precision machine tools]] will feature truly scraped surfaces, often with a specific pattern to retain oil, distinguishing them from less precise tools that might have a "fake" scraped appearance over grind marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

## The Importance of Full Bearing and Lubrication
A full bearing surface offers several critical advantages:
1.  **Accuracy:** The part sits accurately and doesn't "walk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
2.  **Stiffness:** A load is distributed over the entire surface, resulting in much higher stiffness and ability to bear heavy loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
3.  **Zero Wear:** If properly lubricated, two perfectly flat surfaces will become hydrodynamic, meaning a film of oil (or air) separates the metal surfaces, preventing metal-to-metal contact and resulting in zero wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This is a key principle in [[the_role_of_lubrication_in_reducing_wear_in_high_accuracy_parts | reducing wear in high accuracy parts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

This principle is demonstrated by hard drive spindles or computer fans that operate hydrodynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. When spinning, they lose electrical contact, indicating no metal-to-metal contact, leading to virtually infinite lifespan without wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Similarly, very flat granite surfaces can float frictionlessly on an air film at low speeds due to air's low viscosity and the load being distributed over a large area, leading to very low pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

## Measuring Precision (Metrology)

Determining if a part is truly precise, beyond just flatness, requires specialized [[reversal_methods_in_precision_instruments_and_metrology | metrology]] techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

### Checking Squareness and Parallelism
*   **Squareness:** To ensure perfect right angles, a known accurate square vise on a grinder can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. Alternatively, a known sub-micron square bar can be clamped to the part, and the assembly processed on a surface grinder, followed by lapping for flatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.
*   **Parallelism:** Once one side is established, the part can be flipped and ground again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. Small deviations in parallelism (e.g., microns) can be corrected during hand lapping by leaning on the higher side, developing a feel for adjusting the pressure point to change the tilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

### Roundness and Runout
For a spindle, it's necessary to separate runout (due to mounting issues) from true roundness (deviation from a perfect circle) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. This can be achieved by using two probes at right angles to measure a perfect ball or cylinder mounted on the spindle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. With two independent signals and two unknowns, both runout and roundness can be resolved separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

### Reversal Methods
A powerful concept in [[reversal_methods_in_precision_instruments_and_metrology | precision instruments and metrology]] is the **reversal method** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. This principle allows for the measurement of properties like straightness, flatness, or roundness *without* needing a perfect reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.

**Principle:**
If you have two surfaces (e.g., a straight edge and a table surface), neither of which is known to be perfectly flat or straight, you can still determine their individual deviations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.
1.  **First Measurement:** Place one surface (e.g., straight edge, f(x)) on the other (e.g., table, g(x)) and use a dial gauge to scan along its length, recording deviations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. The measurement recorded (M1) is a combination of both surfaces' deviations, M1 = f(x) + g(x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
2.  **Second Measurement:** Flip the test part (f(x)) over and measure it again from underneath along the same trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. The new measurement (M2) will be M2 = g(x) - f(x) (due to the inversion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
3.  **Solving Equations:** With two independent equations for each point (M1 and M2) and two unknowns (f(x) and g(x)), you can solve for each function separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. Any tilt error introduced by differences in height between measurements can be mathematically removed, as tilt doesn't affect true straightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

This [[reversal_methods_in_precision_instruments_and_metrology | reversal method]] is fundamental to separating roundness from runout in spindles, measuring straightness, and accurately dividing circles where cumulative errors must close perfectly (e.g., 360 degrees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

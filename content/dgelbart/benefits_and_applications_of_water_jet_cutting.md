Water jet cutting is an enabling technology that simplifies the fabrication process, particularly for [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | prototyping]] and limited production runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. It allows for the rapid creation of parts using equipment that is easy to master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Key Benefits of Water Jet Cutting

*   **Speed and Ease of Use**
    *   Enables very quick construction of items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
    *   Reduces the need for extensive machining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Design Flexibility and Efficiency**
    *   Allows for features like knockouts and key holes, saving time by avoiding drilling and preventing screw loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. These features come at no additional cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   Facilitates the creation of lightweight and strong embossed parts, with embossing dies made quickly using a water jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    *   Supports the design of U-shaped pieces for enclosures, which can be bent on a brake without needing to adjust segments, saving minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Precision and Performance**
    *   Ideal for flexures, offering advantages like no wear, no lubrication, and no backlash compared to traditional slides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. These can be made quickly and affordably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   For highly accurate parts, the water jet can cut the entire part, which is then painted and touched up on a machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This method is faster than masking precision surfaces before painting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Applications of Water Jet Cutting

Water jet cutting can be applied to a wide range of fabrication tasks, including:

*   **Enclosures**
    *   Simple boxes, often designed with captive hardware and snap-in covers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   Electronic enclosures, which can incorporate features like knockouts and key holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Complex electronic housings can be constructed from simple, spot-welded, bent metal elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Flexures**
    *   Monolithic designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
    *   Tiny flexures, such as a four-axis positioner for fiber optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   Flexures made from spring material, including Nitinol for large elastic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   Cross-spring hinges that function like normal hinges but are entirely spot-welded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Large Structures and Complex Assemblies**
    *   Suitable for creating very large structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   Enables the creation of complex assemblies from simpler, water jet-cut elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
    *   For parts requiring higher accuracy, 95% of the work can be done by water jet, with only a small portion (e.g., a rim) machined afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Springs**
    *   Springs carved from solid steel, even hard materials, which can handle hundreds of kilograms of compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   Disc springs with spirals that can compress completely flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   Disc springs can be designed with an arbitrary K function (force versus distance), allowing for a continuously programmable K as a function of distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Specialized Components**
    *   A chuck, which appears to be a completely machined item, can be made almost entirely from water jet-cut parts, including the scroll that activates the arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. The scroll can be a water jet-cut helix with an inserted flexible steel strip, avoiding the need for complex CNC grinding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

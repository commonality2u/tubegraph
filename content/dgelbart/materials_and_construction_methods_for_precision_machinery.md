This article details the materials and construction methods used to create a scratch-built, very high-precision lathe and grinder capable of cutting, turning, and grinding parts to a tolerance of one micron (40 millionths of an inch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Achieving One Micron Accuracy

The machine was built from scratch and operates as a full [[high_precision_cnc_lathe_design_and_functionality | CNC]] machine, utilizing a customized [[high_precision_cnc_lathe_design_and_functionality | CNC]] software package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Achieving one-micron accuracy requires starting with a very good bed and spindles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Machine Bed Construction

The machine bed is constructed from granite parallels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Granite Parallels:** These are bars of granite with all four sides parallel to a micron over their entire length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Bonding:** The bed is built by bonding one granite bar to another using epoxy to form a 'T' shape, and then two 'T' shapes to form the complete bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Assembly Process:** During gluing, the entire assembly is flipped upside down onto a granite table, with very accurate spacers placed inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This ensures that once the epoxy cures, the critical surfaces are co-planar and the gaps are accurate to a micron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Compression Joints:** The glue joints are held under compression by bolts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This is crucial because epoxy, like other adhesives, is very strong in pure shear but weak in other modes. By holding the parts under compression, the epoxy is primarily subjected to shear stress, with other stresses absorbed by the compression from the bolts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Air Bearings

All moving parts of the machine, including the saddle, cross-slide, main spindle, and grinding spindle, float on air bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Spindle Bearings:** The air bearings for the main spindle and grinding spindle are surplus semiconductor machinery units, which are cost-effective due to the prevalence of air-bearing-based machinery in the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Tail Stock:** The tail stock is also mounted on air bearings, allowing for very long travel and a significant center distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Chuck Design

The chuck features an unusual design based on an extinct American Skinner Chuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Watertight Operation:** A unique feature is its ability to remain completely watertight at any jaw opening, achieved through drive pins that cover the slots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Pin Gripping:** Designed for very small loads, the chuck can grip parts using pins inserted into the chuck, allowing for internal diameter (ID) or outside diameter (OD) gripping without changing jaws. These pins provide a very wide gripping range, from zero to about 200 mm diameter, in addition to the regular jaw gripping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Run-out Adjustment:** The chuck also has run-out adjustment screws, enabling the operator to zero the run-out of the chuck to a reference surface, which is useful when re-chucking a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Grinding Capabilities

The machine is equipped for both external and [[techniques_for_precise_hole_drilling_and_reaming | internal grinding]].
*   **Cross-slide Travel:** The cross-slide has sufficient travel to allow room for either lathe tooling or the grinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Internal Grinding:** The grinding wheel can be removed to attach internal grinding mounts, such as collet adapters for internal wheels or direct-mount threaded wheels for more rigid internal grinding applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Custom Grinding Wheels:** [[creating_custom_springs_and_minimizing_machining_using_water_jet | Custom internal grinding wheels]] can be easily made from used grinding stones by cutting them to any desired size with a water jet cutter and then mounting them with epoxy on a shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This provides access to the full range of wheel materials available for external grinding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Additional Features

*   **Manual Operation:** The lathe can be used in [[manual_and_cnc_operation_of_precision_machines | manual]] mode with digital readouts if there are any issues with the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Built-in Microscope:** A convenient built-in microscope allows for magnified viewing of small workpieces, with the view displayed on a screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Example of Precision Work

The machine can produce parts with extreme precision, such as a cylinder and piston assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   The piston exhibits a complete sliding fit within the cylinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   When the air vent is sealed, the assembly is completely [[creating_airtight_and_frictionless_parts | airtight]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Due to its accuracy, the piston spins freely and [[creating_airtight_and_frictionless_parts | frictionlessly]] like a self-acting air bearing, akin to air bearings found in hard drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This means a bearing made with this precision would never need lubrication and would not wear out because there is no contact between the inner and outer parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   These parts come out with the required tolerance directly from the machine, avoiding time-consuming lapping processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Spot welding often requires custom electrodes to achieve specific weld characteristics, access difficult areas, or accommodate unique part geometries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Materials for Electrodes

Spot welding electrodes are generally made from copper, a material that is easy to bend and work-hardens after bending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. If copper becomes too hard to bend, it can be annealed (softened) and will re-harden through the bending process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

The tips of the electrodes, which experience significant wear and squeezing, are typically made from harder alloys rather than pure copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. Common materials for tips include copper-tungsten alloy or, more affordably, copper-chrome alloy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. A rod of copper-chrome alloy can yield over 100 tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

## Making Electrode Tips

To insert a tip into a copper electrode, a tapered hole is machined into the copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. This taper can be created using a "dbit," which is a dowel pin ground to a taper and then ground flat to half its diameter, functioning as a milling cutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. This dbit is hard enough to cut copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. The tapered insert is then pressed into the hole, and the copper will flow and conform, ensuring a good fit even if the initial machining is not perfectly accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

## Types and Applications of Custom Electrodes

Custom electrodes are essential for a variety of tasks and to achieve specific weld outcomes:

### Hollow Electrodes for Captive Hardware
Hollow electrodes are used to weld captive hardware such as studs, nuts, hinges, and standoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. They are designed with a hollow shape to accept the standard sizes of screws or other hardware components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Some standoffs feature a small ball and spring inside the electrode to securely hold the hardware in place, preventing it from falling out when working vertically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

For precise placement, a small pilot mark (e.g., from a water jet cutter or a 1mm drill hole) on the workpiece allows the stud's small pip to "lock in," ensuring accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Standard round-head screws can also be welded in place of specialized weld studs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

### Electrodes for Spot Welding Nuts
Spot welding nuts, which have three projections and a pilot shoulder, are available in various sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. These are typically welded using two flat electrodes after a hole is cut for the pilot to fit into, ensuring accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Due to the large contact area, a higher current setting is usually required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Welding can sometimes eject metal into the threads, requiring a tap to clean them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. As an alternative, a plain washer can be welded to the back of thin sheet metal (where a thread typically wouldn't hold) to create a thicker section for tapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

### Conical Electrodes for Welding Balls
For applications requiring kinematic mounts, couplings, or adjustable mechanisms, balls can be spot welded to rods or flat surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. A custom electrode with a conical hole is used to hold the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Another electrode type welds balls to flat surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[01:16:32]</a>. Despite the conical adapter touching the ball in a ring, the large contact area prevents marking on the ball's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

### Dimpled Electrodes for Invisible Welds
To achieve invisible welds, particularly for aesthetic or cleanliness requirements (e.g., medical devices), a special electrode with a very small dimple at the weld point is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:30">[01:18:30]</a>. This dimple, typically a few millimeters in diameter and about 50 microns deep, pushes metal outwards to compensate for the shrinkage that occurs when molten metal solidifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>. This results in a nearly perfectly flat surface, requiring minimal sanding to remove any slight bump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. Standard flat electrodes cause the metal to pull inwards, leaving a difficult-to-remove mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>.

### Electrodes for [[material_compatibility_with_spot_welding|Welding Difficult Materials]]
When welding materials that are difficult to spot weld, such as Nitinol or phosphor bronze (which are non-ferrous and do not weld well due to high electrical conductivity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:50">[02:10:50]</a>, they can be "trapped" between two pieces of a weldable material, like stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:13">[02:00:13]</a>. The weld passes through the outer stainless steel layers, bonding everything together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:26">[02:00:26]</a>. This typically requires pointed electrodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:51">[02:00:51]</a> and a slightly higher setting than for stainless steel alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:13">[02:00:13]</a>. It's advisable to bend the ends of the trapped material to create a gradual radius, avoiding abrupt transitions that could create weak points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:31">[02:01:31]</a>.

### Specialty Electrodes for Deep or Offset Access
For welding in confined spaces or around obstacles, custom electrodes can be shaped with bends or offsets to reach deep inside boxes or cavities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:21">[02:25:21]</a>. Thin electrodes are also made to access small areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:14">[02:26:14]</a>.

### Angled Electrodes
For repetitive tasks requiring parts to be welded at a precise angle, such as studs all pointing the same way, custom electrodes can be cut from scrap copper at the desired angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:46">[02:26:46]</a>.

### Electrodes for Watertight Enclosures
To create watertight enclosures, a thin bead of silicone RTV can be spread between the metal sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:35">[02:28:35]</a>. Spot welding through the silicone with a dense pitch will displace the RTV, forming a completely watertight seal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:21">[02:29:21]</a>.

### Electrodes for Salvaging Material
To maximize the use of material for water jet cutting (which has a clamping area that prevents cutting to the very edge), small pieces can be attached to larger scraps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:37">[02:29:37]</a>. For thin materials, one piece can be placed atop another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:02">[02:30:02]</a>. For thicker materials where a step is undesirable, two pieces can be butt-welded flush at the joint using electrodes, melting them horizontally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:08">[02:30:08]</a>. This creates a smooth surface for clamping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:44">[02:30:44]</a>.

## General Electrode Design Principles

*   **Minimizing Marking:** To prevent marking on one side of a workpiece, the electrode on that side should have a much larger contact area than the welding tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:28">[02:27:28]</a>. For instance, if the weld tip has a 3mm square contact, the opposite electrode might have a 30mm square contact, ensuring that side doesn't heat up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:33">[02:27:33]</a>.
*   **Neck Length:** A shorter electrode neck reduces inductance, which can be beneficial for maximizing current, especially when welding magnetic materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:45">[02:25:45]</a>. While some commercial welders have longer necks, custom electrodes can be designed with short necks for efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:57">[02:25:57]</a>.

A spot welder is a machine used for [[welding techniques for rods and various hardware | welding]] sheet metal and other materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This article covers its basic operation, safety measures, various applications, and how to create custom electrodes.

## Operation and Settings

Spot welders typically have settings for time, and some may also include a pressure setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The pressure setting should generally be set to maximum and left there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The time setting, however, must be carefully adjusted based on the metal's thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Determining the Correct Setting

To find the right time setting, perform a "tear test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>:
1.  Take two pieces of the metal you intend to weld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
2.  Make a few welds at different time settings, starting with a lower setting like two cycles for 0.7mm (gauge 22) sheet metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
3.  Perform a tear test: the metal should tear without the weld opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. If the weld itself opens, the setting is too weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
4.  Once the correct setting is found, it can be charted for future reference, with separate charts for stainless steel and mild steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Material Compatibility

Spot welders primarily weld mild steel and stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. They generally cannot weld non-ferrous metals like copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, as the welding process relies on the material's resistance to electricity to generate heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Exotics like tungsten, titanium, or niobium can also be welded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Current vs. Time Adjustment

When a spot welder has adjustable current and time, always set the current to its highest level and adjust only the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. High current and short times result in more efficient welds with less heat escaping sideways, similar to a [[the_role_of_laser_welding_in_brazing_preparation | laser weld]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The only exception is if the lowest time setting is still too high for very thin materials; then, the current can be lowered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### KVA Ratings and Thickness Limits

A 15 KVA unit is typically the minimum recommended, with units ranging from 15 to 25 KVA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. A 15 KVA unit can weld up to 3mm to 3mm thick metal (or gauge 12 to gauge 12 steel), requiring around 15 cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Stainless steel allows for slightly heavier gauges, like gauge 10 to gauge 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Spot welding capabilities align with the point where TIG welding becomes easier for thicker materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Safety Precautions

> [!CAUTION] Safety comes first.
> *   Always wear goggles, or regular glasses are sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
> *   Never wear sandals, as molten metal can drip and melt footwear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. In general, no sandals in the [[workshop_safety_rules | shop]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
> *   Be aware of the significant magnetic force created by the 5,000 amps flowing through the electrodes, as it can attract magnetic or metallic objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>. Despite the high current, the voltage is very low (2.5 volts), so direct contact with electrodes is generally safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.

## [[applications_of_spot_welding_in_prototyping_and_manufacturing | Applications of Spot Welding]]

Spot welding offers versatility for both temporary and permanent bonds, making it highly useful for [[applications_of_spot_welding_in_prototyping_and_manufacturing | prototyping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Temporary vs. Permanent Welds
By setting the time to a lower cycle (e.g., one cycle), a very weak, temporary weld can be made that can be easily broken off by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This is useful for positioning components during [[applications_of_spot_welding_in_prototyping_and_manufacturing | prototyping]] before applying a permanent weld at a higher setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. If a permanent weld needs to be opened, it's best to drill it out, as trying to twist or pry it off will tear the metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Welding Rods and Captive Hardware
Spot welding is ideal for [[welding techniques for rods and various hardware | welding rods]], such as a half-inch rod to a half-inch rod, due to the small contact area and efficient heat transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
It is also very useful for welding [[welding techniques for rods and various hardware | captive hardware]] like hinges, nuts, studs, standoffs, and latches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. For studs, many have a small pip that aligns with a pre-marked spot on the sheet metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Spot welding nuts, which have three projections and a pilot shoulder, offer accurate threading in thin sheet metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

### Welding Balls
Balls can be spot welded for kinematic mounts or adjustable couplings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This requires an electrode with a conical hole to hold the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Despite the electrode touching the ball, if there's sufficient contact area, no marks will be left on the ball's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

### Invisible Welds
To achieve invisible welds, especially for aesthetic or cleanliness reasons (e.g., medical devices), a special electrode with a small, shallow dimple at the weld point is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. This dimple pushes metal outwards, compensating for the shrinkage when the molten metal cools, resulting in a perfectly flat surface that requires minimal sanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

### Welding Non-Weldable Materials
Materials difficult to weld, like Nitinol, phosphor bronze, or beryllium copper, can be joined by trapping them between two pieces of stainless steel, allowing the weld to go through the stainless and fuse everything together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. It's recommended to bend the ends of the non-weldable material to avoid abrupt transitions that could weaken the joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

### Watertight Enclosures
Watertight enclosures can be created by spreading a very thin bead of RTV silicone between the parts and then welding through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. The welding pressure displaces the silicone, creating a watertight seal around the weld points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.

### Salvaging Material for Water Jet Cutting
Spot welding can be used to attach scrap pieces to thin material, allowing them to be held in a water jet cutter's clamping area, thus maximizing material usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. For thicker materials where a step is undesirable, parts can be butt-welded flush at the joint horizontally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

## [[creating_custom_electrodes_for_specific_welding_needs | Creating Custom Electrodes]]

Many spot welding jobs require [[creating_custom_electrodes_for_specific_welding_needs | custom electrodes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

### Materials and Fabrication
Electrodes are typically made from copper bars, which are easy to bend and work-harden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. For long-lasting tips, inserts made from copper-tungsten alloy or copper-chrome alloy are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. These inserts can be machined with a taper and pressed into a corresponding tapered hole in the copper electrode body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. A simple method for making tapered holes involves grinding a dowel pin into a tapered d-bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.

### Types of Custom Electrodes
[[creating_custom_electrodes_for_specific_welding_needs | Custom electrodes]] can be fabricated for various purposes:
*   **Deep access:** Long, thin electrodes to reach into boxes or cavities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.
*   **Offset:** To navigate around folds in metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.
*   **Angled:** For welding rods or studs at precise angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
*   **Holding small parts:** Designed to hold tiny components in place during welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

### Avoiding Marks on Parts
To prevent marks on a part being welded, ensure the contact area of the electrode touching that part is significantly larger than the contact area of the opposing electrode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. This ensures that the larger electrode does not heat up or mark the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

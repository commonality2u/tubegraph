This article outlines essential [[safety_precautions_with_lathes_and_drill_presses | safety precautions]] to observe in a workshop, focusing on [[unexpected_hazards_of_woodworking_machines | unexpected hazards]] beyond basic rules.

## General Workshop Rules
Always follow the specific rules of the workshop you are working in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This may include wearing goggles at all times or steel-toed shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## [[unexpected_hazards_of_woodworking_machines | Woodworking Machines]]
Surprisingly, woodworking machines are considered the most dangerous in a machine shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **High Speed and Sharp Tools**: Woodworking machinery operates at very high speeds, typically 10 times the surface speed of metalworking tools, and the tools are extremely sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Cutting Risk**: The chance of losing a finger on a woodworking machine is significantly higher than on metalworking equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Even if a blade appears to be almost stopped, it can still cut off a finger with its last few turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Safe Operation**:
    *   Always stay away from the blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   When cutting wood lengthwise or handling small pieces, use a push stick or tool instead of your hands to push the wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   Never stand behind the blade or attempt to pull a long piece of wood from the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. If anything gets stuck, the blade can pull the wood and your hand into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
    *   Always work from the front side of the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## [[dangers_of_grinder_machines_and_brittle_wheels | Grinder Machines]]
All types of grinders share a common hazard: a very brittle wheel turning at high speeds, often around 3600 RPM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Shattering Risk**: A sharp blow to the wheel when it's turning can cause it to shatter and fragments to fly off like bullets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Standing Position**: Never stand directly in front of the wheel when grinding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Always stand to the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## [[safe_handling_of_hand_tools | Hand Tools]] (Hammering)
The primary safety hazard when using hand tools is hammering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Eye Protection**: Always wear goggles when hammering or chiseling, even if you have prescription safety glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Avoid Hard on Hard**: Never hit hard steel on hard steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This can generate huge stress, causing a piece of metal to fly off with enough energy to penetrate your body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Tool Design**: Tools designed to be hammered, such as chisels, typically have a soft end where the hammer strikes and a hardened end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Maintain Tools**: The soft end can mushroom over time; periodically grind off the mushroomed portion to prevent pieces from breaking off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Using Soft Intermediaries**: If you must hit a hard object with a hard hammer, place a piece of soft material (e.g., soft steel) between them to absorb the impact and prevent chipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Identifying Hardened Material**:
    *   **Filing Test**: Attempt to file the material. If it's soft, the file will bite; if it's hard, the file will slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
    *   **Bounce Test**: Drop the material onto a known hardened surface. Hardened materials will bounce significantly more than soft materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## Lathe Operation [[safety_precautions_with_lathes_and_drill_presses | Safety]]
Lathes are generally safe, but have two primary unexpected dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Entanglement Hazards**:
    *   **Internal Threads**: Never put your finger or any part of your hand inside a rotating thread on a lathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The thread can pull your finger in and shear it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
    *   **External Rotating Parts and Loose Items**: Avoid touching the outside of rotating parts with rags, loose sleeves, earphone wires, or long hair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. These can get wrapped around the rotating part, creating a capstan effect that tenaciously pulls your hand or body into the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Once entangled, it's impossible to let go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Working with Brass**:
    *   **Tool Pull-in**: Brass has a property of pulling the tool into itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
    *   **Specialized Tools**: Use special tools ground for brass, which have a zero rake angle, meaning the cutting edge touches the brass squarely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
    *   **Drills for Brass**: Drills for brass should have a flat ground at the end to ensure the helix angle doesn't create a sharp angle with the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
    *   **Consequences of Incorrect Tools**: If not using the correct tools, the lathe tool can be pulled into the chuck, or a drill can pull the drilling chuck out of the tailstock, causing it to spin or fly out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Drill Press Operation [[safety_precautions_with_lathes_and_drill_presses | Safety]]
The drill press is a relatively safe machine, provided certain precautions are taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **Clamping the Part**: The most crucial [[drill_press_time_saving_techniques | safety precaution]] is properly clamping the part being drilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
    *   **Centering**: Start the hole with a center drill, as the center mark alone may not be sufficient, especially for large drills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
    *   **Large Drills**: For drills larger than 10mm, drill in two steps: first half the diameter, then enlarge to the full diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   **Awkward Shapes**: If a part is too awkward to clamp in a vise, do not hold it in your hands, as it can catch the drill and spin, potentially cutting your hand if it has sharp edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
    *   Instead, use a locking plier, like a vice grip, to hold the part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Drill at a slower speed to allow time to react if something goes wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Drilling Brass**: The dangers of drilling brass on a lathe (tool pull-in, chuck displacement) also apply to a drill press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Protecting Surfaces**:
    *   **Never Use Rags**: Do not place a rag under the material you are drilling to protect the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. As soon as the drill breaks through, the rag will inevitably get wrapped around the drill, causing everything to fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
    *   **Use Paper**: If you need to protect the surface, use a sheet of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Paper will simply be drilled through and will not wrap around the drill because it lacks fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

## Presses [[safety_precautions_when_using_a_press | Safety]]
A press is a deceptive machine that appears safe due to slow movement but generates immense forces and stored energy, posing high dangers if not properly operated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   **Stored Energy**: A compressed piece of hardened steel can store a significant amount of energy, potentially more than a crossbow limb of the same material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.
*   **Shattering Risk**: If a brittle material like hardened steel is compressed beyond its maximum compressive strength, it is guaranteed to shatter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. The energy released causes pieces to fly out like bullets from a handgun, with comparable energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   **Operating Precautions**:
    *   **Material Selection**: Do not press hard, brittle materials against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
    *   **Strength Limits**: If hard materials must be pressed, never approach the material's strength limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
    *   **Bulletproof Guard**: Always use a bulletproof guard, such as a half-inch lexan shield, to stop any flying fragments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
    *   **Bendable Materials**: Before bending, ensure the material is actually bendable (e.g., not hardened steel, 7000 series aluminum, or spring-temper beryllium copper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Materials that break instead of bending can suddenly jump up and fly in your face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

Presses are powerful machines capable of performing various tasks like straightening, flattening, and shaping materials, particularly in conjunction with a [[water_jet_cutting | water jet]] machine for creating custom tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. However, their use requires significant caution due to inherent dangers and specific operational considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Press Safety Precautions

A press is considered one of the most dangerous machines in a shop due to its ability to store immense energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Material Dangers
*   **Brittle or Hardened Materials**: Compressing a brittle material like hardened steel can cause it to shatter, releasing stored energy suddenly and sending pieces flying like shrapnel in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The forces involved are not just vertical but also sideways due to Poisson's ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Such an event can be fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   **Rule**: Never press a hardened or brittle piece of material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Tooling Risk**: Even when working with ductile materials, the tooling itself or parts of the press may be hardened, posing a risk of shattering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Shrapnel Risk
> If there is any doubt about the material or tooling, always use a shield made of half-inch polycarbonate, as it is shatter-proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Pressing anything except sheet metal should be done with a shield in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Press Damage Considerations
*   **Concentrated Force**: Applying the full force of a press to a very small area (like a dime or a small washer) can damage the press itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. For example, 100 tons concentrated on 2 square centimeters can exceed the yield strength of the best steel (e.g., 50 tons per square cm vs. 10-20 tons yield strength) and cause dents or cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Minimum Area**: To prevent damage, a 100-ton press should ideally not be used to press something with an area less than 10 square centimeters to maintain a safety factor of around 10 tons per square centimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Applications of Presses in Fabrication

A press is invaluable for manufacturing specific forms, especially when combined with a [[water_jet_cutting | water jet]] for rapid tooling creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Creating Lightweight, High-Performance Structures
Presses are crucial for creating high-performance, lightweight structures, particularly for applications like airborne components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Stiffness through Closed Forms**: Rigidity in lightweight structures is best achieved through closed-form pieces, similar to how a car chassis gains rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   A flat strip of metal has low rigidity and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   Pressing in a rib increases the moment of inertia and strength significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
    *   A bent piece with an open form (e.g., a "U" shape) is strong in bending but weak torsionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    *   Pressing two ribs and spot-welding them to create a closed shape provides both bending and torsional stiffness with the same weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Tooling and Material Considerations
*   **Rapid Tooling**: A [[water_jet_cutting | water jet]] allows for cutting special tooling shapes from mild steel plates in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This is significantly faster than CNC milling, which requires extensive clamping and setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Materials for Structures**:
    *   Mild steel is suitable for normal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
    *   For truly high-performance structures, certain stainless steels like 17-7 stainless are ideal because they can be hardened through simple heat treatment cycles (without quenching) after forming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This allows for pressing, spot welding, and then heat-treating the entire assembly to achieve high elastic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Specific Pressing Tasks
*   **Cylindrical Boxes**: Presses are used to create cylindrical box covers with a bent-up lip for spot welding, utilizing male and female tooling cut by a [[water_jet_cutting | water jet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Ribs and Reinforcements**: Pressing ribs into thin steel, such as for lightweight box covers, provides effective reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Pressing Techniques and Tooling Alignment

Achieving precise pressed shapes requires specific techniques for tooling and alignment.

### Tooling Clearance
When creating male and female tooling with a [[water_jet_cutting | water jet]], ensure sufficient clearance. For 1 mm thick material, the clearance should be approximately 1.5 to 2 mm around to prevent jamming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### Pressing Methods
1.  **Male Tool Against Rubber/Lead**:
    *   **Process**: Press a male tool against a very hard rubber or polyurethane (best) or a sheet of lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The rubber/lead must be larger than the metal piece being pressed to prevent wrinkling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
    *   **Result**: This method produces a nice rib but with less sharp definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
    *   **Use**: Ideal for getting a rough initial shape, which can then be used for alignment in the next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Lead can be melted and reused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

2.  **Male and Female Dies**:
    *   **Process**: After an initial press (e.g., against rubber), the rough shape on the material can be used to register and align the male and female dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This ensures precise alignment, preventing damage to the tool or job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
    *   **Result**: Provides much sharper lines and allows for deep drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
    *   **Deep Drawing**: For complex or very deep shapes, annealing (heating the material to red hot and letting it cool) may be required between multiple drawing steps to prevent tearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. For example, first draw with a 0.5-inch thick die, anneal, then draw with a 1-inch thick die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### Shearing vs. Pressing
The difference between shearing and pressing is subtle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   If a steel tool has sharp, unrounded corners and is pressed into rubber or lead, it can act like a punch and shear out the part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   Rounded edges on tooling promote pressing, while sharp edges promote shearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This technique can be useful for producing many identical parts by punching them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

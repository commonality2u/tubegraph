Adhering to general workshop safety rules, such as wearing goggles and steel-toed shoes, is paramount in any shop environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Beyond basic guidelines, it is crucial to be aware of unexpected safety hazards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## [[woodworking_machine_hazards | Woodworking Machines]]

Surprisingly, [[woodworking_machine_hazards | woodworking machines]] are often the most dangerous in a machine shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **High Speed and Sharp Tools** [[woodworking_machine_hazards | Woodworking machinery]] operates at very high speeds, typically 10 times faster than metalworking tools, and uses extremely sharp tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This significantly increases the risk of serious injury, such as cutting off a finger, even if the blade appears to be nearly stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Maintain Distance** Always keep hands away from the blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Use Push Tools** For lengthwise cuts or when working with small pieces, always use a push stick or a similar tool to guide the wood, never your bare hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Avoid Standing Behind the Blade** Never stand behind the blade or attempt to pull a long piece of wood from the other side while cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. If the wood gets stuck, the blade can pull it, along with your hand, into the blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Work from the Front** Always work from the front of the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## [[grinder_safety_precautions | Grinders]]

[[grinder_safety_precautions | Grinders]], including tool grinders, use brittle wheels rotating at high speeds (typically 3600 RPM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Avoid Standing in Front** Never stand directly in front of the grinding wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. A sharp blow to the wheel can cause it to shatter and send fragments flying like bullets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Always stand to the side when operating a grinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## [[safe_use_of_hand_tools | Hand Tools]]

The primary safety hazard with [[safe_use_of_hand_tools | hand tools]] arises during hammering and chiseling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Eye Protection** Always wear goggles, even over prescription safety glasses, when hammering or chiseling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Avoid Hard-on-Hard Contact** Never strike hard steel on hard steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Hammer faces are hardened, while tools designed to be hammered on (like chisels) have a softer striking end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Mushrooming** The soft end of tools can mushroom over time and should be ground off to prevent pieces from breaking away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
    *   **Flying Shrapnel** Striking hard steel on hard steel creates immense stress, potentially causing a piece of metal to fly off with enough energy to penetrate the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
    *   **Using Soft Material Intermediary** If you must strike a hard object with a hammer, place a piece of soft material (e.g., copper, lead) between the hammer and the object to prevent chipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Identifying Hardened Materials**
    *   **Filing Test** Try to file the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. A file will slip on hardened steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   **Bounce Test** Drop the material onto a known hardened surface and observe how much it bounces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Hardened materials will bounce more than soft ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Be aware if what you're dealing with is hardened or not, and avoid hammering hardened materials directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## [[lathe_and_drill_press_safety_hazards | Lathes]]

While generally safe, [[lathe_and_drill_press_safety_hazards | lathes]] present two unexpected dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Rotating Parts and Clothing/Body**
    *   **Internal Threads** Never put your finger or any part of your hand inside a rotating thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The thread will pull your finger in and shear it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
    *   **External Rotating Parts and Rags** Avoid touching the outside of rotating parts with a rag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The rag can wrap around the part and pull your hand into the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
    *   **Loose Clothing/Hair** Do not wear loose sleeves, earphone wires, or have long hair hanging around the lathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Anything that touches a rotating part can wrap around, causing a capstan effect that locks it and pulls you into the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Working with Brass**
    *   **Tool Pull-In** Brass has a property of pulling the cutting tool into the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
    *   **Special Tools** Use tools specifically ground for brass, which have a zero rake angle, meaning the cutting edge is square to the brass surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Drills used for brass should also have a flat ground at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
    *   **Chuck Ejection** Failure to use proper tools for brass can cause the lathe tool to be pulled into the chuck, or the drill to pull the entire drilling chuck out of the tailstock, causing it to spin with the workpiece or even fly out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## [[lathe_and_drill_press_safety_hazards | Drill Presses]]

A [[lathe_and_drill_press_safety_hazards | drill press]] is generally safe, but requires care in clamping and specific material handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **Clamping the Part** Always clamp the workpiece securely in a vise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Avoid Hand-Holding** Never hold an awkward or large piece directly by hand, as it can catch the drill and start spinning, cutting your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. If clamping is not possible, use a locking plier like a vise grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Center Drilling** Always start a hole with a center drill, especially for larger drills, as a center mark alone may not be sufficient to guide the drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Two-Step Drilling for Large Holes** For drills larger than 10 mm, it is best to drill in two steps: first half the diameter, then enlarge to the full diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   **Drilling Brass** The same dangers of tool pull-in and chuck ejection that apply to [[lathe_and_drill_press_safety_hazards | lathes]] when drilling brass also apply to [[lathe_and_drill_press_safety_hazards | drill presses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Ensure the part is very secure.
*   **Never Place Rags Under Material** Do not place a rag under the material you are drilling to protect the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. As the drill breaks through, the rag will inevitably wrap around the drill, pulling everything with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Use Paper for Protection** If surface protection is needed, use a sheet of paper, as it will not wrap around the drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

## [[safety_precautions_in_presswork | Presses]]

[[safety_precautions_in_presswork | Presses]] can be deceptive because they move slowly but generate enormous forces and stored energy, posing significant dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   **Stored Energy** Hardened steel under compression can store energy comparable to a crossbow, and when it fractures, pieces can fly out with energy similar to bullets from a handgun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   **Avoid Brittle Materials** Do not press brittle materials like hardened steel, 7000 series aluminum, or spring-temper beryllium copper, as they will shatter instead of bending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Protective Guarding** If you must press hard materials, never approach the material's strength limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Always use a bulletproof guard, such as a half-inch lexan shield, to stop any fragments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Shattering is 100% probable if a hard, brittle material is pressed beyond its compressive strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.
*   **Unexpected Release** Some materials, like certain aluminum alloys, can suddenly jump up when bent, potentially flying into your face if held by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

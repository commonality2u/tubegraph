The Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange was invented by Almon Brown Strowger, an undertaker in Kansas City, in 1888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## The Problem: Biased Operators

Strowger's motivation for inventing the automatic exchange stemmed from a personal frustration with switchboard operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. He discovered that whenever someone called and asked for an undertaker, the operator would direct clients to a friend of hers, rather than to Strowger, despite there being only two undertakers in Kansas City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This meant all the business was going to his competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Driven by this anger, Strowger, who had no technical education but was considered a genius, decided to invent a machine that would render all phone operators obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## The Invention and Mechanism

Traditional phone exchanges of the era were matrices of jacks where an operator would manually plug in connections based on the call's destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Strowger's innovation was to imitate this motion by building a miniature matrix of connectors and using electromagnets to perform the operator's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

To achieve this, he had to invent several components, including the phone dial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The design of his phone dial has remained largely unchanged since his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. When the dial is turned, it sends electrical pulses on its return path, ensuring a constant rate of pulses regardless of how quickly a person pulls the dial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

The mechanical motion, driven by electromagnets, mimics a phone operator by moving in two dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. For a 100-customer exchange (the first one), dialing the first number would cause the mechanism to move up a row, and dialing the second digit would turn it to the correct column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This method selected the right connection from a 10x10 matrix, and when a call ended, the mechanism would return to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. For more than 100 phones, multiple selectors were used, with the first two digits selecting one, and subsequent digits selecting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Business and Legacy

Strowger proved to be a good businessman, forming the Strowger Automatic Telephone Company, which later merged to become the Automatic Electric Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Traces of his company still exist today, and he began manufacturing dial phones and these exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This particular design for telephone exchanges lasted for over 100 years and is still found in some countries, like in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Ten years after his business became successful, Strowger sold his shares in the company and returned to undertaking, which he continued for the rest of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

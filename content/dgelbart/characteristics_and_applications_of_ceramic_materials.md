Ceramic materials are often utilized in engineering when there's a need for very high temperature resistance or excellent electrical and thermal insulation properties. Examples include making heaters or crucibles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Machinable Ceramics

A good choice for R&D work requiring high temperature resistance and machinability are [[advantages_and_disadvantages_of_machinable_ceramics | machinable ceramics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. These materials can withstand high temperatures while still being machinable, comparable to [[differences_between_aluminum_alloys_and_their_applications | aluminum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Mica/Glass Composite (Macor/Mycalex)
*   **Properties:** This material, such as Mycalex, is a glass-mica composite that can withstand temperatures up to approximately 1,000°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. It can be filed similarly to metal, offering machinability comparable to [[differences_between_aluminum_alloys_and_their_applications | aluminum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. It maintains a very good finish and is stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Availability:** Unfortunately, this material is becoming rarer and more expensive as it's being phased out of the market, often replaced by more costly alternatives like Micro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Machinable Alumina
Machinable alumina is readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. It can be used in its machinable state and then fired to become very hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Boron Nitride (Hexagonal Form)
*   **Properties:** Sometimes referred to as "white graphite," hexagonal boron nitride offers fantastic lubricity, feeling almost oiled, and is self-lubricating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. It's excellent for bearings or sliding surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It can withstand very high temperatures, at least 1,500°C, and has a low thermal expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. It's easily machinable and not overly expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Limitations:** While great for applications not requiring high strength, it is not particularly strong or hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. It is completely inert and provides a beautiful finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Slate
*   **Properties:** Slate is a versatile and inexpensive ceramic material, commonly found in stone shops as polished panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. It's machinable, comparable in speed to boron nitride, Mycalex, or [[differences_between_aluminum_alloys_and_their_applications | aluminum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Slate can be sanded beautifully and cut perfectly with water jet technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Unlike [[properties_and_uses_of_polycarbonate_in_engineering | polycarbonate]], machinable ceramics (including slate) can be tapped and threaded without inserts, except for hard alumina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Limitations:** The main disadvantage is that if heated to nearly 1,000°C, slate will delaminate because it is a layered material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This is not an issue if the design does not require strength in that specific dimension, such as a heater panel clamped down with screws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Slate is currently the cheapest and best ceramic for general use, assuming its omnidirectional properties are not critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## Hardened Ceramics

Some ceramics are inherently very hard or can be hardened after machining.

### Hardened Alumina
*   **Properties:** Hardened alumina parts (pipes, plates, rods) are extremely hard and brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. They can ruin a file upon contact, indicating they are much harder than the file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Alumina is considered one of the strongest ceramics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Machining:** These parts cannot be filed and require diamond tooling for cutting or grinding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Zirconia
*   **Properties:** Zirconia is an exotic ceramic material with exceptionally high hardness, strength, and melting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. It is superior to alumina in strength and hardness, and it's also a perfect thermal insulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. It boasts nearly every "miracle property" combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Cost:** Zirconia is expensive, about 5-10 times more costly than other ceramics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Availability & Machining (Green-fired state):** For R&D work, zirconia can be obtained as "green-fired" or semi-fired blocks, often intended for dental crowns or other parts for teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. In this soft state, it can be machined with regular milling machines or files, similar to other machinable ceramics like [[differences_between_aluminum_alloys_and_their_applications | aluminum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Post-Firing:** After machining, these green-fired parts are sent to a dental lab to be fully fired or sintered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Once fired, zirconia becomes a material that cannot be machined at all except with diamond tooling; it will consume a file like hardened alumina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Its properties are very similar to tungsten carbide, and it can even cut steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Shrinkage:** A critical consideration for zirconia is its significant linear shrinkage during firing, often around 20-30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. This shrinkage is predictable and omnidirectional, but designers must scale all dimensions of the pre-fired part accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. A small amount of material (e.g., 0.1-0.2 mm) is typically left for post-firing diamond machining to account for slight uncertainties in shrinkage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

## Unique Properties of Glass

Glass exhibits a unique property that allows it to maintain its prismatic shape while being drawn to a thinner diameter when heated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

*   **Shape Retention:** Even complex shapes with sharp corners can be retained with an accuracy of about one micron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This process is predictable, and any inherent error in form retention is repeatable, allowing for pre-compensation in the initial grinding for sub-micron accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **Application:** This property is primarily used to manufacture miniature cylindrical lenses, such as aspheric, diffraction-limited, and spherically corrected lenses for lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. A large ground glass bar can be heated and drawn into hundreds of feet of these lenses, which are then cut and mounted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. This is considered the best process for manufacturing precise prismatic shapes (squares, triangles) or aspheric lenses in glass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

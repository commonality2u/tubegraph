When establishing a prototyping shop or lab, selecting a minimal but versatile supply of materials is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While the subject of materials is vast, a core set of plastics can cover a wide range of prototyping needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Recommended Plastics for Stock
A minimalistic list of plastics to keep in stock includes Polycarbonate (Lexan), Acetal (Delrin), Phenolic Laminate (Gite), Teflon, PVC, ABS, and Polyimide (Vespel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Polycarbonate (Lexan)
Polycarbonate, widely known by its trade name Lexan, is an excellent general-purpose plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Properties:**
    *   Completely shatter-proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
    *   Can withstand high temperatures (at least 100째C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Challenges:** [[challenges_of_forming_lexan_plastic | Forming Lexan]] can be challenging due to its resistance to bending without cracking, especially in certain alloys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Use:** Often requires [[plastic_mold_making_with_silicone_rubber | inserts]] for holding threads securely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### Acetal (Delrin)
Acetal, commonly known by its trade name Delrin, is a highly recommended plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Properties:**
    *   Machines very nicely compared to other plastics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
    *   Fairly inexpensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
    *   Readily available in various shapes (plate and rod) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

### Phenolic Laminate (Gite)
Phenolic laminate, sold under names like Gite, is an original plastic made from phenolic resin and cotton fabric layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Properties:**
    *   Does not easily deform with heat, making it resistant to "creep" (deformation below melting point) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
    *   Does not break easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
    *   Machines beautifully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
    *   Holds threads very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
    *   Can absorb oil, providing self-lubrication for moving parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Uses:** Heavily used in gears and bearings where a steel gear running against a phenolic gear offers long-lasting, quiet operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Strong enough for gear teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

### Teflon
Teflon is known for its unique properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **Properties:**
    *   Good lubricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
    *   Stands relatively high temperatures (up to almost 200째C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
    *   Weak material that cold flows easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
    *   Does not hold threads well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
    *   Excellent electrical properties, making it useful for RF work and high-frequency applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   **Uses:** Occasionally used for bushings that are not highly loaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### PVC and ABS
PVC and ABS are inexpensive and widely available plastics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Properties:**
    *   Can be easily glued together using solvent-based glues, creating very strong joints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
    *   Low-temperature materials, becoming weak at around 70-80째C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
    *   Do not hold threads well, requiring [[plastic_mold_making_with_silicone_rubber | inserts]] like those used for Lexan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Uses:** Ideal for making large, inexpensive enclosures, tanks, or structures, especially when metal is not an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Widely available in pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Polyimide (Vespel)
Polyimide, known by the trade name Vespel (made by DuPont), is an exotic and very useful, though expensive, plastic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Properties:**
    *   Highest temperature-rated polymer, with tape versions usable up to 300째C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
    *   Excellent for electrical insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
    *   Has good cut-through resistance, preventing electrical insulation from being slowly cut through by sharp corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
    *   Holds threads very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
    *   Very rigid and does not distort, holding shapes well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
    *   Available in virgin (brown) or filled versions (with carbon, moly, or other materials) to enhance bearing properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Cost:** Terribly expensive, with even small pieces costing hundreds of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.
*   **Uses:** Essential when a part requires high mechanical strength, excellent insulation, and high-temperature resistance where no other choice exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

## General Considerations for Plastics
When using plastics in prototyping, particularly in [[challenges_of_using_plastics_in_prototyping | applications with close proximity to other materials]], be aware that some plastics can crack when exposed to vapors from certain materials like Loctite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

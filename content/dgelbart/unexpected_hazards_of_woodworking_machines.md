Surprisingly, the most dangerous machine in a machine shop is often a woodworking machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. While understanding the basic [[safety_rules_in_workshops | safety rules in workshops]] is crucial, specific unexpected hazards related to woodworking machinery require additional attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Reasons for Danger
Woodworking machinery operates at very high speeds, typically ten times the surface speed of metalworking tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The tools are also exceptionally sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This combination significantly increases the chances of severe injury, such as cutting off a finger, which can happen in a fraction of a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Even when a blade appears to be almost stopped, it can still cause serious injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Safety Precautions for Woodworking Machines

### General Blade Safety
*   **Maintain Distance**: Always stay clear of the blade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Push Sticks for Lengthwise Cuts**: If cutting wood lengthwise and your hand approaches the blade, use a push stick or similar tool to guide the wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Never use your hand directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Push Sticks for Small Pieces**: For small pieces of wood, always use a push stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Positional Safety
*   **Never Stand Behind the Blade**: Do not stand behind the blade, especially if tempted to pull a long piece of wood from the other side after a cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. If anything gets stuck, the blade can pull the wood and your hand directly into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Work from the Front**: Always work from the front side of the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Keep Hands Far**: Always keep your hands far from the blade, utilizing appropriate tools like push sticks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> Woodworking machines are extremely dangerous, even when the blade appears to be nearly stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

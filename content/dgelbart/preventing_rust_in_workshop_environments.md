Protecting tools and machinery from rust is crucial for their longevity and performance in a workshop environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Rusting is a chemical process that can be influenced by pH levels and moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

## Advanced Rust Protection

### Electroless Nickel Plating
Electroless nickel plating offers an excellent way to protect items from rust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. This method also makes the surface harder than any steel, reaching about Rockwell C70, which prevents wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. For instance, a sander's tables that were electroless nickel coated 25 years ago have withstood continuous use and abrasive conditions without rusting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. However, this method may not be feasible for large machines or components that cannot be easily disassembled for plating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

## Understanding Rust Chemistry

Rust occurs when there is an acidic pH (lower than seven) and moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. While moisture alone will cause slow rusting, an acidic environment significantly accelerates the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Conversely, an alkaline pH (above seven) prevents rust, even in the presence of moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. A common example is steel wool pads used for scrubbing dishes, which remain rust-free as long as the alkaline soap is present, but rust quickly once it's washed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

## General Rust Prevention Methods

### Humidity Control
Maintaining the room's humidity below approximately 40% can prevent items from rusting, even if they are not oiled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. Installing a dehumidifier is an effective way to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

### Oiling
Applying oil provides rust protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Silicone oil is recommended over regular hydrocarbon-based oils or grease because it adheres tenaciously to metal and creeps into areas that were not directly oiled due to its strong wetting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

## Rust Prevention for Specific Equipment

### [[woodworking_machine_hazards | Woodworking Machines]]
Oiling is often undesirable for [[woodworking_machine_hazards | woodworking machines]] as wood dust can stick to the oiled surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. For such machinery, alternative rust prevention strategies include:
*   **Dehumidifiers:** Ensuring low humidity in the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.
*   **Alkaline Wipe-Down:** Periodically wiping the machine with a rag soaked in a mild sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. This leaves a fine, white film that does not collect dust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. Should the machine get wet, the NaOH in the film will dissolve, forming an alkaline solution that protects against rust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. Gloves should be worn when handling NaOH solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

## Materials to Avoid in a Workshop

Certain substances can cause widespread rust in a workshop environment due to their airborne molecules:

*   **Acids:** Keeping bottles of acids (e.g., nitric, hydrochloric, sulfuric) in the shop can lead to rust on all metal surfaces, even if the bottles are tightly closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Plastic caps are not hermetic, allowing acid molecules to escape and acidify the air, lowering the pH below seven and causing rust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. Acids should be stored outside the workshop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.
*   **Chlorine-Releasing Materials:** Substances that release chlorine, such as bleach or molten salt baths used for heat treatment, should never be used or stored in a workshop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Exposure to these can cause rapid rusting of machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

This article explores various pieces of homemade equipment and innovative modifications found within a private shop and lab, which is divided into four main zones: a high-precision area, a general machine shop with CNC machines, a dirty work room (for tasks like welding and woodworking), and a testing lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## High Precision Area

The high-precision area features machines designed for extreme accuracy.

### Moor Number Three Jig Borer
The Moor Number 3 Jig Borer is an "amazing machine" due to its accuracy of approximately 1 micron (40 millionths of an inch) in all aspects, including orthogonality of axes, straightness of motions, calibration of lead screws, and trueness of rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This precision is achieved through meticulous design, such as using Invar for the headstock (a metal that doesn't change size with temperature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, proper heat shielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, and even workers wearing aluminized aprons during final scraping to prevent body heat from distorting the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Despite their original high cost, these machines can now be purchased on eBay for a fraction of their original price due to a decline in their industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Accessories for Precision
*   **Video Microscope:** To precisely locate features (like a dust speck or an edge) to within one micron, a video microscope is used. The most reliable method involves rotating the microscope to align the target with the true axis of rotation of the machine, minimizing run-out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Rotary Tables / Dividing Heads:** These provide amazing angular accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   A two-axis rotary table with optical readouts is accurate to about one to two arc seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   The "Ultra Dex" is considered the most accurate dividing device in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It uses two phase gears with 360 teeth that mesh every one degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Its high accuracy (a tenth of an arc second) is achieved because repeated meshing wears out high spots, averaging all 360 positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Crucially, it doesn't rely on bearing accuracy; the meshed gears define the center of rotation, preventing errors from wandering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   Other tools include a granite table, an autocollimator, electronic gauges, air bearing gauges, a watchmaker's lathe (valued for its specialized collets and gripping arrangements), and a micromill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Bootstrapping and Shop Design Philosophy

The current shop is a purpose-built facility with 250 tons of concrete and an ideal layout for a machine shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Features include floor-level garbage cans for easy sweeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a> and a ventilation system that maintains different air pressures in each of the three separate rooms: the dirty room has the lowest pressure, and the clean room has the highest, ensuring dust and humidity migrate towards the dirty areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

However, the shop's origins involved a "bootstrapping" approach due to zero funds, with many early machines being self-built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Homemade Sheet Metal Brake
One of the first machines built 50 years ago was a sheet metal brake. It was constructed from four-inch by half-inch cold-rolled steel bars, cut and drilled by hand, then welded and case-hardened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. The design features a clamping mechanism on top and two eccentrics coupled by a belt, which move the clamping blade in and out to adjust for different material thicknesses and bend radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. It still operates effectively 50 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Homemade Spot Welder
Built from leftover material from the sheet metal brake (the same four-inch by half-inch bar), this [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | spot welder]] exemplifies bootstrapping. Its initial part, with rails, was made first and then used to [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | spot weld]] the housing for the machine itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## [[Modifications for milling machines | Modifications for Lathes and Mills]]

The shop features a Makino K55 mill, a Wasino lathe, and other manual machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Several useful modifications have been made to save time and improve precision.

### Lathe Modifications
*   **Video Microscope:** A video microscope, adapted from a car rearview camera kit, provides over 100x magnification of the tool tip for precise alignment, particularly useful when re-cutting threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   **Chuck to Remove Run-out:** This significant [[modifications_for_milling_machines | modification]] allows the removal of run-out without re-clamping. Unlike commercially available "grip-through" chucks that lose accuracy upon clamping, this custom chuck uses a standard self-centering four-jaw chuck mounted on a massive ground and lapped steel plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This plate sits between two other large ground and lapped steel plates and can be moved by eccentrics without losing rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. This enables adjustment of run-out to the accuracy of the lathe's bearings (better than a collet) and can compensate for run-out at any point along a long bar, not just at the chuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

### Mill Modifications
On a small Jet mill (primarily used as a drill) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>:
*   A laser center finder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   A depth stop with a sliding nut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
*   A milling vice with retractable stops to eliminate the need for blocks when clamping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.
*   A variable frequency drive (VFD) for variable speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
*   Standardization on a single 3/4-inch collet size for all tooling, eliminating the need to change collets frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

## [[Specialty hardware and tooling | Specialty Hardware and Tooling]]

The shop maintains a comprehensive inventory of hardware, including hard-to-find [[specialty_hardware_and_tooling | specialty items]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>:
*   Weldable hardware (standoffs, nuts, pins) that pair well with a [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | spot welder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.
*   A selection of miniature screws, rivets, and eyelets, useful for electronic work and small models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.
*   "Scale screws" designed for model building, where the proportions of the head to the body match those of large bolts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.
*   "Cut nails" for a better aesthetic finish compared to pressed nails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
*   Low head and ultra-low head socket head screws, as well as undercut flat head screws for thin sheet metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
*   Bendable metal strips (from Japan) as an alternative to tie-wraps for securing electrical wires, allowing for easy removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

## Dirty Work Room

This area is dedicated to operations like grinding, sanding, and welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. It houses a surface grinder, an Omax waterjet cutter, and various sanders and grinders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

### Anvil Modification
To eliminate the loud ringing common in hardened steel anvils, lead sheets are laminated to the sides with contact cement. This effectively "kills all the ringing" while maintaining the anvil's proper bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

### Homemade Furnaces and Ovens
Several furnaces and ovens, mostly homemade, are used for heat treating steels and similar materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
*   **First Homemade Oven:** Built 50 years ago with limited funds, its temperature was controlled by a converted airplane instrument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.
*   **Inert Gas / Carburizing Atmosphere Oven:** This oven addresses the issue of oxidation and decarburization (loss of carbon from the surface) that occurs when heat treating steels in conventional ovens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. It operates by dripping methanol (methyl alcohol) into the oven at about five to ten drops per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. Above 400Â°C, the methanol decomposes into a mixture of gases that provide both a reducing atmosphere (removing oxide) and a carburizing atmosphere (adding carbon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. This results in shiny parts with no surface carbon loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.

    This particular oven, designed for air-hardening tool steels, has a hot zone and a cold zone separated by insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Parts are placed in a "boat" that can be moved between zones without opening the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. The cold zone has a water-filled jacket to ensure rapid cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. Upon opening, a large blue flame shoots out due to the ignition of residual methanol vapor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>.

### Fluidized Bed Coater
Used for critical coating applications, a [[unique_machine_components_and_design | fluidized bed coater]] suspends powder in a gas (air) to make it behave like a liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. When a hot part is dipped into this fluidized bed, the powder melts and adheres, coating not only the outside but also the inside of hollow parts, unlike conventional powder coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. This prevents internal rusting, a common issue with outdoor furniture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

Other equipment includes a high-temperature furnace for sintering ceramics like aluminum oxide or zirconia, essential for parts needing high temperature resistance, electrical insulation, or thermal insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

## Testing Lab / Clean Room

This room is primarily for testing and electronic work, designed to function as a semi-clean room with positive air pressure and filtered doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.

### Laser Welder
A surprisingly useful, albeit expensive, machine (around $20,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. It can weld almost any metal to any other metal without inert gas because the weld occurs in milliseconds, preventing oxidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. The work is viewed through a microscope, and the laser beam is coaxial with the visible light, allowing welding at the bottom of deep holes or other inaccessible spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. It's also used for temporary attachments, such as securing nuts to screws with a tiny, adjustable-power weld that can be sheared if removal is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>. This method is superior to Loctite for high-temperature or corrosive environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

### Miniature Spot Welder
A scaled-down version of the larger homemade spot welder, this miniature device is very handy for small-scale work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

### Homemade Laser Cutter and Engraver
Similar to commercial units, this is a homemade laser cutter and engraver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.

### Homemade Diamond Wire Saw
This machine functions like a bandsaw for cutting glass and ceramics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. It includes accessories like a chuck for holding and rotating glass to cut round discs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. Many of its parts were cut on the [[modifications_to_improve_waterjet_cutter_productivity | waterjet cutter]] and then minimally machined for accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>.

### Electronic Test Equipment
The lab is equipped with a range of electronic test equipment, mostly one generation old but preferred for its simplicity and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. Many of these sophisticated tools, like the HP 3577A network analyzer (originally tens of thousands of dollars), can be purchased on eBay for only a few hundred dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. A network analyzer can measure transfer functions of servo systems and plot characteristics of high-speed actuators, making it useful beyond just electronic work for mechanical engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.

A laser center finder is a highly useful accessory for drill mills and other machine tools, though it is not commercially available and must be self-made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Construction and Mounting
A laser center finder is typically constructed from the head of a laser pointer, with its lens adjusted to focus at the desired working distance, and a battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. It is designed to clip onto a chuck or directly onto the shank of a collet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Operation and Applications
When activated, the device projects a circle of light, with the center of this circle precisely aligning with the machine's axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Key applications include:
*   **Lining up with marks** This tool makes it very easy to align the machine's spindle with a specific mark or feature on a workpiece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Finding centers of features** The spot can be expanded to a larger size to assist in finding the exact center of a marked area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Aligning with holes or pins** It is particularly useful for aligning the spindle with the center of an existing hole or pin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
    *   By moving the spindle, the projected circle of light forms a ring around a feature like a boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
    *   The position of this ring is highly sensitive to misalignment; even slight movements of the spindle will cause the ring to shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   Adjusting until the ring of light appears perfectly horizontal indicates that the spindle is centered to the hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Cross-drilling** For cross-drilling, the spindle is aligned until the light beam is broken at both ends simultaneously, forming a 'V' shape on both sides, which indicates centering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Accuracy
This simple device can achieve an alignment accuracy of approximately 50 microns in a very short amount of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### DIY Construction
Since it is not commercially available, the laser center finder must be self-made, often using a [[Using laser pointers for precision in waterjet cutting | waterjet]] machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

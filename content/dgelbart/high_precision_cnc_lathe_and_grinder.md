This article details a scratch-built, very high precision lathe and grinder machine developed by Dan Gart. It is capable of cutting, turning, and grinding parts to an accuracy of [[achieving_one_micron_accuracy | one micron]] (40 millionths of an inch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Applications and Precision
The machine's high accuracy enables the creation of components with exceptional fits and performance. An example demonstrated is a cylinder and piston assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The piston achieves a completely sliding fit within the cylinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> and becomes airtight when the air vent is sealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

A notable property of such precise manufacturing is the frictionless spinning of the piston within the cylinder, mimicking a self-acting air bearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This means a bearing made with this precision would never require lubrication and would not wear out due to a lack of contact between inner and outer parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This concept is similar to air bearings found in hard drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Parts produced on this machine achieve the required fit directly, without the need for time-consuming lapping processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Machine Construction and Features
The machine is a full [[customized_cnc_software | CNC]] machine, with the physical components built from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The [[customized_cnc_software | CNC software]] was developed by engineer James Midley from Vancouver, BC, as standard software packages could not accommodate the machine's dual lathe and grinder functions, along with other specialized features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Chuck Design
The chuck features an unusual design based on an extinct American design by Skinner Chuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Watertight Operation:** It remains completely watertight whether the jaws are open or closed, achieved by drive pins that move the jaws and a slot covered by the jaw itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Pin Gripping:** Designed for very small loads, the chuck can grip parts using inserted pins on either the inner (ID) or outer (OD) diameter without needing to change jaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Wide Gripping Range:** These pins, combined with the regular jaw gripping range, allow the chuck to grip anything from zero to approximately 200 mm in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Runout Adjustment:** Two screws allow for zeroing the chuck's runout, which is critical for removing and re-inserting a job while maintaining a reference surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Tailstock
The tailstock is also mounted on air bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> and has a very long travel of about 300 mm, from being fully inside to fully extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This enables a very long center distance (almost 600 mm) for a relatively small lathe, even longer if the bar can go inside the tailstock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Air Bearings
All major moving parts of the machine float on air bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, including:
*   The saddle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>
*   The crosslide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   The main spindle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>
*   The grinding spindle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>
The air bearings for the main and grinder spindles are not scratch-built but are surplus units from semiconductor machinery, which are very economical to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Crosslide and Grinding Capabilities
The crosslide has sufficient travel to accommodate both lathe tooling and the grinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. It can be moved forward for lathe work or back for grinding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The machine also supports internal grinding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>:
*   The external grinding wheel is removable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   Collet adapters can be used to hold internal wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   Direct-mount internal grinding wheels can be threaded onto the spindle for more rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   Custom internal grinding wheels can be made by cutting shapes from used grinding stones with a waterjet cutter and bonding them with epoxy onto a shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This allows access to the full range of wheel materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Bed Accuracy
[[achieving_one_micron_accuracy | Achieving one micron accuracy]] requires a very good bed and spindles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The bed is constructed using economically sourced granite parallels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   These granite bars have all four sides parallel to a micron over their entire length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   The bed is built by bonding these bars with epoxy, forming T-shapes and then two T-shapes to form the complete bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   During assembly, the structure is flipped upside down on a granite table with accurate spacers, ensuring co-planarity and an accurate gap to a micron once the epoxy cures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   The glue joints are held under compression by large bolts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This is because epoxy is very strong in pure shear but weak in other modes, so compression ensures the epoxy is primarily subjected to shear stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Additional Features
*   **Manual Mode:** If the [[customized_cnc_software | CNC software]] encounters an issue, the lathe can be operated manually with digital readouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Built-in Microscope:** A microscope can be placed on the machine for small work, with the view displayed on a screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Demonstrations
The video demonstrates two [[high_precision_machining_techniques | high precision machining techniques]]:
*   **Thread Cutting:** The machine cuts a thread, with the magnified cutting action visible through a video camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Grinding:** The machine is programmed for multi-pass grinding, with coolant flowing and the grinding wheel progressively taking off metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Minimal splashing from the coolant is observed due to the small flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

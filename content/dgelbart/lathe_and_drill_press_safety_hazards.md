While basic [[workshop_safety_rules | workshop safety rules]] should always be followed, this article focuses on unexpected safety hazards associated with lathes and drill presses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It is assumed that users are already aware of general machine safety hazards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Lathe Safety Hazards

Lathes are generally considered fairly safe machines, but they present two primary unexpected dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### Entanglement with Rotating Parts

A significant hazard arises from touching rotating parts, especially threads, with fingers, rags, or loose clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

*   **Internal Threads**: If a finger touches an internal thread while the lathe is turning, it can pull the finger in and shear it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This occurs because the thread will lock onto the finger, making it impossible to pull out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **External Rotating Parts and Rags**: Touching the outside of rotating objects with a piece of rag is also very dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The rag can get wrapped around the part and pull the hand into the lathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Loose Clothing/Hair/Wires**: Any loose sleeves, earphone wires, long hair, or anything else hanging off a person that touches a rotating part will wrap around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Once wrapped, the "capstan effect" locks it in, making it impossible to let go, pulling the person into the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

Therefore, the first rule of lathe safety is never to touch anything rotating with rags, hands, or anything that can be pulled into the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### Working with Brass

The second unexpected danger in a lathe is when working with brass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Brass has a tendency to pull the tool into the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

*   **Tool Geometry**: Normally, special lathe tools ground for brass have a zero rake angle, meaning the cutting edge touches the brass squarely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Drills used for brass have a flat ground at the end to ensure the helix angle doesn't create a sharp angle with the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Pull-in Hazard**: If these specialized tools are not used, the lathe tool can be pulled into the chuck, or a drill can pull the drilling chuck out of the tailstock into the brass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. If the hole is deep enough, the chuck can be pulled out entirely and sent flying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## Drill Press Safety Hazards

A drill press is a fairly safe machine, but certain precautions are critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

### Clamping the Part

The primary concern when using a drill press is properly clamping the part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

*   **Vice Use**: For most parts, it is easy to clamp them in a vice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. When drilling, it's advisable to start the hole with a [[basics_of_drilling_and_center_punching | center drill]] to guide the main drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. For very large drills (e.g., >10mm), it's best to drill in two steps, first with a smaller diameter and then enlarging it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Awkward Shapes**: If a part is too awkward to place in a vice, never hold it in your hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. The drill can catch the part, causing it to spin and cut your hand if it has sharp edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Instead, use a locking plier, such as a vice grip, to hold the part securely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Drill at a slower speed to allow for quicker reaction if something goes wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Drilling Brass

The dangers of drilling brass on a lathe also apply to a drill press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. When drilling through brass, the drill can pull the material upwards as it breaks through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. If the piece is not very secure, it can be pulled out of the vice, or the chuck can be pulled out of the drill press if it's not properly secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

### Rags Under Material

An unexpected and extremely dangerous practice is placing a rag under the material being drilled to protect the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

*   **Rag Entanglement**: As soon as the drill breaks through the material, it will touch the rag, and the rag will wrap around the drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. This is a 100% probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Once wrapped, the rag and everything else will fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Safe Alternative**: Never place anything under the material that can wrap around the drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. To protect the surface, use a sheet of paper instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. The drill will go through the paper, but the paper will not wrap around because it lacks fibers that can entangle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

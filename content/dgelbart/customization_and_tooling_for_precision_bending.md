The press brake is a versatile machine used for [[techniques_for_bending_metal | bending metal]], with different sections often dedicated to specific functions. One side might be for regular bends, another for custom bends and [[specialty_hardware_and_tooling | custom tooling]], and a third for flattening dies, acting as an "undo" button for incorrect bends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Bending Operations

### Setting Up a Bend
Bends are typically set up using a digital gauge, though manual gauges are also effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The machine adjusts automatically once the desired bend is input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Undoing a Bend
While a [[press_tooling_and_alignment_techniques | press brake]] has an "undo" function for flattening, it's difficult to achieve a perfect flat surface again due to the enormous pressure required for metal to flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Simply undoing a bend will leave a mark or ridge because the metal work-hardens, making it harder to flatten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. To undo a bend cleanly without leaving a mark, the metal must be annealed by heating it to red hot with a butane torch before flattening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Factors Affecting Bending Capacity
The thickness and width of the metal, along with the opening of the die, are the three main parameters that determine how thick a metal can be bent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. For example, a 24-ton [[press_tooling_and_alignment_techniques | press brake]] can bend full-width gauge 12 steel (just under 3mm) using a specific die, but thicker material can be bent with a wider V-die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. For general use without constantly changing tools, leaving a 3/4-inch die is recommended as it allows for bending quite thick material in narrow sections and about 2.5 to 3mm material across the full width for steel. Aluminum generally allows for bending thicker material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Adjusting Bend Angle
Standard [[press_tooling_and_alignment_techniques | press brakes]] often come with a rear adjustment for bending angles less than 90 degrees, which can be inconvenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. A more convenient solution is to add a front adjustment using an air valve that shuts off the air when the desired depth is reached, allowing for easy adjustment to angles like 45 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Radius Bends
To create a radius bend instead of a sharp one, a piece of scrap metal can be bent first and used to give a radius to the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Alternatively, a set of radius tools can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Magnets can be installed in these tools to help them stick to the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Specialized Tooling and Modifications

### Gooseneck Tool
A gooseneck tool has a distinct profile compared to a regular V-bottom tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Its primary advantage is allowing the bending of narrow channels (e.g., 10x10x10 mm U-channels) that would otherwise interfere with the brake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This is particularly useful in [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | prototyping]] where many parts are small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Tool for Deeper Channels
Special tools with a hole can be made to bend very deep U-shapes, deeper than their width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. These tools can be custom-made using a [[high_precision_machining_techniques | water jet]] by cutting a long bar into pieces of various lengths (e.g., 1-inch, 2-inch, 3-inch) or a smarter [[bending_order_and_techniques_for_enclosure_assembly | bend order]] to minimize the number of pieces needed for any dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Table for Narrow Strips
A self-made or bought table with marks is useful for bending narrow strips, ensuring they are squared properly against the stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Sliding Tube Finger Modification
A highly useful modification for the brake's fingers (stops) involves narrowing the original round bar and then putting a sliding tube over it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This allows the finger to be very narrow for small bends while providing a wider resting area when the part is farther away, preventing missed alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The tube slides back when pushing in a narrow tongue, staying flush with the narrowed bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Stiffening Brackets
For [[design_and_preparation_of_sheet_metal_enclosures | Design and Preparation of Sheet Metal Enclosures]] and fabrication, brackets are common but can be flimsy. Several methods exist to make them rigid:

1.  **Simple Brace:** A simple brace can be bent and spot-welded to the bracket. To ensure accuracy, it's best to hold the brace against a square while spot-welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
2.  **Triangular Stiffener:** A triangular stiffener piece, bent square on two sides, can be inserted into the bracket and spot-welded. This method doesn't require a square during welding because the triangular piece itself is pre-bent square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
3.  **Bent-in Rib:** For very simple, stiff brackets where space is limited, a rib can be bent directly into the bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This is achieved by leaving a space between two segments on the brake and inserting a hardened steel blade with a rounded top, positioned flush with the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. As the main bend is made, the blade simultaneously creates the rib, which provides immense stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This demonstrates a high level of [[precision_and_adjustability_in_mechanical_components | precision and adjustability in mechanical components]] in manufacturing.

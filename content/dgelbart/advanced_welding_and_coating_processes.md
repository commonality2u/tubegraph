The shop and lab features dedicated areas for various manufacturing processes, including those for welding and coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Welding Equipment

A homemade [[spot_welding_basics_and_setup | spot welder]] was constructed from a 4-inch by half-inch cold-rolled steel bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This machine was even used to [[spot_welding_basics_and_setup | spot weld]] its own housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The shop also stocks [[material_compatibility_with_spot_welding | weldable hardware]] such as standoffs, nuts, and pins, which pair well with a [[spot_welding_basics_and_setup | spot welder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

### Laser Welder

A laser welder is described as a surprisingly useful, albeit expensive, machine, costing around twenty thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. Key advantages include:
*   **Versatility**: It can weld almost any metal to any other metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
*   **Speed**: Welding takes place in milliseconds (up to 20 milliseconds), which prevents metal oxidation, eliminating the need for inert gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.
*   **Accessibility**: Welding can be done in deep holes or hard-to-reach areas because only the laser beam needs to reach the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. The laser light is coaxial with the visible light in the microscope used for viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>.
*   **Temporary Attachments**: It can be used for [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | temporarily attaching]] small components, such as securing a nut to a screw with a tiny weld that can be sheared if removal is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>. The power is adjustable for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>.
*   **Durability**: Unlike Loctite, laser welds are not affected by high temperatures, corrosive chemicals, or radiation, as they are made of the same base metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.
*   **[[material_compatibility_with_spot_welding | Dissimilar Metal Welding]]**: The short energy deposition time makes it possible to weld [[material_compatibility_with_spot_welding | dissimilar metals]] like copper to steel or silver to copper, as the metal's heat conductivity becomes less of a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.

### Miniature Spot Welder

A miniature [[spot_welding_basics_and_setup | spot welder]] is available, functioning similarly to larger models but on a smaller scale, making it very handy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

### Plasma Needle Arc Welder

The welding corner also includes a plasma needle arc welder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

### Induction Heater

An induction heater is a valuable and surprisingly inexpensive tool, available new for around a thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. It can heat a steel bar to red hot for [[brazing_versus_welding | brazing]], bending, or forging in seconds, much faster than a torch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.

## Coating Processes

The "dirty operations" room houses several furnaces and ovens, primarily for heat treating steels and powder coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

### Inert Gas / Carburizing Oven

This oven addresses the issue of oxidation and decarburization (loss of carbon from the surface) that occurs when hardening or heat-treating steels, which otherwise requires grinding off material to reach full hardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

The oven provides a non-oxidizing or slightly carburizing and reducing atmosphere, ensuring parts emerge shiny with no carbon loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. While typically achieved with vacuum ovens pumping inert or reducing gas, this oven uses an unconventional trick:
*   **Methanol Drip**: Methanol (methyl alcohol) is dripped into the oven at about 5-10 drops per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
*   **Decomposition**: Above 400 degrees Celsius, methanol decomposes into gases with the correct reducing properties (removing oxide) and carbon-adding capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.
*   **Hot and Cold Zones**: This specific oven for air-hardening tool steels features a hot zone and a water-jacketed cold zone, allowing parts to be moved between them without opening the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. After heat treatment, parts are moved to the cold zone to cool completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

### Fluidized Bed Coater

Used for more critical coating applications than standard powder coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>, a fluidized bed coater contains powder that is made to behave like a liquid by pumping air through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. When a hot object is dipped into the fluidized powder, the powder melts and adheres to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. The main advantage is its ability to coat the *inside* of hollow parts like pipes, unlike powder coating which only coats the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. This prevents internal rusting, a common issue with outdoor furniture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. The liquid-like behavior of the powder allows it to flow through internal passages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.

### High-Temperature Furnace for Ceramics

A high-temperature furnace is available for processing ceramics and sintering materials like alumina or zirconia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. These materials are crucial when a part needs to withstand very high temperatures, act as an electrical insulator, or serve as a thermal insulator, and have no suitable substitutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. Parts are typically machined in a soft state before being put into the furnace for sintering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.

Spot welding is a versatile technique, particularly useful in [[applications_of_spot_welding_in_prototyping_and_manufacturing | prototyping]] and manufacturing. While machines can be homemade, they generally operate on similar principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Spot Welder Operation and Settings

A spot welder creates a weld by passing current through metals that do not conduct electricity well, causing them to heat up significantly (IÂ²R heating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Key Settings
*   **Time** The most crucial setting, adjusted based on metal thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Pressure** Set to maximum and generally left there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.
*   **Current** Always set to the maximum possible current. Adjusting time is preferred over current, as higher current with shorter times minimizes heat escape sideways, resulting in better welds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. Only reduce current if the lowest time setting is still too high for very thin materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

### Capacity
A 15 KVA unit is a minimum recommendation, capable of welding 3mm to 3mm (approximately 12 gauge to 12 gauge) mild steel or 10 gauge to 10 gauge stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Units up to 25 KVA can weld slightly thicker gauges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. Spot welding is ideal for thicknesses where TIG welding becomes difficult; conversely, where spot welding reaches its limit, TIG welding becomes easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

### Safety Precautions
*   Wear goggles or glasses, as the process can produce sparks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   Avoid wearing sandals, as molten metal may drip and cause burns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   While voltage is low (around 2.5 volts), high amperage (5,000 amps) creates significant magnetic forces that can attract metallic or magnetic objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

## Testing and Material Compatibility

### Determining Settings (Tear Test)
To find the correct time setting for sheet metal, make several test welds on two pieces of scrap metal at different time settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. Then, perform a tear test: the metal should tear without the weld opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. For example, 0.7mm (22 gauge) sheet metal required a setting of two cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. After a few uses, you can create a chart for different materials like stainless steel and mild steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

### Weldable Materials
Spot welders are typically used for:
*   Mild steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>
*   Stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>
*   Exotic metals such as tungsten, titanium, and niobium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>

### Non-Weldable Materials
Non-ferrous metals like copper, phosphor bronze, and beryllium copper generally cannot be directly spot welded because they conduct electricity too well, preventing the necessary resistance heating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

### Welding Non-Weldable Materials (Trapping)
To weld non-ferrous or difficult-to-weld materials like Nitinol, you can trap them between two layers of weldable material, typically stainless steel. The weld then goes across the non-weldable material and fuses the stainless steel layers, effectively securing the trapped material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This technique is strong, forming a strange alloy in between that creates a cohesive piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. It's advisable to bend the ends of the trapped material to create a gradual radius, avoiding abrupt transitions that could create weak points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

## Types of Welds

### Temporary vs. Permanent Welds
*   **Temporary Welds** (e.g., 1 cycle for 0.7mm steel) are weak and can be broken off by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This is highly useful for [[applications_of_spot_welding_in_prototyping_and_manufacturing | prototyping]] to position parts before making permanent welds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
*   **Permanent Welds** (e.g., 2 cycles for 0.7mm steel) are strong and cannot be easily twisted or pried apart without tearing the metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. To open a permanent weld, it must be drilled out, usually with a 3-4mm drill bit, as the weld itself creates a center mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

### Invisible Welds
To achieve an invisible weld, especially for aesthetic or cleanliness reasons (e.g., medical devices), standard flat electrodes are insufficient as they cause slight inward pulling upon solidification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. A special electrode with a small, shallow dimple (e.g., a few millimeters in diameter, 50 microns deep) at the weld point is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This dimple pushes the metal out by the exact amount it shrinks upon cooling, resulting in a perfectly flat surface that requires minimal or no sanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Welding Rods and Wire

Spot welding is highly efficient for welding rods or wire due to the small contact area, which results in very high current density and efficient heat retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. A 15 KVA unit can easily weld 3/8" or even 1/2" rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

### Testing Rod Welds
The test for rod welds is similar to sheet metal: twist the rod, and the weld should not open; instead, the rod itself should shear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. This capability makes spot welding ideal for [[designing_with_wire_and_sheet_metal | designing with wire]] and creating wire structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

## Welding Captive Hardware

Spot welding is excellent for attaching various types of captive hardware, providing a secure and permanent bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

### Types of Hardware
*   **Hinges**: Can be spot welded to create hinged covers or boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.
*   **Nuts**:
    *   **Spot welding nuts**: These have three projections and a pilot shoulder for accurate alignment in a pre-cut hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. They are welded using two flat electrodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Plain washers/pieces**: For sheet metal too thin to tap, a plain piece or washer can be spot welded to the back to double the thickness, allowing for tapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>.
*   **Studs**:
    *   **Spot weldable studs**: These have a small pip or point at the end that aligns with a small mark (e.g., from a water jet cutter or 1mm drill hole) on the sheet metal for accurate placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. Requires hollow electrodes tailored to screw sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.
    *   **Standard round-head screws**: Can be welded almost as effectively as dedicated studs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.
*   **Standoffs**: Threaded standoffs can be spot welded using the same holders as studs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>.
*   **Latches and Closures**: Various other spot weldable hardware items are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>.

### Welding Balls
Spot welding balls is highly effective for creating kinematic mounts, couplings, or adjustable mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. A conical hole electrode is used to hold the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>. When welding a ball to the end of a rod, a special collet adapter grips the rod, ensuring the ball can be removed after welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>. For welding a ball to a flat surface (e.g., for an omnidirectional pivot), a low setting is typically used due to the small contact area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>. The conical adapter usually contacts the ball in a ring, but with sufficient contact area between the copper electrode and the ball, it melts the ball at the bottom without leaving marks on its functional surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

## Specialty Techniques

### Watertight Enclosures
To create watertight enclosures, a thin bead of RTV silicone is spread between the metal pieces, and then spot welds are made through it at a dense pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:35:00">[28:35:00]</a>. The welding pressure displaces the silicone, allowing the weld to form while the remaining silicone creates a seal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:54:00">[28:54:00]</a>.

### Salvaging Material for Water Jet Cutting
Spot welding can extend small pieces of material for water jet cutting. If the material is thin, pieces can be overlapped and welded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:02:00">[30:02:00]</a>. For thicker materials, they can be butt-welded flush at the joint. This horizontal melt creates a smooth, step-free joint strong enough for gripping in a water jet cutter, even if not a strong structural weld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:08:00">[30:08:00]</a>.

## [[creating_custom_electrodes_for_specific_welding_needs | Creating Custom Electrodes]]

Many spot welding jobs require [[creating_custom_electrodes_for_specific_welding_needs | custom electrodes]]. Electrodes are typically made from copper bar stock (square or round) due to copper's malleability and work-hardening properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:15:00">[23:15:00]</a>.

### Electrode Tips
For long-lasting tips, inserts made from copper-tungsten alloy or, more commonly, copper-chrome alloy are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:00">[23:53:00]</a>. These are machined with a taper and pressed into a tapered hole in the copper electrode body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:18:00">[24:18:00]</a>. The tapered hole can be made using a "dbit" (a dowel pin ground taper and flat) as a milling cutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:32:00">[24:32:00]</a>. Precision isn't critical, as the soft copper will flow to accommodate the insert when squeezed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a>.

### Specialized Electrode Shapes
Custom electrodes are made as needed to access confined spaces (e.g., deep inside a box) or navigate around complex shapes and folds in the metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:25:00">[25:25:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   Bent electrodes for reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:29:00">[25:29:00]</a>.
*   Thin electrodes for small areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:14:00">[26:14:00]</a>.
*   Offset electrodes for navigating around folds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:18:00">[26:18:00]</a>.
*   Electrodes to weld blades (e.g., bandsaw blades) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:00">[26:33:00]</a>.
*   Angle-cut electrodes to weld studs at precise angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>.

### Preventing Marks on One Side
To prevent marking on one side of a part, use an electrode with a much larger contact area on the side that should remain unmarked. This larger area dissipates heat, preventing it from getting hot enough to mark the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:28:00">[27:28:00]</a>. For example, when welding a stud, a V-shaped electrode can ensure no marking on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:44:00">[27:44:00]</a>.

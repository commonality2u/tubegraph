When working with adhesives, particularly in applications requiring [[precision_and_adjustability_in_mechanical_components | precision]], temperature changes can introduce significant challenges due to the differing thermal expansion coefficients of materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

## Thermal Expansion of Polymers vs. Metals

Adhesives, which are primarily polymers, have temperature expansion coefficients that are roughly an order of magnitude greater than those of metals, unless the polymers are heavily filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. This means the adhesive bond layer will expand and contract much faster than the metal it's bonding to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. This characteristic is similar to [[challenges_with_plastic_materials_in_prototyping | challenges with plastic materials]] due to their polymer nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

## Impact on Precision Components

This differential expansion poses a problem when precision needs to be maintained with temperature variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. For example, when bonding a mirror to a piece of metal using [[pros_and_cons_of_different_types_of_adhesives | epoxy]] or RTV, two main concerns arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>:
*   **Material Mismatch** The glass of the mirror and the metal have different expansion coefficients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.
*   **Adhesive Layer Expansion** The adhesive bonding layer itself expands approximately ten times faster than the metal it connects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.

If a mirror is bonded such that it acts as a head-on or 45-degree mirror, a parallel shift of the mirror due to adhesive expansion might not be a major issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. For instance, a 50-micron bond layer changing 10% in thickness would only result in a 5-micron parallel shift, which is often acceptable for lenses or mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

## Wedge Effect and Angular Changes

A more significant issue arises if the adhesive is applied as a wedge, such as when aligning a component and then filling behind it with epoxy to fix its position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. In this scenario, the angle of the mirror or component will change with temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. This creates a large multiplier effect due to the optical lever, severely impacting precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

This principle applies not only to mirrors but to any bonded structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. If a right-angle bracket is bonded parallel, it may shift up or down by a few microns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. However, if it's bonded with a wedge of adhesive, it will tilt, and the error will be magnified by the length of the structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. Therefore, careful consideration of adhesive application and joint design is crucial to avoid unwanted angular changes with temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. This is particularly important when considering [[designing_adhesive_joints_for_shear_mode_over_peel_mode | how adhesive joints are designed]], as an undesirable peel force could be induced by thermal expansion if the joint is not optimized.

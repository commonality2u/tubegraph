## Achieving Zero Wear in Moving Parts
When moving parts slide against each other, if they are only machined, they will quickly wear out and develop play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This is because machined surfaces, even finely finished ones, only touch at a few high spots when mated with another part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. These high spots bear the entire load and quickly wear off, causing the assembly to lose accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

To prevent wear, a surface must achieve full bearing, meaning it touches uniformly across its entire area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. If a surface is perfectly flat and lubricated, it will act hydrodynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. An oil film will form, preventing metal-to-metal contact, which results in virtually zero wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Achieving Flatness for Hydrodynamic Conditions
Achieving a truly flat surface is crucial for hydrodynamic lubrication. This can be done by [[lapping_and_scraping_techniques | lapping or scraping]] the part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. While grinding improves accuracy over basic machining, it is still not accurate enough to achieve full bearing; only [[lapping_and_scraping_techniques | lapping or scraping]] can achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Principles of Hydrodynamic Lubrication
The significance of a full bearing surface is three-fold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>:
1.  **Accuracy:** The part sits accurately without wobble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
2.  **Stiffness:** It can bear heavy loads with much higher stiffness as the load is distributed over the whole area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
3.  **Zero Wear:** If lubricated, it will not wear because two perfect planes with lubricant will become hydrodynamic very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. The oil film separates the surfaces, leading to zero wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

### Demonstrations and Applications
*   **Hard Drive Spindles:** Modern hard drive spindles, and even computer fans, utilize hydrodynamic sleeve bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. When spun, these bearings lose all electrical contact between the case and the spindle, indicating no metal-to-metal contact and thus no wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. A properly designed spindle can run indefinitely without wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   **Granite Square on a Granite Table:** A very flat granite square placed on a very flat granite table tends to stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. However, with a slight movement, it can quickly become hydrodynamic, floating frictionlessly on a thin film of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. This demonstrates how [[selfacting_air_bearings | selfacting air bearings]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. Air has very low viscosity, but because the load is distributed over a very large, perfect area, the pressure per unit area is very small, allowing hydrodynamic conditions to be achieved at very low speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

Hydrodynamic lift is a function of viscosity, force, and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. If the surface is not perfect, the load rests on a few points, creating high pressure and requiring a much higher velocity to achieve hydrodynamic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

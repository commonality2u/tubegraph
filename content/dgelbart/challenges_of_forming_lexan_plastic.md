Lexan, a brand of [[properties_and_uses_of_polycarbonate_in_engineering | polycarbonate]], presents specific difficulties when used in various forming processes, particularly [[vacuum_forming_with_plastics | vacuum forming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Vacuum Forming Challenges

Using Lexan for [[vacuum_forming_with_plastics | vacuum forming]] is considered very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The primary reasons for these [[challenges_of_using_plastics_in_prototyping | challenges]] include:
*   **Resistance to Softening** It does not soften easily when heated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, making it challenging to achieve the desired pliable state for molding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   **Rapid Hardening** As soon as Lexan cools even slightly, it becomes hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This rapid hardening prevents the [[plastic | material]] from pulling down all the way into the mold during the vacuum forming process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. In contrast, other [[plastic | plastics]] like PVC, ABS, and polyethylene form beautifully and pull down completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Distortion Resistance** Unlike normal [[choosing_and_using_plastics_in_prototyping | plastics]] that stay soft for a long time and can distort if removed from the mold too early, Lexan is already hard even when very hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## Properties of Lexan

Despite its [[challenges_of_using_plastics_in_prototyping | challenges]] in forming, Lexan possesses advantageous [[properties_and_uses_of_polycarbonate_in_engineering | properties]] that make it desirable for certain applications:
*   **Strength** Lexan is inherently strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
*   **Shatterproof** It is highly resistant to shattering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

> [!INFO]
> While Lexan presents specific difficulties due to its hardness and rapid cooling, these very [[properties_and_uses_of_polycarbonate_in_engineering | properties]] also contribute to its utility in applications requiring high strength and durability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

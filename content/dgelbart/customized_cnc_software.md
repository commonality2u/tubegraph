The high-precision lathe and grinder discussed in this article utilizes a [[high_precision_cnc_lathe_and_grinder | full CNC machine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The CNC software for this machine was developed by engineer James Midley from Vancouver, BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Reasons for Customization

A standard software package could not be used for this machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The primary reasons for needing a customized CNC package include:
*   The machine functions as both a lathe and a grinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   It incorporates other special features that require specific software capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Features and Operation

While the machine is [[high_accuracy_in_machining | fully CNC]], it also includes a manual mode with digital readouts, allowing operation even if issues arise with the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. The software allows for programmed operations such as cutting threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a> and multipass grinding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

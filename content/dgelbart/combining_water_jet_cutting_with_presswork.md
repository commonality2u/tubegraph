While not every small shop has a press, if one is available, it can be combined effectively with a [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]] for many useful applications [00:00:13]. This combination is particularly valuable for creating custom tooling quickly [00:04:26].

## Safety Precautions with Presses

Presses are among the most dangerous machines in a shop due to their deceiving looks [00:00:28].
> [!caution] Stored Energy and Shattering
> When a piece of steel is compressed, it stores a significant amount of energy [00:00:37]. If the material is brittle, it can suddenly shatter, releasing all this energy at once [00:00:43]. A block of steel compressed near its strength limit can store more energy than a bent truck spring [00:01:05]. If a 100-ton press shatters a steel piece of the same weight, the energy released can be much more than a rifle cartridge, capable of instantly killing a person [00:01:20]. Due to Poisson's ratio, forces are not just vertical but also sideways, causing pieces to fly like shrapnel in all directions [00:01:36].
>
> *   **Never press a hardened or brittle piece** as it will store energy and, if shattered, can explode like a hand grenade [00:01:48].
> *   Even when pressing ductile materials, tooling might be hardened, posing a risk [00:02:04]. The press itself is hardened [00:02:12].
> *   If in doubt, use a shield made of half-inch polycarbonate, which is shatterproof [00:02:15]. Anything other than pressing sheet metal should ideally be done with a shield in place [00:02:28].

> [!caution] Concentrated Force and Press Damage
> Applying the full force of a press onto a very small area, like a dime or even an aluminum washer, can damage the press [00:02:37]. For example, 100 tons concentrated on 2 square centimeters exceeds the yield strength of the best steel (50 tons per square centimeter vs. 10-20 tons per square centimeter yield strength) [00:02:55]. This can dent or even crack the press [00:03:09].
>
> *   A press should not be loaded with more than approximately 10 tons per square centimeter [00:03:26].
> *   Avoid pressing items with an area less than 10 square centimeters to prevent accidental damage to the press [00:03:34].
> *   Even small pieces of plastic or wood can damage the press if the full force is applied [00:03:46].

## Enhancing Structures with Presswork

A press, when combined with a [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]], becomes highly versatile for shaping materials [00:04:21].

### Custom Tooling for Presses
The [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]] allows for the rapid creation of tooling for a press [00:04:26]. Special shapes can be cut from mild steel plates in minutes, ready to be used in the press to form sheet metal [00:04:30]. This is significantly faster than milling out patterns on a [[cnc_plasma_cutter_as_an_alternative | CNC mill]], especially concerning clamping and setup [00:07:37].

### Creating Lightweight, High-Performance Structures
Presswork is crucial for fabricating high-performance, lightweight structures, particularly those requiring stiffness, such as airborne components [00:04:41].
*   **Closed-Form Pieces**: Stiffness in lightweight structures is best achieved using closed-form pieces, similar to how car bodies gain rigidity [00:04:52].
*   **Adding Ribs**: A flat metal strip has little rigidity [00:05:10]. Pressing in a rib significantly increases the moment of inertia and strength [00:05:26]. For torsional strength, a closed shape is necessary [00:05:42]. Pressing in two ribs and then spot-welding them around the edges creates a piece with the same weight but improved bending and torsional stiffness [00:05:47].
*   **Materials**: Mild steel or stainless steel can be used [00:06:15]. For very high-performance structures, certain stainless steels (e.g., 17/7 stainless) that can be heat-treated after forming are ideal [00:06:19]. These can be pressed into the desired shape, spot-welded, and then heat-treated in an oven to achieve a high elastic range, allowing them to spring back if bent [00:06:26].
*   **Example: Lightweight Box Reinforcement**: For a lightweight box cover needing reinforcement, two layers are cut on the [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]] (one with tabs, one as a backing) [00:07:16]. These are spot-welded together, then a piece of metal is placed over them and pressed to create the desired shape [00:07:27].

### Forming Cylindrical Components
Presses are also essential for creating cylindrical boxes, particularly for forming the lips on round covers [00:07:57].
*   **Tooling**: [[Waterjet cutter usage and benefits | Water jet]] can cut both male and female tooling simultaneously for these parts [00:08:20].
*   **Clearance**: When cutting tooling, ensure sufficient clearance; for 1mm thick material, about 1.5-2mm clearance around the tool is needed to prevent jamming [00:08:30].
*   After pressing, the ugly edges can be sanded to achieve a clean disc [00:08:49].

## Pressing Techniques and Alignment

### Aligning Male and Female Tools
A key challenge when pressing with male and female dies is alignment, especially with sheet metal in between [00:09:00].
*   **Initial Rough Press**: One method to overcome this is to first press the material using only the male tool against a backing material like hard rubber or polyurethane [00:09:36]. This creates a rough shape that then serves to register (align) the male and female halves for a second, more precise press [00:11:34].
    *   Pressing against rubber provides a nice rib but lacks sharp definition [00:11:10]. The rubber must be larger than the metal piece to prevent wrinkling at the edges [00:11:22].
*   **Precise Pressing**: Once the rough shape is established, the material can be placed on the female die, and the male die, which sits inside the formed groove, ensures accurate alignment [00:11:48]. This second press with male and female dies produces much sharper lines [00:13:08].

### Deep Drawing and Annealing
For deep-drawn shapes, the material may need to be annealed (heated red hot and allowed to cool) to prevent tearing [00:13:13].
*   Complex shapes may require multiple draws; for instance, an initial draw with a shallower die (e.g., 0.5-inch thick) followed by annealing, and then a deeper draw with the final die (e.g., 1-inch thick) [00:13:24]. This process mirrors techniques in the stamping industry where annealing between steps improves ductility [00:13:46].

### Pressing into Lead
For sharp detail in a single pressing step, the material can be pressed into a sheet of lead, which can be reused by melting it down [00:14:17].
*   **Shearing vs. Pressing**: Be cautious with steel tooling that has sharp corners, as it may shear the material rather than just pressing it, as there is little difference between a shear and a press [00:14:34]. If the corners are too sharp, the tool can act like a punch, effectively punching out the part [00:14:49]. Tools designed for pressing typically have rounded edges [00:16:00].

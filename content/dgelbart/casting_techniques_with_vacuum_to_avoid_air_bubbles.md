The replication of parts, especially those with intricate shapes or requiring specific material properties not achievable with 3D printers, often utilizes molding and casting processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28">[02:28]</a>. Achieving high-quality casts, particularly those free of air bubbles, can be accomplished using vacuum techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07">[06:07]</a>.

## [[silicone_rubber_mold_making | Silicone Rubber Mold Making]]

To replicate a part, a mold is typically created from [[silicone_rubber_mold_making | silicone rubber]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52">[02:52]</a>. This specific type of [[silicone_rubber_mold_making | silicone rubber mold making]] material does not adhere to anything, eliminating the need for mold release agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24">[03:24]</a>. The object to be copied is placed in a small box and covered with the two-component [[silicone_rubber_mold_making | silicone rubber]] mixture, which is then cured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13">[03:13]</a>.

[[silicone_rubber_mold_making | Silicone rubber]] molds are flexible, allowing for easy removal of parts, even those with undercuts, pins, or internal features like hex holes for set screws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52">[03:52]</a>. The copying ability of this process extends to a molecular level, precisely replicating surface textures and fine details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21">[04:21]</a>. While excellent for surface texture, the dimensional accuracy might be less precise due to the mold's flexibility, though a metal screen can be embedded within the [[silicone_rubber_mold_making | rubber]] for greater rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04">[05:04]</a>.

## Degassing Viscous Materials

When mixing viscous materials like epoxies or silicones, air bubbles often become trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22">[05:22]</a>. To eliminate these, the mixed material must be degassed in a vacuum chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27">[05:27]</a>. The material should be placed in a container significantly taller (e.g., four times taller) than the mixed volume, as it will foam up during degassing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46">[05:46]</a>. A half-hour under vacuum is typically sufficient for all air bubbles to explode and dissipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37">[05:37]</a>.

## Vacuum Casting Process

For casting high-quality copies without air bubbles or defects, the process is ideally performed under vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05">[06:05]</a>.

### Degassing the Resin

Before casting, the resin (e.g., polyester, epoxy, polyurethane) should also be degassed to ensure no trapped air bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32">[06:32]</a>. Similar to silicone, the resin should occupy less than a third of the container's height to allow for expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39">[06:39]</a>. It is left under vacuum until bubbles collapse, typically around half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01">[07:01]</a>.

### Filling the Mold under Vacuum

1.  Place the degassed mold inside a vacuum chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17">[06:17]</a>.
2.  Insert one end of a feed tube into the degassed resin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23">[07:23]</a>.
3.  Place the other end of the feed tube into the mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39">[07:39]</a>. A guard around the mold is advisable to contain any overflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48">[07:48]</a>.
4.  Initiate the vacuum; the vacuum pressure will draw the resin into the mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05">[08:05]</a>.
5.  Once the mold is full, pinch off the feed tube to prevent further resin flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23">[08:23]</a>.

### Releasing Vacuum for Bubble Collapse

After filling the mold, release the vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29">[08:29]</a>. This step is crucial because even if the material was degassed, tiny air bubbles might have been introduced during the filling process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45">[08:45]</a>. As the vacuum is released, these bubbles collapse and disappear because they contain very little air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57">[08:57]</a>. Any foam formed will also collapse and vanish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08">[09:08]</a>.

### Curing the Part

After filling and releasing the vacuum, remove the feed tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13">[09:13]</a>. The part is then cured by heating it to a specific temperature, typically between 50°C to 80°C, depending on the resin type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15">[09:15]</a>. For silicone molds, curing may occur around 100°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24">[09:24]</a>. Pigments can be added to the resin to achieve desired colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39">[09:39]</a>.

## Properties of Vacuum-Casted Parts

The resulting cast parts typically exhibit a high level of detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53">[09:53]</a>. While the surface gloss might sometimes be lower than the original, it largely depends on the specific resin used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55">[09:55]</a>.

## Advanced Applications

*   **Two-Part Molds:** For objects with features on multiple sides, two-part molds can be created by pouring a second layer of silicone over the first half, incorporating registration pins for alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09">[10:09]</a>. These molds would then have a feed hole and air escape holes for filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29">[10:29]</a>.
*   **Inserts and Fillers:** Metal inserts can be placed into the mold for features like threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48">[10:48]</a>. Fillers, such as finely chopped carbon fiber, can be mixed into the resin or laid into the mold and then impregnated with resin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52">[10:52]</a>.
*   **Impregnation:** This vacuum process is ideal for impregnating electrical coils or other items that require waterproofing and durability, as it ensures resin fills all voids where air would typically be trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01">[11:01]</a>.
*   **[[use_of_different_materials_for_castinglike_assemblies | Molten Metal]] Casting:** [[silicone_rubber_mold_making | Silicone]] has a high short-term temperature resistance, especially red silicone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17">[11:17]</a>. This allows for casting [[use_of_different_materials_for_castinglike_assemblies | molten metal]] parts, such as zinc alloy, directly into the silicone mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26">[11:26]</a>. Some [[use_of_different_materials_for_castinglike_assemblies | aluminum alloys]] can also be poured, though this may degrade the mold more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35">[11:35]</a>. While a silicone mold can produce hundreds of plastic parts, it might yield around ten metal parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40">[11:40]</a>. A common zinc-aluminum alloy used for die casting can produce perfect parts when cast in silicone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46">[11:46]</a>.

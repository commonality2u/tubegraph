Creating parts that are both airtight and frictionless is possible through extremely high precision machining, enabling components to operate without traditional [[The Role of Lubrication in Reducing Wear in High Accuracy Parts | lubrication]] and resist wear.

## Precision Machining Capability
A scratch-built, high-precision lathe and grinder is capable of cutting, turning, and grinding parts to a tolerance of one micron, or 40 millionths of an inch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This level of [[Techniques for Measuring and Ensuring Precision in Mechanical Parts | accuracy]] is crucial for producing airtight and frictionless components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Demonstration: Cylinder and Piston
An example of parts made with this machine is a cylinder and piston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The piston is a complete sliding fit within the cylinder, initially appearing to be a loose fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Airtight Property
When the air vent on top of the cylinder is sealed, the piston becomes completely airtight within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Frictionless Property
Due to the high [[Techniques for Measuring and Ensuring Precision in Mechanical Parts | accuracy]] of the parts, if spun, the piston spins freely as if it were on ball bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It functions like a self-acting air bearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Similarly, spinning the inner piece results in it spinning frictionlessly for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Benefits of Such Parts
A bearing made with this precision would never need [[The Role of Lubrication in Reducing Wear in High Accuracy Parts | lubrication]] and would never wear out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This is because there is no physical contact between the inner and outer parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, which can be verified with an ohmmeter while the parts turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This concept is similar to air bearings found in hard drives or other self-acting air bearing devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Achieving such parts without this type of precision machine would typically require time-consuming lapping processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. With the precision machine, parts emerge with the required fit directly from the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

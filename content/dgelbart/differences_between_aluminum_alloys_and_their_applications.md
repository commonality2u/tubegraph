Aluminum is a versatile metal useful for various applications. It serves as a good general-purpose material for heat sinks, although copper is superior for this purpose but more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Aluminum is also suitable for constructing large structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Recommended Aluminum Alloys

When stocking aluminum, especially in sheet form, specific alloys are preferred due to their distinct [[properties_and_uses_of_different_metals_particularly_stainless_steel | properties and uses]].

*   **5052 Aluminum Alloy**
    *   **Advantage:** This alloy can be bent without cracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
    *   **Application:** It is recommended for heat sinks, particularly those that need to be bent to increase surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   **Stocking:** If only one size were to be stocked, a gauge 10 or 12 in 5052 alloy is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   **Note:** Thin aluminum sheets are not considered very useful outside of heat sink applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

*   **6061 Aluminum Alloy**
    *   **Disadvantage:** This is a more popular alloy, but it tends to crack when bent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. A demonstration shows it cracking at the bend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## Machining Aluminum

When machining aluminum, applying wax to the cutting tool prevents the aluminum from sticking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. This technique even allows for machining aluminum with woodworking tools:
*   **Table Saw:** Waxing the blade enables cutting aluminum plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
*   **Router:** Waxing the blade or the workpiece allows for routing aluminum sheets with a standard router <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

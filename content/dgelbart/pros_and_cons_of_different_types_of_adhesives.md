When building structures or bonding components, selecting the appropriate adhesive is crucial. Different types of adhesives offer unique properties, advantages, and disadvantages that dictate their suitability for various applications. Generally, there are about four main types of adhesives commonly used in a lab environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

## Epoxy

Epoxy, particularly 5-minute epoxy, is a commonly used adhesive due to its relatively quick setting time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. While it's called "5-minute epoxy," it requires about an hour to achieve reasonable strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Advantages
*   **Strength in Shear Mode**: Epoxy performs exceptionally well in [[designing_adhesive_joints_for_shear_mode_over_peel_mode | shear mode joints]], where the load is distributed evenly across the entire bonded area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. A properly designed epoxy shear joint can withstand significant forces, such as two tons for a 1/10th scale model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   **Adjustable Working Time**: The working time of fast epoxy can be extended by mixing it on a chilled piece of metal, like aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Temporary Structures**: Epoxy bonds can be released by heating the structure to approximately 150째C (300째F) in an oven or with a torch, making it suitable for [[techniques_for_building_temporary_and_rigid_structures_with_adhesive_bonding | temporary setups]] where disassembly is desired later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Disadvantages
*   **Poor Peel Strength**: Epoxy has virtually zero strength in [[designing_adhesive_joints_for_shear_mode_over_peel_mode | peel mode]] because the stress is concentrated along a single line, causing the bond to fail instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. Many joints, even those not intuitively thought of as peel mode, can fail this way (e.g., a simple bracket loaded in bending) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Rigidity**: Epoxy is a rigid adhesive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>, which can be a disadvantage when bonding to slightly flexible materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.
*   **Surface Preparation**: Like most adhesives, epoxy requires proper surface preparation, such as sandblasting or bluing, to achieve a strong bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

## Silicone RTV (Room Temperature Vulcanizing)

Silicone RTV is a versatile adhesive with unique properties that set it apart from others.

### Advantages
*   **High Temperature Resistance**: RTV is one of the few common adhesives that can withstand high temperatures. Clear RTV can endure up to 250째C, while red (iron-cure) RTV can tolerate around 300째C or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. This makes it ideal for applications involving heaters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.
*   **Elasticity**: RTV remains elastic indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, allowing it to distribute stress over a larger area in flexible or [[designing_adhesive_joints_for_shear_mode_over_peel_mode | peel mode]] situations, unlike rigid epoxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.
*   **Bonding to Glass/Ceramics**: RTV forms a tenacious chemical bond to glass and certain ceramics without the need for extensive surface preparation like sandblasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. This property is evident in the construction of aquariums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

## Polyurethane

Polyurethane adhesives offer flexibility and good gap-filling capabilities.

### Advantages
*   **Flexibility**: Polyurethane is somewhat flexible and forms a tenacious bond to flexible materials like rubber, where rigid adhesives struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   **Gap Filling**: Certain types of polyurethane are designed to foam up and fill gaps on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   **Good Peel Strength**: Polyurethane adhesives, being semiflexible, exhibit better [[designing_adhesive_joints_for_shear_mode_over_peel_mode | peel strength]] compared to epoxy because they can stretch and distribute stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.
*   **Bonding Sheets**: It is excellent for bonding sheets together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

### Disadvantages
*   **Cure Time**: Polyurethane adhesives typically require overnight curing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

## Contact Cement

Contact cement is useful for covering large surfaces uniformly.

### Advantages
*   **Uniform Application**: It allows for uniform adhesive application over large areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

### Disadvantages
*   **Application Method**: Unlike most other adhesives, contact cement must be sprayed onto both surfaces to be bonded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>.

## Cyanoacrylates (Super Glue)

Cyanoacrylates, commonly known as super glue or magic glue, are fast-acting adhesives but have several significant drawbacks, especially for scientific or precision work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

### Advantages
*   **Fast Bonding to Rubber**: They are very good for bonding rubber instantly, such as for O-rings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

### Disadvantages
*   **Rigidity and Brittleness**: Super glues are very rigid, making joints susceptible to breaking under shock loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.
*   **Outgassing**: A major issue with cyanoacrylates is that they slowly emit gas over time. If used in a sealed box with optics, the optics can fog up within weeks, rendering them unusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. While other adhesives also outgas, their outgassing can be largely stopped by baking, which is not as effective for super glues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
*   **Material Degradation**: They can cause certain plastics to "craze," developing micro-cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. This can lead to cracked plastic pieces over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.
*   **Not Recommended for Scientific Work**: Due to outgassing and material degradation, super glues are generally not recommended for precise scientific work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

## General Considerations for All Adhesives

*   **Surface Preparation**: For most adhesives, proper [[preparing_surfaces_for_adhesive_bonding | surface preparation]] is essential. This can involve cleaning, bluing, or preferably, sandblasting to create a good bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Thermal Expansion**: Adhesives, being polymers, have thermal expansion coefficients roughly an order of magnitude higher than metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. When bonding items requiring precision with temperature changes, such as optics to metal, this can be a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. If the adhesive forms a wedge, even a small thickness change can lead to a significant tilt, magnified by optical levers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. This concern is part of [[challenges_with_adhesives_in_maintaining_precision_with_temperature_changes | challenges with adhesives in maintaining precision with temperature changes]].

When designing with adhesives, always prioritize [[designing_adhesive_joints_for_shear_mode_over_peel_mode | shear mode over peel mode]] for maximum strength and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

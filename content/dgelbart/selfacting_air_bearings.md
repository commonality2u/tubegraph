From: [[dgelbart]] <br/> 

Self-acting air bearings are mechanical components designed to allow parts to spin or move frictionlessly without physical contact between surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This lack of contact is a key characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a> and can be verified with an Ohm meter while the components are turning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

### Properties and Benefits
The primary advantages of self-acting air bearings are:
*   **No Lubrication Required:** A bearing made this way will never need [[hydrodynamic_lubrication | lubrication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.
*   **No Wear:** Due to the absence of contact between the inner and outer parts, the bearing will never wear out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

This concept is similar to air bearings found in hard drives or other self-acting air bearing devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

### Application Example: Cylinder and Piston
An example of parts exhibiting self-acting air bearing properties is a cylinder and piston made on a high-precision lathe capable of [[achieving_one_micron_accuracy | one micron accuracy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
*   The piston has a complete sliding fit within the cylinder, initially appearing loose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.
*   When the air vent is sealed, it becomes completely airtight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
*   Because of its accuracy, if spun, it rotates freely as if on ball bearings, acting like a self-acting air bearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. The inner piece will spin frictionlessly for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   Producing such parts without this precision machine would require time-consuming lapping to achieve the required fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

### Use in Machine Components
The high-precision lathe itself incorporates self-acting air bearings in several of its [[unique_machine_components_and_design | components]]:
*   **Tail Stock:** The tail stock floats on air bearings and has a very long travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
*   **Saddle:** The entire saddle floats on air bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   **Cross-slide:** The cross-slide also floats on air bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   **Main Spindle:** The main spindle is mounted on air bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **Grinding Spindle:** The grinding spindle is also mounted on air bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

The air bearings for the main spindle and grinding spindle were acquired as surplus semiconductor machinery units, which are often air bearing-based and can be bought economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

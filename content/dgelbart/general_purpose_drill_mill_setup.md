A general purpose drill mill is a simple machine convenient for various tasks [00:00:14]. Proper setup and certain modifications can significantly enhance its efficiency and precision.

## Vice Setup
It is convenient to set up a drill mill with both a milling vice and a drilling vice simultaneously [00:00:17].
*   The drilling vice is quick-acting, saving time for drilling operations [00:00:25]. However, it is not rigid enough for milling and will loosen [00:00:31].
*   A separate, stiffer vice is required for [[efficient_milling_strategies_and_tool_selection | milling]] operations [00:00:35]. Most drill mills offer enough space to accommodate both vices [00:00:36].

## Recommended [[modifications_for_milling_machines | Modifications for Milling Machines]] and Enhancements

Several enhancements can improve the functionality of a general purpose drill mill:

### Depth Adjustment Nut
Standard depth adjustment nuts on these machines can be slow to turn [00:01:00]. A worthwhile [[modifications_for_milling_machines | modification]] is to drill a hole through the nut at a slight angle [00:01:06]. This allows the nut to be turned easily for fine adjustments, or tilted and slid for larger, quicker movements, saving significant time [00:01:12].

### Variable Frequency Drive (VFD)
For machines with a belt drive unit and step pulley system, installing a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) is a must [00:01:26]. A VFD, also known as a variable speed drive, is a simple and inexpensive upgrade [00:01:37]. It allows for a very wide range of speed adjustments without needing to manually change belts on pulleys [00:01:50]. This is particularly useful for tasks like tapping, where precise speed control is essential [00:02:00].

### Digital Readout (DRO)
A digital readout is a standard and very useful accessory for a drill mill, providing precise positional feedback [00:02:06].

### DIY Laser Center Finder
An accessory that is unfortunately not commercially available but highly useful is a laser center finder [00:02:12]. This can be constructed from a laser pointer head (with its lens slightly moved for proper focus), a battery, and a custom housing designed to clip onto the chuck or collet shank [00:02:20].

This device projects a circle of light, with the center of the circle indicating the exact axis of the spindle [00:02:46]. It offers several benefits for [[techniques_for_precise_hole_drilling_and_reaming | precise hole drilling]]:
*   **Lining up with a Mark:** Makes it very easy to align the machine spindle with a marked point on a workpiece [00:02:51].
*   **Finding Center:** By making the light spot larger, one can easily find the center of a feature [00:03:09].
*   **Aligning with Existing Features:**
    *   **Holes or Pins:** It is particularly useful for lining up with an existing hole or pin [00:03:20]. By observing the ring of light, adjustments can be made until the ring is horizontal, indicating perfect centering to the hole [00:04:17].
    *   **Cross Drilling:** For cross-drilling, the light is adjusted until it is broken at both ends simultaneously, forming a "V" shape on both sides, which indicates centering to the diameter [00:04:35].
This simple device provides about 50-micron accuracy with ease [00:04:55].

### Collet Standardization
To save time and streamline tool changes, it is desirable to standardize on one collet size for all tooling [00:05:13]. For example, standardizing on a 3/4-inch collet allows all accessories like chucks, boring bars, and even some milling cutters to use the same shank size [00:05:21]. This enables instant switching between [[efficient_milling_strategies_and_tool_selection | milling]], [[basics_of_drilling_and_center_punching | drilling]], and boring operations without changing collets [00:05:43].

### Keyless Chucks
When selecting a chuck, a keyless chuck is preferable over a traditional key chuck [00:06:12].
*   **Advantages:** Keyless chucks eliminate the need to search for a key [00:06:21]. They are generally more accurate and are self-tightening, meaning they will tighten themselves further during [[basics_of_drilling_and_center_punching | drilling]] operations [00:06:24].
*   **Disadvantage:** A keyless chuck is also self-opening when run in reverse [00:06:48]. If performing a tapping operation that requires reversing the tap, it must be tightened very hard to prevent it from opening [00:06:55].

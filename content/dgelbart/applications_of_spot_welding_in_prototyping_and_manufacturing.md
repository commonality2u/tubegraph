A spot welder is a machine used to join metal pieces, particularly effective for sheet metal. While designs may vary, their core function remains consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Basic Operation and Safety

### Setting Up the Welder
To weld sheet metal, the primary setting to adjust is the **time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Some machines also have a pressure setting, which should generally be set to maximum and left there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The time setting must be carefully calibrated based on the metal's thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Determining the Correct Setting
A **tear test** is performed to find the optimal time setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>:
1.  Take two pieces of metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
2.  Make several welds at different time settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
3.  Attempt to tear the welded pieces apart. The correct setting is when the metal itself tears, rather than the weld opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
After some experience, one can often visually determine the correct setting or refer to charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. It's recommended to create two charts: one for stainless steel and one for mild steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Safety Precautions
*   **Eye Protection**: Always wear goggles, or glasses are often sufficient, as the process sparks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Foot Protection**: Avoid wearing sandals, as molten metal can drip and cause burns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Electrical Safety**: While the voltage is low (around 2.5 volts), currents can be extremely high (5,000 amps), generating significant magnetic forces that can attract metallic objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.

### Current vs. Time Adjustment
When a spot welder offers both adjustable current and time, it is always recommended to set the current to maximum and adjust only the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Higher current with shorter times minimizes heat escape sideways, leading to more efficient welds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This principle is why [[the_role_of_laser_welding_in_brazing_preparation | laser welding]] produces beautiful welds due to its super short times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Applications in Prototyping and Manufacturing

### Prototyping Flexibility
Spot welders are highly convenient for [[prototyping_using_water_jet_cutting | prototyping]] due to their ability to create both temporary and permanent welds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Temporary Welds**: By using a lower time setting, a very weak weld can be made that can be easily broken off by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This is useful for positioning components temporarily, akin to using temporary glue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Permanent Welds**: Once a part is accurately positioned, the time setting can be increased to create a strong, permanent weld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Removing Permanent Welds**: If a permanent weld needs to be undone, the only effective method is to drill it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The weld spot creates a natural center mark for drilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Material Compatibility
Spot welders are primarily effective with ferrous metals like mild steel and stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. They can also weld exotic metals such as tungsten and titanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. However, they cannot weld non-ferrous metals like copper, as these materials conduct electricity too well, causing the electrodes themselves to weld together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Welding Thick Materials
A 15 KVA unit, which is typically the minimum recommended power, can weld sheet metal up to about 3mm to 3mm (gauge 12 to gauge 12, or gauge 10 to gauge 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. For stainless steel, it might handle slightly heavier gauges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Spot welding is not designed for very thick materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Fortunately, where spot welding's capability ends, TIG welding becomes easier even for inexperienced users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Welding Rods and Wires
Spot welders are highly efficient at [[welding_techniques_for_rods_and_various_hardware | welding rods]] and wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Even a 15 KVA unit can easily weld 3/8-inch rod and even 1/2-inch rod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This efficiency is due to the small contact area between rods, leading to very high current density, and heat escape in only one direction along the rod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The tear test for rods involves twisting them to ensure the rod shears before the weld breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Welding Captive Hardware
Spot welders are extremely useful for attaching various types of captive hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>:
*   **Studs**: Special hollow electrodes are needed to hold the screw, with an M4 size fitting in this setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Standoffs often have a ball and spring mechanism to hold the hardware in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Studs usually have a small point (pip) at the end, allowing for accurate placement by feeling for it to lock into a pre-made mark (e.g., from a [[prototyping_using_water_jet_cutting | water jet cutter]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Standard round-head screws (Allen, slot, Phillips) can also be used as studs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Nuts**: Spot welding nuts have three projections and a pilot shoulder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. A hole is cut for the pilot, ensuring accuracy, and then the nut is spot welded between two flat electrodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. The larger the contact area, the higher the weld setting needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Sometimes, threads may need to be cleaned with a tap after welding due to ejected metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Alternatively, a plain piece of thicker metal or a washer can be welded to the back of thin sheet metal to create enough thickness for tapping a thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Thread inserts resembling pop rivets are another option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Standoffs**: Threaded standoffs are welded similarly to studs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Hinges**: Hinges can be purchased in long strips and easily spot welded onto covers or boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   **Latches and Closures**: A wide range of spot weldable hardware exists for various uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Welding Balls
Welding balls is a useful application for creating kinematic mounts, bars with balls at the end, or couplings and adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Custom electrodes with conical holes are used to hold the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Balls are cheap and accurate, making them advantageous for various adjustments, such as creating a rod that can move and lock in any direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. The conical adapter, despite touching the ball, does not leave marks if there's sufficient contact area between the copper electrode and the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

### Creating Invisible Welds
To achieve an "invisible weld" where no mark is visible on the outside, standard flat electrodes are insufficient as the molten metal pulls inward upon solidification, leaving a dimple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. A special electrode with a small dimple (few millimeters in diameter, 50 microns deep) at the weld point is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. This dimple pushes the metal outwards by the exact amount it shrinks when cooling, resulting in a perfectly flat surface that only requires minimal sanding to remove any slight bump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. This is crucial for aesthetic reasons or for cleanliness in applications like medical devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

### Welding Non-Weldable Materials
When a material like Nitinol (often used in medical devices) or phosphor bronze/beryllium copper (useful but non-ferrous) cannot be brazed, soldered, or welded directly, it can be spot welded by trapping it between two pieces of weldable material, typically stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. The weld passes through the non-weldable material, joining everything together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. For example, a Nitinol wire can be slid into a stainless steel hypodermic tubing and then welded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. Bending the ends of the non-weldable material to create a gradual radius prevents abrupt, weak transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

### Creating Watertight Enclosures
Spot welding can create watertight enclosures by applying a very thin bead of RTV silicone between the parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. The pressure from the weld displaces the silicone, allowing the weld to form through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>. This method, done with a dense pitch of welds, results in a completely watertight seal, useful for gas tanks or similar containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.

### Salvaging Material for Water Jet Cutting
Spot welding can be used to salvage small pieces of material for [[prototyping_using_water_jet_cutting | water jet cutting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. Since a water jet's clamping area prevents cutting all the way to the edge of a small piece, a larger scrap piece can be attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. For thin materials, one piece can be spot welded on top of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. For thicker materials where a step is undesirable, the pieces can be butt-welded flush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. This "horizontal" weld is not as strong as a vertical one but provides enough hold for the water jet to grip the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

## Electrodes and Customization

### Electrode Material and Tips
Spot welder electrodes are typically made of copper, which is easy to bend and becomes work-hardened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. For long-lasting tips that resist squeezing and wear, inserts made from copper-tungsten alloy or, more commonly, copper-chrome alloy are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. These tips can be machined with a taper and pressed into a tapered hole in the copper electrode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

### Custom Electrodes
Many spot welding jobs require custom electrodes. Having a copper bar allows for the fabrication of various specialized electrodes as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
*   **Accessing Cavities**: Electrodes with long, angled, or offset necks are useful for reaching deep inside boxes or cavities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. Shorter necks generally allow for higher current by minimizing inductance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.
*   **Precision Angle Welding**: Electrodes can be cut at a precise angle to ensure that a welded rod or stud comes out at a specific desired angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
*   **Preventing Marks**: To avoid marking a part during welding, the electrode on the side that should remain unmarked needs a much larger contact area than the active welding tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. This ensures that the larger area does not heat up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.

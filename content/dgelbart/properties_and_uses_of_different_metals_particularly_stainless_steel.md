Selecting the right materials is crucial for any shop or lab, with hundreds of useful options available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A minimalistic approach focuses on key materials that cover the majority of building needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Mild Steel (Cold Rolled)

Cold-rolled mild steel sheets are a fundamental material for general fabrication due to their strength, affordability, and widespread availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It is easily [[welding_techniques_for_rods_and_various_hardware | spot welded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> and works effectively with [[designing_with_wire_and_sheet_metal | bending]] and water jet cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

For general use, recommended stock thicknesses include Gauge 18 (approximately 1.2 mm) and Gauge 10 (just over 3 mm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The heavier Gauge 10 is ideal for robust components like brackets, bases, and large assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Stainless Steel

Stainless steel is another essential material, commonly available in 300 and 400 series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The cheapest 300 series stainless steel is recommended for general stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Due to its higher cost, stocking Gauge 18 and Gauge 12 (rather than Gauge 10) is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Stainless Steel for Springs

*   **Spring Temper Stainless (300 Series):**
    *   This type, such as 301 full hard, is very convenient for making springs by simply cutting from a sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   A significant advantage of 300 series spring temper stainless is its ability to be sheared and [[designing_with_wire_and_sheet_metal | bent]] without breaking, despite its springy nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   Harder 400 series spring temper stainless exists but is more difficult to work with as it cannot be sheared or bent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   It can be purchased affordably from suppliers selling the ends of wide rolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **17-7 PH Stainless Steel:**
    *   This alloy is a heat-treatable stainless steel that comes in an annealed (very soft) state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
    *   After a specific [[the_process_and_importance_of_hardening_steels | heat treating]] cycle (typically double heating without quenching, e.g., 760°C then 580°C), it becomes exceptionally hard and springy, making it one of the strongest and springiest stainless steels available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
    *   This property allows for forming, bending, and [[welding_techniques_for_rods_and_various_hardware | spot welding]] in its malleable state before hardening the entire piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
    *   The 17-7 PH alloy is also available as spring wire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. When used as wire, it requires only one heating cycle (e.g., 480°C for 1 hour) after winding the spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Free Machining Alloys

When stocking bars and rods of both steel and stainless steel, opt for "free machining" types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. These are enhanced by adding elements like lead or sulfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. While slightly more expensive, the improved machining time and surface finish significantly outweigh the minimal extra material cost for prototyping or small batch production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Aluminum

Aluminum is a versatile metal useful for large structures and as sheets for heat sinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Although copper is superior for heat sinking, aluminum offers a good balance of performance and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

*   **5052 Alloy:** Recommended for general sheet stock (e.g., Gauge 10 or 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Its primary advantage, especially for heat sinks, is its ability to be [[designing_with_wire_and_sheet_metal | bent]] without cracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **6061 Alloy:** While more popular, it tends to crack when [[designing_with_wire_and_sheet_metal | bent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Spring Wire

Having spring wire allows for quickly manufacturing custom springs (both compression and tension) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Music Wire:** This is carbon steel, which is the cheapest option and widely available in various sizes if rust proofing is not required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **17-7 PH Stainless Steel Wire:** For corrosion resistance, this alloy is used, which becomes very strong and springy after a single [[the_process_and_importance_of_hardening_steels | heat treatment]] cycle (e.g., 480°C for 1 hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Bearing Bronze

Bronze (specifically bearing bronze) is highly recommended for parts that slide against steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. It offers significantly better performance than brass for such applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. Small amounts of bronze plates or rods can be stocked for making bushings or wear pads, which, when lubricated, provide excellent longevity against hardened steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

## Hardenable Steels

For parts requiring hardening, choosing the right steel is important.

*   **A2 Air-Hardening Steel:**
    *   The preferred hardenable steel for a general shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
    *   **Advantage 1:** It is air-hardening, meaning it hardens upon cooling in air after heating, eliminating the need for quenching, which can cause distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.
    *   **Advantage 2:** A2 is optimized for very low dimensional change after hardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. This allows parts to be machined close to their final "net shape" before hardening, minimizing post-hardening grinding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
    *   To prevent decarburization (loss of hardness on the surface) during heating in an oven, wrap the steel in paper and then seal it in stainless foil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. The paper carbonizes and absorbs oxygen, protecting the steel surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.
*   **440 Stainless Steel:**
    *   A hardenable stainless steel, often used for surgical tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
    *   It hardens similarly to A2 (heat and cool quickly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
    *   While hardenable, it is less corrosion-resistant than 300 series stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   **High-Speed Steel (HSS):**
    *   The material for most cutting tools like drills and reamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.
    *   Can be ground to make custom cutting tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
*   **Regular Carbon Steel:**
    *   The cheapest hardenable steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.
    *   Requires quenching for hardening, which demands more specialized knowledge and can lead to significant dimensional changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

### Identifying Steels by Spark Test

Steels often look identical, but a spark test using a grinder can differentiate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

*   **Mild Steel:** Produces very few sparks, with no "star" at the end of the spark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.
*   **Carbon Steel:** Produces many more sparks, with a distinct "star" at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
*   **A2 Steel:** Produces dimmer, darker sparks with no star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
*   **High-Speed Steel:** Produces very few, very dark (reddish) sparks, with almost no star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.
*   **440 Surgical Stainless Steel:** Produces almost no sparks at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. It can be difficult to distinguish from high-speed steel, but 440 generally sparks slightly less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.

### [[the_process_and_importance_of_hardening_steels | Hardening Steels]] with a Torch

Small pieces of steel can be hardened quickly using a torch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
1.  **Heat Treatment:** Place a thermal insulator (like a fire brick) behind the piece to reflect heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. Heat the A2 steel until it reaches a "white hot" temperature (around 950°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
2.  **Air Cool:** Move the piece away from the heat and allow it to cool in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>. Once cooled, the steel will be fully hard but brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.
3.  **Tempering:** To reduce brittleness and increase toughness, temper the steel by reheating it to a lower temperature, typically between 250°C and 300°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
    *   **Temperature by Color:** Steel exhibits characteristic color changes during tempering, which can be used to gauge temperature:
        *   Straw color: ~220°C (Rockwell 60C hardness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>
        *   Dark blue: ~270°C (Rockwell 56-55C hardness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>
        *   Light blue: ~300°C (provides much better toughness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>
    *   Use a small flame and continuously move it to avoid overheating one spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. Direct more heat to thicker sections of an asymmetric part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.

## Other Useful Materials

*   **Loctite:** Useful for securing tight fits, such as bearings on shafts or screws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Caution should be exercised as its vapors can cause cracking in some plastics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
*   **Wax Stick:** An inexpensive and valuable cutting lubricant, especially for machining aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. Applying wax to blades (e.g., table saw, router bits) allows for cutting and routing aluminum with woodworking tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.
*   **Carbide Inserts:** Pieces of discarded carbide inserts can be [[welding_techniques_for_rods_and_various_hardware | brazed]] to mild steel stems to create custom cutting tools or special size drills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

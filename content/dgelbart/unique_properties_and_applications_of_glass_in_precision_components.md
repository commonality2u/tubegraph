Glass possesses an unusual property that makes it invaluable for creating highly precise and intricate components, particularly in optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## Shape Retention During Drawing

A key characteristic of glass is its ability to maintain a precise shape when heated and drawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. If a prismatic shape, such as a d-shaped cross-section, is ground into glass and then heated and drawn, it will become thinner while perfectly retaining its original form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Even very sharp corners on the initial shape will be retained during the drawing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

The accuracy of this form retention is approximately one micron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Furthermore, this is a predictable process, meaning that any errors in retaining the form are repeatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. This allows for the preform to be ground with the error included, making it possible to achieve sub-micron accuracy after a single pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

It is crucial to heat the glass gently to avoid cracking and to maintain the correct temperature; if it becomes too soft, the shape will flow together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

## Applications in Precision Optics

This unique property of glass, for which there is no substitute, is primarily utilized in the manufacturing of cylindrical and miniature cylindrical lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

For example, a slice from a one-foot bar of glass can be [[high_precision_machining_techniques|CNC ground]] to an aspheric profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. This bar is then heated in an oven and drawn into hundreds of feet of these lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. The resulting lenses are nearly diffraction-limited and aspherically corrected cylindrical lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. These specialized lenses are subsequently cut up and installed in mounts to manufacture micro lenses for lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

While an esoteric use, this drawing process is considered the best method for manufacturing precise prismatic shapes like squares, triangles, or aspheric lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

This article outlines several techniques and tips for efficient and accurate drilling, particularly focusing on methods that can save time and overcome common shop challenges.

## Timesaving Drill Starting Technique

Conventionally, to drill a hole, one would use a [[basics_of_drilling_and_center_punching | center punch]] to make a mark, then a [[techniques_for_precise_hole_drilling_and_reaming | center drill]] to deepen the hole, and finally a regular drill bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. However, a significant amount of time can be saved by skipping both the center punch and the center drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The problem with directly starting a drill without a center mark is that the drill tends to wander, especially on sloped surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

*   **Technique:** To prevent wandering, simply "peck" the drill into the workpiece a few times quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. After a few pecks, the drill will no longer wander, allowing for a precise start and saving considerable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Emergency Left-Hand Tapping

Situations may arise where a left-hand thread is required (e.g., an M6 left-hand thread), but only right-hand taps are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. An emergency left-hand tap can be fashioned from a right-hand tap.

### Modifying a Right-Hand Tap

1.  **Grind Flat:** Take a right-hand tap and grind it completely flat, leaving only a section in the middle that is approximately one-third of the tap's diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
2.  **Add Rake Angle (Optional):** For better tapping performance, two grooves can be ground into the flattened section using a hand grinder to create a rake angle for the cutting edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Tapping Process with Modified Tap

1.  **Drill Hole:** First, drill the appropriate hole for the tap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
2.  **Insert Tap:** Place the modified tap into the drilled hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
3.  **Apply Cutting Fluid:** Add cutting fluid to aid the tapping process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
4.  **Reverse Drill Press:** The crucial step is to run the drill press **backwards** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Instead of the usual forward rotation, reverse the drill press direction to cut a left-hand thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

This method allows for the creation of a perfect left-hand thread using a modified right-hand tap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

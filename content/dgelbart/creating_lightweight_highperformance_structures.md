A press, particularly when combined with a [[creating_custom_springs_and_minimizing_machining_using_water_jet | water jet]], is highly useful for manufacturing lightweight, high-performance structures, especially for applications like airborne components where stiffness and minimal weight are critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Principles of Lightweight Structure Design

The primary method to achieve stiffness in lightweight structures is by incorporating closed-form pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This concept is similar to how a car achieves its [[techniques_to_improve_rigidity_in_structural_assemblies | rigidity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Importance of Closed-Form Pieces and Ribs

A flat strip of metal, even if thick, lacks significant [[techniques_to_improve_rigidity_in_structural_assemblies | rigidity]] and can be easily bent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
However, pressing a rib into the material significantly increases its moment of inertia and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. While simply bending a sheet without a press makes it strong in one direction, it remains weak torsionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Achieving Stiffness and Torsional Strength

To achieve strength in both bending and torsion, a closed shape is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This can be done by pressing two ribs into a material and then spot welding them together, creating a structure that has the same weight but is stiff in both bending and torsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## Materials for High-Performance Structures

For normal structures, steel (often powder-coated) is suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. However, for genuinely high-performance applications, certain stainless steels are ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Heat-Treatable Stainless Steels

Materials like 17-7 stainless steel, or other similar alloys, can be hardened through heat treatment cycles without needing quenching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This allows for forming the part (e.g., pressing out, spot welding) and then placing the entire assembly in an oven for a temperature cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The result is a material with a very high elastic range, meaning it will spring back even if bent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Manufacturing Techniques using a Press

A press excels at straightening and flattening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Its capabilities are greatly expanded when used in conjunction with a [[creating_custom_springs_and_minimizing_machining_using_water_jet | water jet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Tooling Creation with Water Jet

The [[creating_custom_springs_and_minimizing_machining_using_water_jet | water jet]] allows for rapid creation of special tooling shapes in minutes from mild steel plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This tooling can then be used in the press to form shapes in sheet metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Specific Examples

*   **Reinforcing Box Covers**: For lightweight box covers, reinforcement can be achieved by cutting two layers (e.g., an X-shape with tabs and a backing layer) on a [[creating_custom_springs_and_minimizing_machining_using_water_jet | water jet]], spot welding them, and then pressing the desired shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This method is significantly faster than using a [[efficient_milling_strategies_and_tool_selection | CNC mill]], as clamping and other considerations are simplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Creating Cylindrical Box Covers**: To make cylindrical boxes, round covers with a bent-up lip are needed for spot welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. A [[creating_custom_springs_and_minimizing_machining_using_water_jet | water jet]] can produce both male and female tooling for this purpose simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Proper clearance (e.g., 1.5-2 mm for 1 mm thick material) is essential to prevent jamming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. After pressing, edges can be sanded for a clean finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Pressing Methods

#### Pressing Against Rubber/Lead

One method involves pressing a male tool against a very hard rubber or polyurethane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This creates a nice rib but may lack sharp definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. If higher definition is desired, pressing against lead (which can be melted and reused) can achieve sharper details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

#### Male and Female Die Pressing

For much sharper lines and deeper draws, a male and female die setup is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The key challenge is aligning the dies when sheet metal is in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. A common trick is to first press the material roughly against rubber to create a preliminary shape that registers the two halves, then use this pre-formed shape to accurately align the male and female dies for the final, precise press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

#### Deep Drawing and Annealing

For very deep or complex shapes, multiple drawing steps may be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. After an initial draw, the material might need to be annealed (heated to red hot and allowed to cool) to restore ductility before further drawing, preventing tearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### Pressing vs. Shearing

The difference between pressing and shearing lies in the sharpness of the tool's corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. If a steel tool has sharp, unrounded corners and is pressed into rubber or lead, it can actually punch out (shear) the part instead of just forming it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This can be useful for producing many identical parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. If corners are rounded, the material will press; if sharp, it might shear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

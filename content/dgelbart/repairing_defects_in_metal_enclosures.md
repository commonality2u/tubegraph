When fabricating metal enclosures, mistakes or defects can occur, such as an extra hole, a misplaced cut, or issues with structural rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Rather than scrapping the part, many of these defects can be repaired using techniques like spot welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Repairing Holes and Cuts with Spot Welding

Spot welding is an effective method for repairing unwanted holes or cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This technique avoids the need to discard the part, saving time and material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Process for Holes
To fix an extra hole, an oversized piece of metal, slightly larger than the defect, is placed over it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This piece, which doesn't necessarily have to be round (a square plug slightly bigger than the hole works), is then melted into the hole using a spot welder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The high current of the spot welder ensures the metal flows and overfills the hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Process for Slots
For an extra slot, a strip of metal slightly wider than the slot (by about half a millimeter or a millimeter) is cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This strip is then placed over the slot and melted in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Spot Welder Settings
When spot welding, especially for larger areas, a high setting (e.g., number eight) is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Post-Weld Finishing
After the defect is melted and filled, the excess material needs to be cut off and the corner touched up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. For a perfect finish, the top surface can be sanded, as imperfections may show after [[preparation_and_painting_of_metal_enclosures | painting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Improving Rigidity and Squareness
If an enclosure is flimsy or not perfectly square after [[bending_techniques_and_considerations_for_metal_enclosures | bending]], its rigidity can be improved by adding braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Braces can be cut from the same sheet metal as the enclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

### Process for Braces
Four braces are typically used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. They are spot welded to one side of the enclosure first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. The enclosure is then adjusted to an exact right angle against a square, and the other side of each brace is welded to secure the shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. These braces, while not critical for function (as the cover often provides support), offer extra stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

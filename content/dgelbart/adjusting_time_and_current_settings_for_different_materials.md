A spot welder is a versatile machine, with some units being homemade but generally sharing a similar appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This article focuses on adjusting its settings for various materials and applications.

## Setting Parameters

When spot welding sheet metal, the primary setting to adjust is time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While some machines also have a pressure setting, it can typically be ignored and set to maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The time setting, however, must be carefully calibrated based on the metal's thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Determining the Correct Time Setting

To find the correct time setting for a specific metal thickness, perform a series of test welds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. For example, with 0.7mm (Gauge 22) sheet metal, begin with a setting of two cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04">[01:04]</a>. Conduct additional welds at higher settings, such as three and four cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37">[01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39">[01:39]</a>.

#### Tear Test
After making test welds, perform a "tear test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44">[01:44]</a>. This involves tearing the metal to see if it rips *around* the weld without the weld itself opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46">[01:46]</a>. If the weld holds and the surrounding metal tears, the setting is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52">[01:52]</a>. For the example 0.7mm metal, two cycles proved to be the correct setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19">[02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23">[02:23]</a>.

The optimal setting will change if the material or thickness is altered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26">[02:26]</a>. Keeping a chart for different materials (e.g., stainless steel, mild steel) and thicknesses is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34">[02:34]</a>.

### Current vs. Time Adjustment

Always set the current to its highest level and primarily adjust the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19">[05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21">[05:21]</a>. Higher current for shorter times leads to more efficient welds, as less heat escapes sideways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31">[05:31]</a>. The only exception is if the lowest time setting is still too high; in that case, the current can be lowered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24">[05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01">[06:01]</a>.

## Material Compatibility

Spot welders are typically suitable for welding mild steel and stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43">[02:43]</a>. Non-ferrous metals, like copper, cannot be effectively welded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46">[02:46]</a>. Exotic metals such as tungsten, titanium, and niobium can also be welded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53">[02:53]</a>.

The principle behind spot welding is that current passing through materials that don't conduct electricity well generates significant heat (IÂ²R) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03">[03:03]</a>. If a metal conducted electricity too well (e.g., copper), the electrodes would weld to each other instead of the workpiece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10">[03:10]</a>.

### Machine Capacity

A spot welder with a capacity of 15 to 25 KVA is generally recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27">[06:27]</a>. A 15 KVA unit can weld steel up to 3mm thick (Gauge 12 to Gauge 12) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34">[06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41">[06:41]</a>, typically requiring about 15 cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50">[06:50]</a>. It can handle slightly heavier stainless steel, such as Gauge 10 to Gauge 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13">[07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16">[07:16]</a>. A 25 KVA unit allows for welding one gauge thicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22">[07:22]</a>.

Spot welders are not designed for very thick materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25">[07:25]</a>. Conveniently, where spot welding becomes less effective for thicker materials, TIG welding becomes easier, even for inexperienced operators, ensuring a continuous range of welding capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30">[07:30]</a>.

## Weld Strength and Removal

### Temporary vs. Permanent Welds

Spot welders offer the flexibility to create both temporary and permanent welds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29">[03:29]</a>. By using a lower setting (e.g., one cycle for material where two cycles is permanent), a weak weld can be produced that can be broken off by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39">[03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42">[03:42]</a>. This "temporary glue" effect is useful for prototyping, allowing parts to be positioned and adjusted before committing to a permanent weld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46">[03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20">[04:20]</a>.

### Removing Permanent Welds

Once a permanent weld is made, especially if there are multiple welds, it cannot be twisted or pried off without tearing the metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41">[04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46">[04:46]</a>. The only effective way to remove a permanent spot weld is to drill it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51">[04:51]</a>. The weld typically leaves a center mark, making it easy to [[drill_press_techniques_and_timesaving_tips | drill]] with a 3-4mm drill bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54">[04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57">[04:57]</a>.

## Spot Welding Applications

### Welding Rods

Spot welders are highly efficient at welding rods, even large ones (e.g., 1/2 inch rod to 1/2 inch rod with a 15 KVA unit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08">[08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33">[08:33]</a>. This is due to the small contact area, which results in very high current density, and the heat escaping primarily along the rod in one direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15">[08:15]</a>. The same tear test principle applies: the rod should shear before the weld opens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04">[09:04]</a>.

### Welding Captive Hardware

Spot welding is very useful for attaching captive hardware such as:
*   Hinges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37">[09:37]</a>
*   Nuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37">[09:37]</a>
*   Studs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37">[09:37]</a>
*   Standoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37">[09:37]</a>
*   Latches and closures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44">[09:44]</a>

There is a wide variety of commercially available spot weldable hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47">[09:47]</a>. For studs and standoffs, specialized hollow electrodes with a ball and spring mechanism hold the hardware in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56">[09:56]</a>. A small mark (e.g., from a water jet cutter or a 1mm drill hole) on the workpiece allows the stud's pip to accurately locate the weld point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48">[10:48]</a>. The tear test for studs involves breaking the stud without opening the weld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21">[11:21]</a>. Standard round-head screws (Allen, slot, or Phillips) can also be welded as studs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36">[11:36]</a>.

For nuts, "spot welding nuts" with three projections and a pilot shoulder are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37">[12:37]</a>. A hole is cut for the pilot, and the nut is welded with two flat electrodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50">[12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58">[12:58]</a>. Due to the larger contact area, these typically require a higher setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17">[13:17]</a>. Welding can eject metal into the threads, sometimes requiring a tap to clean them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31">[13:31]</a>. Alternatively, a plain washer can be welded to the back of thin sheet metal to provide sufficient thickness for tapping a thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48">[13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57">[13:57]</a>.

### Welding Balls

Spot welding balls is useful for [[materials_and_construction_methods_for_precision_machinery | kinematic mounts]], bars with balls at the end, and adjustable couplings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56">[15:56]</a>. A conical electrode with a conical hole is used to hold the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17">[16:17]</a>. Balls are inexpensive and accurate, making them ideal for various adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38">[16:38]</a>. When welding a ball to a rod, a special collet adapter is used to grip the rod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14">[17:14]</a>. The ball must be smaller than the hole to allow removal after welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30">[17:30]</a>. A low setting is typically used due to the small contact area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48">[17:48]</a>. If there's sufficient contact area between the copper electrode and the ball, no mark will be left on the ball's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15">[18:15]</a>.

### Invisible Welds

For applications requiring a perfectly smooth exterior (e.g., aesthetics, medical devices for cleanliness), invisible welds are desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30">[18:30]</a>. While textbooks suggest using one flat electrode and one regular electrode, this often results in an inward pull that still leaves a mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52">[18:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01">[19:01]</a>.

To achieve an truly invisible weld, a special electrode with a very small dimple (a few millimeters in diameter, 50 microns deep) at the weld point is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28">[19:28]</a>. This dimple pushes the metal outwards by an amount that compensates for the shrinkage when the molten metal cools, resulting in a perfectly flat surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45">[19:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50">[19:50]</a>. Minimal sanding might be needed, but it's far less than smoothing a whole surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53">[19:53]</a>.

### Welding Non-Weldable Materials

When faced with materials that resist welding (e.g., Nitinol, beryllium copper, phosphor bronze), they can often be trapped between two layers of weldable stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13">[20:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28">[20:28]</a>. The weld then goes across the non-weldable material and through the stainless steel layers, fusing everything together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30">[20:30]</a>. For example, a Nitinol wire can be slid into stainless steel hypodermic tubing and then welded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17">[21:17]</a>. When welding such assemblies, it's beneficial to bend the ends to create a gradual radius, avoiding abrupt transitions that can lead to weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31">[21:31]</a>. The setting used should be slightly higher than for just welding stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15">[22:15]</a>.

### Creating Custom Electrodes

Many spot welding tasks require custom electrodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00">[23:00]</a>. Electrodes are typically made from copper bars (square or round) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:15">[23:15]</a>. Copper is easy to bend and becomes work-hardened, but it can be annealed if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:24">[23:24]</a>.

The tips of electrodes, however, are usually made from harder alloys like copper-tungsten or copper-chrome alloy to resist squeezing and wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41">[23:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:58">[23:58]</a>. These tips can be machined with a taper and pressed into a tapered hole in the copper electrode body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:18">[24:18]</a>. A simple "D-bit" (a tapered dowel pin ground flat to half its diameter) can be used to machine the tapered hole in copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:32">[24:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44">[24:44]</a>.

Custom electrodes can be designed for various purposes:
*   Reaching deep inside cavities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:25">[25:25]</a>
*   Welding thin electrodes for small spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:14">[26:14]</a>
*   Offset electrodes to navigate around metal folds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:18">[26:18]</a>
*   Electrodes for welding blades (e.g., bandsaw blades) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33">[26:33]</a>
*   Electrodes to weld components at precise angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46">[26:46]</a>
*   Special electrodes to hold small parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:11">[27:11]</a>

### Preventing Marks on One Side

To avoid marking one side of a workpiece, use an electrode with a much larger contact area on that side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:28">[27:28]</a>. If the contact area is significantly larger (e.g., 30mmÂ² compared to a 3mmÂ² weld), that side will not heat up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36">[27:36]</a>.

### Watertight Enclosures

Spot welders can create watertight enclosures by applying a very thin bead of RTV silicone between the metal pieces before welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:35">[28:35]</a>. The pressure of the weld displaces the silicone, allowing the weld to form through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:54">[28:54]</a>. Welding on a dense pitch (e.g., setting four) creates a completely watertight seal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57">[28:57]</a>, even if there's smoke or no visible spark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06">[29:06]</a>.

### Salvaging Material for Water Jet Cutting

A spot welder can be used to [[minimal_material_supply_for_a_shop_or_lab | salvage]] small pieces of material for a water jet cutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:37">[29:37]</a>. Because water jets have a clamping area, they can't cut all the way to the edge of a small piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:46">[29:46]</a>. To use all of a small piece, a larger scrap piece can be attached to it.

If the materials are thin, one piece can be spot welded on top of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:02">[30:02]</a>. For thicker materials where a step is undesirable, the pieces can be butt-welded flush at the joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:08">[30:08]</a>. This creates a horizontal melt, providing enough strength for clamping in the water jet without creating a step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:37">[30:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44">[30:44]</a>.

## Safety

Spot welding is generally safe at 2.5 volts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04">[08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:04">[28:04]</a>, but it produces sparks and molten metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04">[01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12">[01:12]</a>. Safety precautions include wearing goggles (or glasses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07">[01:07]</a> and avoiding sandals, as molten metal can drip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14">[01:14]</a>. Despite the low voltage, significant magnetic forces are present due to high currents (e.g., 5,000 amps), which can attract magnetic objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19">[28:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:27">[28:27]</a>.

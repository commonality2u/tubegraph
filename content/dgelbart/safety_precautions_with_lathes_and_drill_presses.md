This article focuses on [[unexpected_hazards_of_woodworking_machines | unexpected safety hazards]] in a workshop, assuming basic [[safety_rules_in_workshops | workshop rules]] are already known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While machines like [[dangers_of_grinder_machines_and_brittle_wheels | grinders]], [[safe_handling_of_hand_tools | hand tools]], and hydraulic [[safety_precautions_when_using_a_press | presses]] also present hazards, this guide will concentrate on lathes and drill presses.

## Lathe Safety

Lathes are considered fairly safe machines, but they have two primary unexpected dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### Entanglement Hazards

A significant danger involves threads on rotating parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. If a finger is placed inside a turning thread, it can be pulled in and sheared off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Even briefly touching the outside of rotating parts with a rag is very dangerous, as the rag can get wrapped around and pull your hand into the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

When working with a lathe, it is crucial to avoid having any loose sleeves, earphone wires, long hair, or anything else hanging off you that could touch a rotating part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Once something wraps around, it creates a tenacious "capstan effect" that locks it, making it impossible to let go and pulling you into the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The fundamental safety rule for lathes is never to touch anything rotating with rags, hands, or anything that can be pulled into the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### Machining Brass

Another unexpected danger when using a lathe is working with brass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Brass has a property of pulling the tool into the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

*   **Specialized Tools**: Tools designed for brass typically have a zero rake angle, meaning the cutting edge touches the brass squarely, not at a sharp angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Similarly, drills used for brass often have a flat ground at the end so the helix angle doesn't create a sharp angle with the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Risk of Pull-in**: If these special tools are not used, the lathe tool can be pulled into the chuck, or the drill can pull the drilling chuck out of the tailstock and into the brass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. If the chuck is pulled out, it will spin with the workpiece and can fly out if the hole is deep enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Drill Press Safety

A drill press is a fairly safe machine, but caution must be taken regarding clamping the part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

### Clamping the Workpiece

*   **Securing the Part**: Parts should always be securely clamped, typically in a vice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Awkward Shapes**: If a part is too awkward to clamp in a vice, it should not be held directly by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. The drill can catch the part, causing it to spin, and sharp edges can cut your hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. In such cases, use a locking plier, like a vice grip, to hold the part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Drilling Speed**: When holding a difficult part with locking pliers, drill at a slower speed to prevent rapid incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Center Drilling**: Always start a hole with a center drill, as a center mark alone may not be enough to guide a larger drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Step Drilling**: For large drills (e.g., larger than 10 mm), it's best to drill in two steps: first, drill with a smaller diameter bit (e.g., half the final diameter), then enlarge to the full diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### Brass Drilling on a Drill Press

The dangers associated with drilling brass on a lathe also apply to a drill press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. When a drill breaks through brass, it can pull the workpiece up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. If the piece is not very secure, it can be pulled out of the vice, or the drill chuck itself can be pulled out of the drill press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

### Protecting Workpiece Surfaces

*   **Danger of Rags**: Never place a rag under the material you are drilling to protect the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. As soon as the drill breaks through, it will touch the rag, and the rag will wrap around the drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This has a 100% probability of happening, causing the rag and potentially the workpiece to fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Safer Alternative**: To protect the surface, use a sheet of paper instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. The drill will simply go through the paper, which will not wrap around the drill because it lacks fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

This article describes a unique process for 3D printing metal and ceramic objects, known as "Cast to Sinter", developed by Rapidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. This method yields parts with the highest resolution and best surface finish compared to other metal 3D printing techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.

## Overview of the "Cast to Sinter" Method

The "Cast to Sinter" process leverages the capabilities of high-resolution plastic resin printers (SLA machines) to create highly detailed plastic models, which are then converted into metal or ceramic parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The fundamental principle involves creating a precisely sized plastic model, making a silicone mold from it, casting a metal or ceramic slurry into the mold, freezing and demolding the part, drying it, and finally sintering it in a furnace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. SLA Model Creation
The process begins with 3D printing a plastic model using an [[high_resolution_3d_printing_for_metals_and_ceramics | SLA]] or resin printer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. A crucial step is to scale up this plastic model by 19% to account for the shrinkage that occurs during the [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. These [[high_resolution_3d_printing_for_metals_and_ceramics | SLA printers]] are capable of producing mirror-finish, super high-resolution parts at low costs (some under $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### 2. Silicone Rubber Mold Creation
A silicone rubber mold is made from the oversized [[high_resolution_3d_printing_for_metals_and_ceramics | SLA]] model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Preparation**: The SLA model must be spray-painted with any kind of paint or varnish to prevent photopolymers from inhibiting the polymerization of the silicone rubber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Silicone Choice**: A self-degassing, strong silicone rubber like BVDino's blue 30A durometer silicone is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Molding**: The silicone is mixed (1:1 by volume or weight) and poured over the SLA model placed in a container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Curing can take a few hours, or be accelerated to 2 hours in a warm place (60-80°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Demolding**: The silicone mold is cut with a knife (with alignment marks) to easily remove the plastic part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Silicone rubber maintains its shape without distortion during this step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Simple shapes can use a one-piece mold that flips inside out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. Complex parts with internal channels may require multi-piece molds designed for injection under pressure with air vents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

### 3. Metal/Ceramic Slurry Preparation
A slurry is prepared by mixing metal powder (e.g., 17-4 stainless steel) or ceramic powder (e.g., alumina) with a specialized binder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. For high resolution, fine powder (10-25 micron) is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Binder Functions**: The binder is critical and performs four main functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>:
    1.  **Green Strength**: Holds the "green part" together after demolding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.
    2.  **Ice Crystal Inhibition**: Prevents the formation of large ice crystals during freezing, which would degrade part strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.
    3.  **Surface Tension Control**: Reduces slurry surface tension for good wetting and bubble release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.
    4.  **Shear Thinning Enhancement**: Allows viscosity to drop under shear (e.g., vibration) for mold filling, then rapidly increase when shear stops to prevent particle settling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.
*   **Mixing**: The mixture is thoroughly mixed, typically with a drill and bent wire, until it becomes a smooth, pourable consistency like honey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   **Degassing**: Air bubbles are removed by partial vacuum or by vibrating the mix, allowing the high-density paste to push out air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

### 4. Casting into the Mold
The prepared slurry is poured into the silicone mold, which is secured (e.g., placed back into the original cup with grease and tape) to prevent leaks and maintain alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Pouring is done under strong vibration, flowing from one side to ensure the liquid fills every cavity and pushes out air bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. A "raft" (a plate of the same material) is also cast separately to be placed under the main object during [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering]] to prevent sticking and distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### 5. Freezing and Demolding
The mold with the slurry is placed into a freeze dryer (e.g., Harvest Right unit) set to -40°C for a minimum of 2 hours until completely frozen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
*   **Magic of Freezing**: The freezing step is critical because the frozen mixture of metal powder and water forms a composite material that is immensely stronger than ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. This allows for the demolding of complex parts with undercuts, cross-holes, or threads without breaking or damaging them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.
*   **Demolding**: The frozen part is then pulled out of the silicone mold, often with brutal force, without damaging delicate features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

### 6. Drying
The frozen "green part" is immediately placed back into the freeze dryer for a drying cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. This is the longest step, typically taking about 20 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

### 7. Sintering
The dry green part is then transferred to a furnace for [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
*   **Furnace Type**:
    *   For metals, a vacuum [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering]] furnace (like Rapidia's) is required to achieve high-quality, high-density parts (around 99% density) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. These furnaces are expensive (over $100,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
    *   For ceramics (e.g., alumina, zirconia), a much cheaper air furnace (around $4,000) can be used, as ceramics are typically [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintered]] in air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.
*   **Raft and Separation Layer**: The part is placed on the pre-cast raft, which has been sprinkled with alumina powder to prevent the part from fusing to the raft during [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
*   **Cycle**: The furnace automatically runs the [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering]] cycle (e.g., 12 hours for a rapid cycle for stainless steel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Furnaces can hold multiple shelves to [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sinter]] many parts at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

## Advantages of this Method

This "Cast to Sinter" process offers several significant advantages:
*   **High Resolution and Surface Finish**: It produces the highest resolution and best surface finish of any metal 3D printing method known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>. Parts can achieve a mirror finish with simple electropolishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This is beneficial for medical parts or plastic injection molding dies, reducing tedious manual polishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Complex Geometries**: It can reproduce the finest details, including thin walls with high aspect ratios, cross holes, and cross threads perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Material Versatility**: The process works for any metal or ceramic that can be [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintered]], requiring very little binder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. Examples include tungsten carbide and alumina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness**:
    *   **Low Cost Per Part**: The primary cost is the metal powder, with molds being inexpensive and reusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. Metal powder is cheaper when purchased as powder than as filament or pre-bound slurries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>.
    *   **Affordable Ceramic System**: A complete ceramic 3D printing system (SLA printer, freeze dryer, ceramic furnace) can cost under $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
*   **Small Quantity and Exotic Materials**: It is well-suited for very small quantities and exotic materials like platinum or gold, as only a small amount of powder needs to be mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.
*   **Rapid Production with Multiple Molds**: Dozens of molds can be made and filled at once, and molds can be reused in as little as two hours after demolding the frozen part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.

## Disadvantages

Despite its advantages, the process has limitations:
*   **Manual Steps**: It involves many manual steps and delays, unlike fully automated printing systems like Rapidia's printers which are more "push-button" operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.
*   **Distortion**: Parts can experience more distortion than those produced by regular 3D printing methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. This is primarily due to density gradients caused by metal particles settling in the slurry before freezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>. While symmetric parts might have only 30-50 micron out-of-roundness, complex parts with overhangs can see distortion up to 1% (hundreds of microns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. Supports must also be cast for parts with overhangs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.
*   **Shape Limitations**: It cannot produce designs that cannot be cast, such as hollow infills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

## Equipment Costs

*   **Ceramic System**: A complete system for ceramics (SLA printer, freeze dryer, and an air [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering]] furnace) can cost under $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.
*   **Metal System**: For metals, the system cost is significantly higher, primarily due to the necessity of a vacuum [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering]] furnace, which alone costs over $100,000 (total around $140,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.

Rapidia has placed the IP for this process in the public domain to encourage wider adoption, and they offer the binder and metal powder to those interested in experimenting with the method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

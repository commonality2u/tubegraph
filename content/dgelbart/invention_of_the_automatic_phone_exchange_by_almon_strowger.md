The automatic phone exchange, invented by Almon Strowger, revolutionized telephone communication by removing the need for human switchboard operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## The Problem with Manual Exchanges

Before Strowger's invention, telephone exchanges operated manually. This involved a matrix of jacks where a phone operator would physically plug in connections to direct a call to its destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Almon Strowger, an undertaker in Kansas City, faced a significant business problem due to this system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. He discovered that whenever someone called for an undertaker, the switchboard operator would redirect clients to a friend of hers, not to Strowger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. As there were only two undertakers in Kansas City at the time, all the business went to Strowger's competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Enraged by this, Strowger decided to invent a machine that would put all phone operators out of a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Strowger's Ingenious Solution

Despite having no formal technical education, Strowger was a genius who conceived of an automated solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. He aimed to imitate the motion of a phone operator by building a miniature matrix of connectors operated by electromagnets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

His invention required several innovations:
*   **The Phone Dial** Strowger was the first to conceptualize the phone dial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The design of this dial has remained largely unchanged since his time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. When a user turns the dial, it sends electrical pulses. These pulses are generated as the dial slowly returns to its original position, ensuring a constant rate of pulses regardless of how fast the user pulls the dial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Two-Dimensional Switching** Strowger's mechanical system used electromagnets to mimic a phone operator's movements in two dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. For example, in a 100-phone exchange (the first one he built), dialing the first number would cause the connection to move up to the correct row. Dialing the second digit would then turn it to the right column, selecting the correct connection within a 10x10 matrix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. When the call ended, the system would reset to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. For exchanges with more than 100 phones, multiple selectors were used, with the first selecting the first two digits, the next selector for the next two digits, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Legacy and Impact

Strowger's automatic phone exchange was invented in 1888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. He was also a shrewd businessman, forming the Strowger Automatic Telephone Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This company later merged to become the Automatic Electric Company, whose traces still exist today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. He began manufacturing dial phones and these automated exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This design proved incredibly durable, lasting for over a century in many places and several countries, including parts of Africa, where it remains the phone exchange system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

Perhaps the most surprising aspect of Strowger's story is that ten years after his business became successful and his phones were widely adopted, he sold his shares in the Strowger Automatic Telephone Company and returned to his original profession of undertaking for the rest of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

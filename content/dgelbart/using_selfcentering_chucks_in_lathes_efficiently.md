Lathes commonly utilize two primary types of self-centering chucks: the three-jaw and the four-jaw. While both offer self-centering capabilities, the four-jaw chuck provides distinct advantages for specific machining tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Advantages of Four-Jaw Chucks

The [[using_keyless_chucks_and_fourjaw_chucks_on_lathes | four-jaw chuck]] is generally considered superior due to its ability to grip square stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Additionally, it minimizes distortion of the workpiece because the gripping force is distributed across four points, rather than three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Gripping Hexagonal Stock

Many users mistakenly believe that a three-jaw chuck is necessary for gripping hexagonal stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. However, a hexagon inherently possesses four points that are equidistant from its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This geometric property allows a hexagon to be securely gripped in a [[using_keyless_chucks_and_fourjaw_chucks_on_lathes | four-jaw chuck]] with virtually no run-out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

A demonstration of this technique involves:
1.  Gripping a hexagonal piece in a [[using_keyless_chucks_and_fourjaw_chucks_on_lathes | four-jaw chuck]] and observing its run-out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
2.  Performing a cleanup cut to establish a perfect zero run-out reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
3.  Removing and then rechucking the same hexagonal piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
4.  Upon rechucking, the run-out remains minimal, confirming the effectiveness of using a [[using_keyless_chucks_and_fourjaw_chucks_on_lathes | four-jaw chuck]] for hexagonal stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Repeat Accuracy

While rechucking may introduce a tiny bit of run-out, this is typically attributed to the inherent repeat accuracy of the chuck itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Precision chucks commonly repeat to approximately 30 microns when a workpiece is removed and then rechucked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

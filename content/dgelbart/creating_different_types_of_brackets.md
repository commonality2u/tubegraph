Brackets are commonly used components that often require stiffening to prevent flimsiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Several methods can be employed to create and stiffen brackets using a press brake.

## Basic Right-Angle Bracket
A basic right-angle bracket can be made from a piece of sheet metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. However, this simple bend often results in a flimsy bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Methods for Stiffening Brackets
There are several ways to make a bracket more rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. These [[bending_techniques_and_considerations_for_metal_enclosures | techniques]] are particularly useful when [[designing_with_wire_and_sheet_metal | designing with sheet metal]].

### 1. Using a Simple Brace
The simplest method involves adding a brace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   Bend a separate brace piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   Hold the brace against a square to ensure accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   Spot weld the brace to the bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

### 2. Using a Triangular Stiffener Piece
A second approach uses a triangular stiffener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   Take a triangular piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   Bend the two sides of the triangular piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   Insert the triangular piece into the bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   Spot weld it in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   This method does not require a square for alignment, as the triangular piece itself is bent square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### 3. Bending a Rib into the Bracket
For situations where space is limited or for creating very simple yet stiffer brackets, a rib can be bent directly into the part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This provides immense stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Process:**
    *   Leave a space on the press brake between two segments of the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
    *   Minutely round the corner of the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
    *   Insert a hardened steel blade with a rounded top into this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This blade serves as a form of [[custom_tooling_for_bending | custom tooling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
    *   Ensure the blade is positioned about flush with the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
    *   When the bend is made, the blade simultaneously forms a rib <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness:** The rib significantly increases stiffness, with most flex occurring only in the unstiffened portions of the part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

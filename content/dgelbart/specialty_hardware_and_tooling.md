## High Precision Area Tools

The high-precision area of the shop contains equipment designed for extreme accuracy in machining and measurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### Moor Number 3 Jig Borer

This machine is noted for its exceptional precision, a significant human achievement in engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Accuracy**: Accurate to about 1 micron (40 millionths of an inch) in all aspects, including orthogonality of axes, straightness of motions, calibration of micrometer lead screws, and trueness of rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Traceability**: Comes with a test certificate traceable to the National Institute of Standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   **Thermal Design**:
    *   Lead screws are designed to warm up slightly, nullifying initial errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
    *   The headstock is made of Invar, a metal that doesn't change size with temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
    *   Everything is properly heat shielded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
    *   Final scrapers wear aluminized aprons to prevent body heat from distorting the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   **Cost**: While new, these machines cost around $80,000-$100,000, but can now be purchased on eBay for $2,000-$3,000 due to industry decline in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

### Video Microscope

An essential accessory for the jig borer, used for precisely locating features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Helps locate an edge or the center of a hole to 1 micron accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   **Magnification**: Provides a 1000x magnified view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Alignment Method**: The most reliable method involves rotating the microscope to determine the true axis of rotation of the machine, allowing for precise alignment with targets as small as 5 microns in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

### Rotary Tables and Dividing Heads

These devices provide highly accurate angular division and are used in conjunction with precision machines like the jig borer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   **Two-Axis Rotary Table**: Features an optical readout (like a theodolite) for tilt and rotation, offering accuracy of about 1 to 2 arc seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   **Ultradex**: Considered the most accurate device globally for dividing accuracy. It is manufactured by A.A. Gage and Moore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Mechanism**: Uses two face gears with 360 teeth that can mesh at every one-degree interval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. Repeated meshing wears out high spots, averaging positions for high accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
    *   **Bearing Independence**: Its clever design doesn't rely on bearing accuracy, as the meshed gears define the center of rotation, achieving a tenth of an arc second accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Example of Accuracy**: A tenth of an arc second is equivalent to lifting the end of a kilometer-long steel bar by one millimeter, or a mile-long bar by one-sixteenth of an inch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

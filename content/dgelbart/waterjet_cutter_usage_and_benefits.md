The waterjet cutter is a key machine for [[prototyping_using_water_jet_cutting | prototyping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While it is the most expensive piece of equipment needed, it offers significant versatility and precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Capabilities and Advantages
A waterjet cutter, such as an OMEX 2654 model, is highly versatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It can cut practically any material, up to two inches or more in thickness, and produces a very clean cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Unlike a [[cnc_plasma_cutter_as_an_alternative | CNC plasma cutter]], which is about a tenth of the cost but much less versatile, a waterjet can cut all metals equally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The [[cnc_plasma_cutter_as_an_alternative | plasma cutter]] is limited to metals and does not cut all of them equally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For budget reasons or home use, a [[cnc_plasma_cutter_as_an_alternative | CNC plasma cutter]] can perform many tasks similar to a waterjet, though the waterjet remains the ideal machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### [[modifications_to_improve_waterjet_productivity | Modifications to improve waterjet productivity]]
Several modifications can significantly enhance the productivity and user experience of a waterjet cutter.

#### Sliding Basket
The most crucial modification is the addition of a sliding basket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Small parts, and sometimes even large ones, can unexpectedly fall into the tank, which is filled with discarded garnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Once a part drops into the tank, it is largely lost, with very low chances of retrieval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

*   **Functionality:** The basket rests on the bottom part of the U-beam that holds the sleds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. It must be positioned about 8 inches (20 cm) below the top of the sleds to prevent it from being cut by the jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Retrieval:** The basket can be moved by a pulley, allowing users to pick it up and retrieve lost small parts and metal slugs that can be reused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. It sits on a cradle, making it easy to drop in and move into position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Necessity:** For sheet metal, parts can sometimes be left hanging by a tab and broken off, but this method is ineffective for materials thicker than an eighth of an inch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Therefore, the basket is essential for saving time with thicker materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

#### Laser Pointer for Beam Alignment
A highly desirable modification is a laser pointer that shines through the beam path to indicate exactly where the jet will hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This feature is expected to become available from OMEX Corporation, but it can also be homemade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

*   **Mechanism:** It is precisely made to fit where the feed tube normally goes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. To keep the nozzle clean from water, it is plugged into an air supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Accurate Placement:** The laser spot shows exactly where the jet will hit, as it passes through the same feed tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   **Wear Measurement:** The shape of the laser spot can indicate wear in the mixing tube, signaling when it needs replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   **Job Resumption:** This alignment aid is particularly important when needing to stop and then restart a cutting job from a precise point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
    *   **Precision Registration:** It is crucial for registering cuts to pre-existing features, such as pre-drilled holes, when combining precision holes with waterjet cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

#### Splash Guard
For protection against splashes, a cap is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. A simple and effective solution is using half of a tennis ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This is superior to most supplied caps because it takes up very little space, allowing for cuts close to the edge, and can be easily flipped over to observe the cutting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

#### Clamping System
Adding clamps is another useful modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. These clamps, which can be cut on the waterjet itself, can secure materials ranging from 0 to 1 inch in thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Materials thicker than one inch are typically heavy enough to not require clamping, as their own weight provides sufficient stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

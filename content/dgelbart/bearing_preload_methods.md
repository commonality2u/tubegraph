Bearings are designed to have inherent play and are typically intended to operate in preloaded pairs to eliminate this play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. While a single bearing might fit perfectly on a shaft, it will still exhibit significant play internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Preloading ensures that the shaft remains stable without movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Methods for Preloading Bearings

### Hard Preloading

Hard preloading involves applying a fixed force or dimension to press the bearings against each other.

*   **Stepped Shafts or Housings:** Bearings can be preloaded by incorporating a step on the outside or inside of the shaft or housing design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Sleeves:** For standard off-the-shelf shafts (like dowel pins) that are not machined with steps, a sleeve can be placed on the shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The housing then pushes the two bearings together, squeezing them against the sleeve to achieve preload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Snap Rings and Tubes:** A groove can be cut with a boring head to insert a snap ring, which stops the bearing within a block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. A tube of sufficient length can then be used to preload the bearings against the snap ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Soft Preloading with Washers

If the housing accuracy isn't precise enough to maintain a critical preload, spring or wave washers can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. A wave washer has a wavy shape that can be compressed flat, providing some flexibility in the preload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This method is observed in gearboxes, where waterjet-cut additional plates with a wave washer are permanently mounted with screws to contain and preload the bearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Addressing Loose Fits

If a bearing fit is too loose on the shaft or in the housing, Loctite can provide a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. A single drop of Loctite will spread due to its high wetting power, filling the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The Loctite needs to set overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. To remove a Loctited part, it must be heated to approximately 150Â°C, which softens the adhesive, allowing the part to be pushed out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

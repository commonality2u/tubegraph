Shop presses, while not found in every small machine shop, offer a variety of useful functions if available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. They can be deceiving in appearance, as they are considered one of the most dangerous machines in a shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Safety Precautions in Presswork

The primary danger of a press stems from its ability to compress materials, storing up a significant amount of [[energy_storage_and_release_in_pressed_materials | energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Brittle Material Risk** If a brittle material like hardened steel is compressed, it can suddenly shatter, releasing all this stored [[energy_storage_and_release_in_pressed_materials | energy]] at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. For example, a block of steel compressed to near its strength limit can store more [[energy_storage_and_release_in_pressed_materials | energy]] than a bent truck spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. If 100 tons are applied and it shatters, the released [[energy_storage_and_release_in_pressed_materials | energy]] can be much greater than a rifle cartridge and can instantly kill a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Due to Poisson's ratio, forces are not just vertical but also sideways, causing pieces to fly like shrapnel in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
    *   **Rule 1: Never press a hardened or brittle piece** as it is guaranteed to shatter and poses a lethal shrapnel risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
    *   Even when pressing ductile materials, the tooling itself might be hardened, introducing a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   **Provide a Shield:** If in doubt, use a shield made of half-inch polycarbonate, which is shatter-proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Any presswork, except for sheet metal pressing, should ideally be done with a shield in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Preventing Press Damage:** Applying full force on a very small piece, like a dime or a washer, can damage the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Concentrating 100 tons on an area as small as 2 square centimeters far exceeds the yield strengths of even the best steel (50 tons per square centimeter vs. typical yield at 10-20 tons per square centimeter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This can dent or even crack the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
    *   **Rule 2: Do not apply full force on a piece with an area less than 10 square centimeters** to prevent denting or cracking the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This unintuitive concept means even pressing a small piece of plastic or wood can damage the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Applications of Shop Presses

A press is fundamentally useful for straightening and flattening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Its utility greatly expands when used in conjunction with other tools.

### [[combining_water_jet_cutting_with_presswork | Combining Water Jet Cutting with Presswork]]

The combination of a press with a water jet is highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Custom Tooling:** A water jet allows for cutting special tooling shapes from mild steel plates in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This tooling can then be used in the press to form shapes in sheet metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Lightweight, High-Performance Structures:** Presses are crucial for creating stiff, lightweight structures, particularly important for airborne applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   Stiffness in lightweight structures is best achieved using closed-form pieces, similar to how car bodies gain rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   Pressing in ribs significantly increases moment of inertia and strength compared to flat strips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
    *   For strong torsional rigidity, a closed shape is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. By pressing two ribs and spot welding around the edges, a piece with the same weight can achieve high stiffness in both bending and torsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
    *   **Materials:** Mild steel and stainless steel are common. For very high-performance structures, certain stainless steels like 17-7 stainless are ideal because they can be heat-treated after forming without quenching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This allows for pressing in an unhardened state, spot welding, and then hardening the entire piece in an oven to achieve a very high elastic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Cylindrical Boxes:** Presses are essential for making cylindrical box covers with a bent-up lip for spot welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. A water jet can simultaneously create both male and female tooling for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### Tooling and Techniques for Pressing

*   **Tooling Clearance:** When creating male and female tooling with a water jet, ensure sufficient clearance (e.g., 1.5-2 mm for 1 mm thick material) to prevent jamming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Pressing Methods for Ribs:**
    *   **Against Rubber/Lead:** A male tool can press against a very hard rubber or polyurethane (best option) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a> or lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. The rubber/lead pushes the material into the desired shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The rubber backing should be larger than the metal piece to prevent wrinkling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This method produces a nice rib but may lack sharp definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Lead can be reused by melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.
    *   **Male and Female Tooling:** For sharper definition and deep drawing, male and female tooling is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
        *   **Alignment Trick:** To align male and female tooling with sheet metal in between, first press the shape (e.g., a rib) against rubber to get a rough outline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This rough shape then serves as a guide to register and align the male and female halves before the final press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Deep Drawing:** For very deep draws or complex shapes, multiple drawing steps with annealing (heating until red hot and letting cool down) in between may be necessary to prevent tearing, similar to the stamping industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Pressing vs. Shearing:** There's a fine line between pressing and shearing. If the tooling has sharp, unrounded corners, it might shear the material instead of pressing it, especially if it's hardened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. If the intent is to punch out many parts, a hardened tool with sharp corners pressed into rubber or lead can act as a precise shear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

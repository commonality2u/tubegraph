When selecting materials for a shop or lab, a minimalist approach to plastics includes several key types, each with unique properties and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

## Polycarbonate (Lexan)
[[properties_and_uses_of_polycarbonate_in_engineering | Polycarbonate]], also known as [[properties_and_challenges_of_working_with_lexan | Lexan]], is a highly useful [[challenges_with_plastic_materials_in_prototyping | plastic material]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:05">[10:05:05]</a>.
*   **Properties**: It is completely shatter-proof, able to withstand impacts from a hammer or even a bullet, and can be bent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:10">[10:08:10]</a>. It also tolerates fairly high temperatures, at least 100°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.
*   **Applications**: It serves as a very good all-around material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:21">[10:20:21]</a>.

## Acetal (Delrin)
Acetal, commonly known by its trade name Delrin, is another excellent all-around [[challenges_with_plastic_materials_in_prototyping | plastic material]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:21">[10:25:21]</a>.
*   **Properties**: It machines the nicest of all plastics, is relatively inexpensive, and is available in various shapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:07">[10:35:07]</a>.
*   **Applications**: Maintaining a good supply of Delrin plates and rods is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

## Phenolic Laminate (G-10)
Phenolic laminate, sold under names like G-10, is a highly useful [[challenges_with_plastic_materials_in_prototyping | plastic]] that many people are less familiar with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:47">[10:48:47]</a>. It is an original plastic made from phenolic resin and layers of cotton fabric laminated together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.
*   **Properties**:
    *   Does not easily deform with heat, unlike other plastics that exhibit "creep" at temperatures well below their melting point (e.g., 70°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.
    *   Does not break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.
    *   Machines very beautifully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.
    *   Holds threads very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.
    *   Can absorb oil due to its cotton content, allowing it to self-lubricate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.
*   **Applications**:
    *   Heavily used in gears and bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
    *   A combination of a steel gear running against a phenolic gear can last indefinitely, wear-resistant, and run quieter than metal-on-metal gears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.
    *   Strong enough to make gear teeth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.

## Teflon
Teflon is another well-known [[challenges_with_plastic_materials_in_prototyping | plastic material]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.
*   **Properties**: It can withstand temperatures up to almost 200°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. However, it is a weak material, prone to cold flow, and does not hold threads well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. It possesses excellent electrical properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.
*   **Applications**: Frequently used in RF (radio frequency) work for coils or anything involving high frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. Due to its weakness, it is generally not a very useful plastic for structural components, but it can be used for lightly loaded bushings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

## PVC and ABS
PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) and ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) are inexpensive [[challenges_with_plastic_materials_in_prototyping | plastic materials]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.
*   **Properties**: Both can be glued together using a solvent-based glue, creating very strong joints, similar to how plumbers connect pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>. They are low-temperature materials, becoming quite weak at temperatures like 70°C or 80°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>. They do not hold threads, requiring inserts like Helicoil if threads are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>.
*   **Applications**: Widely available, especially in pipe forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. Ideal for constructing large, inexpensive boxes, structures, or plastic tanks when metal cannot be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>.

## Polyimide (Vespel)
Polyimide, known by the trade name Vespel (manufactured by DuPont), is an exotic and very expensive, but highly capable, [[challenges_with_plastic_materials_in_prototyping | plastic material]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>.
*   **Properties**:
    *   Highest temperature-rated polymer, with tape versions capable of withstanding up to 300°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>.
    *   Excellent electrical insulation properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>.
    *   Good cut-through resistance, preventing electrical insulation from being slowly cut by sharp corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.
    *   Holds threads very well, is very rigid, and maintains its shape without distorting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.
*   **Forms**: Available as tape, or as bulk material like rods or plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>. It can be virgin (brown) or filled with materials like carbon or MoS2 (molybdenum disulfide) to enhance its bearing properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>.
*   **Applications**: Used for parts that require high mechanical strength, electrical insulation, and resistance to high temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. A small piece can cost around $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>.

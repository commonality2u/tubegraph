Flexures are often made from materials that allow for precise, repeatable motion without wear or backlash. The choice of material significantly impacts the flexure's performance, especially concerning temperature stability and range of motion.

## Common Materials and Their Characteristics

### Sheet Metal
Sheet metal is a very accessible material for creating flexures, especially when using a water jet cutting machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12"></a>.

### Aluminum
Aluminum is often used for tutorial or demonstration flexures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09"></a>. However, it possesses significant drawbacks for high-precision applications:
*   **Temperature Sensitivity** Aluminum is very temperature sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11"></a>, with a thermal expansion coefficient of about 22-23 PPM (parts per million) per degree Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13"></a>.
*   **Stability Issues** Due to its temperature sensitivity, aluminum is not suitable for applications requiring high stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18"></a>. Radiated heat from a human hand, without physical contact, can cause an aluminum flexure to drift by 100 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37"></a>.

### Invar
For real-life flexure applications demanding high stability, Invar is a recommended material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23"></a>.

### Quartz or Other Stable Glass
Materials like quartz or other types of glass are also highly recommended for flexures requiring significant temperature stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26"></a>.

### Type 25 Beryllium Copper
This material is noted for its flexibility and ease of use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33"></a>. It can be used to create very small flexures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11"></a>.

### Steel
Standard steel has an elastic range of about 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06"></a>. This limits the travel range of flexures made from steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08"></a>.

### Nitinol (NiTinol)
Nitinol is an excellent material for flexures, particularly for parts that need to flex extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15"></a>:
*   **Elastic Range** Nitinol boasts an elastic range approximately 10 times greater than that of steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19"></a>. This allows for much larger travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43"></a>.
*   **Cost** Nitinol is an expensive material, making it impractical to cut an entire flexure block from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22"></a>. However, it can be easily used as sheet metal for the flexing components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29"></a>.
*   **Joining** Nitinol cannot be spot welded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52"></a>. Instead, each piece can be trapped between two small pieces of stainless steel, with the edges bent around to avoid sharp transitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55"></a>. Sharp transitions create stress concentration problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06"></a>.

## General Material Properties for Flexures
The range of motion for flexures is limited by the elastic range of the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01"></a>. To achieve infinite life for a flexure, it is crucial not to exceed the material's elastic range. A general rule of thumb is to use no more than two-thirds of the elastic range, and preferably stay below half, to ensure the flexure lasts forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46"></a>. The exact percentage depends on the specific metal, with some allowing 70% use and others requiring a limit of 30% for infinite life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30"></a>.

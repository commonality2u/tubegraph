Dan Gelbart's shop and lab is an attachment to his house, structured into four distinct zones to optimize workflow and maintain precision standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Shop Zones

The four zones are:
*   A high-precision area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   A general machine shop with CNC machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   A dedicated room for "dirty work" such as woodwork, sanding, grinding, and welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   A testing lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Design Philosophy

The current shop was built with a philosophy where budget was not a constraint, prioritizing an ideal shop environment from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. It incorporates significant structural elements, including 250 tons of concrete, to ensure stability and proper layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

Key design features include:
*   **Integrated Waste Management**
    *   Garbage cans are recessed into the floor, allowing for quick sweeping of debris directly into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Controlled Air Pressure System**
    *   The three separate rooms (dirty work, general machine shop, testing lab) each maintain different air pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
    *   The ventilation system is designed so the room with the most dust and humidity (the dirty work room) has the lowest air pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
    *   Conversely, the cleanest room (the testing lab) has the highest air pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
    *   This setup ensures dust and humidity are directed towards the dirty room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
    *   Doors between rooms are equipped with air filters, allowing air to flow through to the low-pressure room even when closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## Specific Areas

### High Precision Area
This area houses sensitive equipment like the Moor Number 3 jig borer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, which is accurate to about 1 micron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It also includes a granite surface plate for precise measurements and an autocollimator for optical alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Electronic gauges and air-bearing gauges are also present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. A watchmaker's lathe is kept for its specialized collets and gripping arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### General Machine Shop (CNC Area)
This zone includes CNC machines such as a Makino K55 mill and a Wirelas lathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Manual machines are also present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, including a Jet mill used primarily as a drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Dirty Work Room
This room is dedicated to operations that generate dust, heat, or fumes, such as grinding, sanding, welding, and heat-treating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. Equipment includes a Jones & Shipman surface grinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, an Omax waterjet cutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>, various sanders and grinders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>, a combination table saw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>, and a series of furnaces or ovens for heat treating and powder coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. A welding corner with a plasma needle arc welder and an induction heater are also found here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

### Testing Lab (Clean Room)
Primarily used for testing and electronic work, this room can function as a clean or semi-clean room due to its positive air pressure and air-filtered doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>. It houses a laser welder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>, a miniature spot welder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>, a homemade laser cutter and engraver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>, and a homemade diamond wire saw for cutting glass and ceramics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. The room also contains electronic test equipment, predominantly for radio frequency work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>, including spectrum analyzers and network analyzers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>.

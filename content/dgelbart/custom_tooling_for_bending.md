A press brake, also known as a brake, can be set up for a variety of bending operations, including regular bends, custom bends, and flattening, which acts as an "undo" button for incorrect bends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The custom side of the press brake is specifically designed for custom bends and tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While a digital gauge is used for setting up bends on some machines, a manual gauge is just as effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

Bending metal with a press brake requires significant pressure, and undoing a bend to perfectly flatten the metal is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. To undo a bend nicely and eliminate marks or ridges, the metal must be annealed, typically by heating it to red hot with a butane torch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Without annealing, a visible mark or ridge will remain due to work hardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Types of Custom Tools and Modifications

### Goose Neck Tool
The goose neck tool has a distinct profile, unlike the regular V-shaped tool, and is advantageous for bending narrow channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Generally, a press brake can only bend U-channels that are wider than their depth to prevent interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, a goose neck tool allows for the creation of narrow channels, such as 10x10x10 mm, by enabling the last bend to wrap around the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This is particularly useful in [[prototyping_techniques_for_creating_castinglike_structures | prototyping]] where many parts are small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Tool with a Hole for Deep Channels
A specialized tool featuring a hole is designed to create very deep U-channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This tool allows for bends where the depth is greater than the width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Homemade Tooling with Water Jet
Many custom tools, including those with holes, can be fabricated using a [[creating_custom_springs_and_minimizing_machining_using_water_jet | water jet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. To save costs, one can purchase a long bar of material and cut it into various sizes (e.g., 1-inch, 2-inch, 3-inch pieces) or a more optimized set to achieve any desired dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This is an example of [[homemade_and_diy_machine_tools | homemade and DIY machine tools]].

### Table with Marks for Narrow Strips
A useful addition to a press brake is a table with marks, which can be custom-made or purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This table aids in bending narrow strips accurately by allowing the operator to line up the material with the marks, ensuring square bends even when the strip is too narrow to touch multiple stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Die Selection for Material Thickness
The thickness of metal that can be bent depends on the width of the material and the opening of the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. A 24-ton press brake can bend full-width gauge 12 steel (just under 3 mm) using a specific die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Using a wider V-die allows for bending thicker material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. To avoid frequently changing tools, it's recommended to keep a 3/4 inch die in place, as it allows for bending quite thick material in narrow sections and 2.5 to 3 mm steel across the full width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Aluminum, being softer, allows for bending greater thicknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Front Adjustment for Non-90° Bends
Standard press brakes often have a rear adjustment for bending angles less than 90°, which can be inconvenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. A useful [[specialty_tools_and_equipment_modification | modification]] is to add a front adjustment, typically an air valve that shuts off the air when the desired depth is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This allows for easy adjustment of bend angles, such as 45°, by simply adjusting the valve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Radius Tools for Rounded Bends
To achieve a radius bend instead of a sharp one, a piece of scrap metal can be bent first and then used to provide a radius to the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. A set of radius tools is available for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. These tools often have magnets to stick to the press brake, aiding in their use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Sliding Tube Modification for Fingers
The fingers of a press brake are usually supplied narrow to allow for very narrow bends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. However, when the fingers are narrow and far apart, it can be difficult to align the part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. A very useful [[specialty_tools_and_equipment_modification | modification]] is to add a sliding tube over the finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. The original round bar is narrowed, and a sliding tube is placed over it, stopping flush with the bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This allows the finger to be narrow for close bends, while the tube provides a wider resting area for parts when far away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### Tooling for Stiffening Brackets
Brackets made from sheet metal can be flimsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Several methods can be used to add stiffness, which relate to [[bending_techniques_and_considerations_for_metal_enclosures | bending techniques and considerations for metal enclosures]] and [[designing_with_wire_and_sheet_metal | designing with wire and sheet metal]]:

*   **Simple Brace:** Bending a simple brace and [[welding_techniques_for_rods_and_various_hardware | spot welding]] it to the bracket, holding it against a square for accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Triangular Stiffener:** Bending a triangular stiffener piece with two sides, inserting it into the bracket, and [[welding_techniques_for_rods_and_various_hardware | spot welding]] it. This method doesn't require a square because the triangular piece itself is bent square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Integrated Rib:** For very simple and stiff brackets where space is limited, a rib can be bent directly into the bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This involves leaving a space between two segments on the brake and inserting a hardened steel blade with a rounded top, placed flush with the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This blade creates a rib while the main bend is made, providing immense stiffness and reducing flex in the bent part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This demonstrates the [[use_of_flexures_in_mechanical_designs | use of flexures in mechanical designs]] by adding stiffness where needed.

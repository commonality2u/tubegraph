While there is excitement about plastic 3D printing, [[metal_3d_printing_process | metal 3D printing]] is considered more important in the long run because plastics have excellent mass production methods like injection molding for high volume, quality, and low cost [00:00:22]. In contrast, mass production for high-performance metal parts like steel, stainless steel, or special alloys is difficult and costly, often relying on methods such as CNC machining, investment casting, regular casting, and forging [00:01:27], [00:02:15].

Metal 3D printing is therefore exciting because it offers both a prototyping and a production method for complex metal parts, with costs on a downward trajectory [00:02:40].

## Key Advantages and Applications

Metal 3D printing brings enormous benefits in specific scenarios, particularly when parts possess [[designing_with_wire_sheet_metal_and_solid_materials | internal features or structures]] [00:04:25].

> [!NOTE] Parts without internal structures can often be manufactured 10 times faster and cheaper using CNC machining, which works for any metal, plastic, or ceramic [00:04:41].

### Complex Geometries and Internal Structures
Parts with [[designing_with_wire_sheet_metal_and_solid_materials | internal features]] that cannot be reached by traditional tools, or have undercuts, are natural candidates for [[metal_3d_printing_process | metal 3D printing]] [00:04:58], [00:06:36].
*   **Intricate Internal Cavities**: For example, a miniature manifold with curved passages that are impossible to machine, even with EDM, or too thin-walled for regular casting [00:05:59]. While investment casting could be used, it takes weeks and significant expense [00:06:18]. Metal 3D printing can produce such parts in one to two days, making 100 parts on a single tray feasible [00:06:27].
*   **Hollow Spaces**: [[designing_with_wire_sheet_metal_and_solid_materials | Parts with internal complexity]], meaning hollow spaces, print faster and are often impossible or much slower to machine via traditional methods [00:08:46].

### Thin-Walled Structures
Parts with very thin walls are difficult and time-consuming to CNC machine because they cannot be gripped firmly, requiring very slow cuts [00:08:14]. Conversely, [[metal_3d_printing_process | metal 3D printing]] excels with thin-walled parts, as very little metal is deposited, leading to faster printing times [00:08:28].

### Exotic Alloys
When buying metal in powdered form for 3D printing, the cost of plain steel versus the best stainless steel is about the same [00:09:15]. Additionally, [[metal_3d_printing_process | 3D printing]] speed is generally consistent across different metals, unlike machining where some stainless steels are harder to work with [00:09:36]. This makes [[metal_3d_printing_process | metal 3D printing]] a natural fit for exotic alloys that would normally be challenging to machine [00:09:48].

### Combining Parts
The [[sintering_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering]] method allows for the combination of machined parts with 3D printed parts into a single piece [00:38:58]. A pre-sintered 3D printed part can be joined to a machined plate using printing paste as an adhesive, and then re-sintered [00:39:28]. After re-sintering, the parts and the paste become one solid piece of the same metal [00:39:37].

### Specific Industries and Markets
*   **High Net-Value Parts**: Laser [[metal_3d_printing_process | 3D printing]] systems, despite their high cost and extensive post-processing requirements, are very successful in making high net-value parts for industries such as medical and aerospace, often utilizing materials like titanium [00:27:15], [00:45:32].
*   **R&D, Prototyping, and Small-Batch Production**: [[Sintering in metal 3D printing | Sintering-based]] [[metal_3d_printing_process | metal 3D printing]] systems are well-suited for R&D, prototyping, educational markets, and small-batch production due to their lower cost, simplicity, and office-friendly operation [00:45:42], [00:41:24].

Even after finish machining, parts may appear precise but lack true accuracy, especially if they involve moving components that slide against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Machined parts, even those made with slow feeds and shallow finishing cuts, only touch at a few high spots when mated with another surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This leads to rapid wear and play in assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

To achieve lasting accuracy and prevent wear, surfaces must achieve a "full bearing area," meaning they touch uniformly across their entire mating surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Why Machining Isn't Enough
Machining, particularly milling, can introduce inaccuracies due to forces between the cutting tool and workpiece, and distortion from clamping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. When a clamped part is released, it can spring back, losing accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Grinding as an Intermediate Step
Surface grinding can improve accuracy over milling because it involves much smaller cutting and clamping forces, leading to less distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. However, even surface-ground parts will still only touch at a few spots when tested for flatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Lapping
Lapping is a [[techniques_for_achieving_high_accuracy_in_flexures | technique]] used to bring a surface to a full bearing area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. It is generally the easiest and fastest method for small parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Process
Lapping involves moving a part in a randomized motion on an abrasive surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
1.  **Preparation:** Clean a granite surface plate, and attach a sheet of emery cloth or paper to it, often using a drop of water to help it stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
2.  **Grit Selection:** Start with coarser grits (e.g., 180 or 220) for significant material removal, and move to finer grits (e.g., 400) for finishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
3.  **Motion:** Lap in a figure-8 motion, applying uniform pressure unless a specific corner needs correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The piece should be turned over periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
4.  **Completion:** Continue until the entire surface appears dull and all machining marks are removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### Testing Flatness
*   **Dry Erase Marker/Special Fluids:** Color the entire surface with a dry erase marker (or special flatness-detecting paints) and slide it against a very accurate granite plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Areas where the ink rubs off indicate high spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Shiny Spots:** Rubbing the surface against a reference will make high spots appear shiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Tilt the part to find these shiny areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Continued lapping will cause the shiny area to spread until the entire surface is uniformly shiny, indicating full area bearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Considerations in Lapping
*   **Rounding:** A danger in lapping is rounding the edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. For critical parts, dummy pieces can be attached to provide a wider bearing surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Material Removal:** For parts that need to fit perfectly but not slide, material in the middle can be relieved, leaving only a few contact spots or ribs to reduce lapping time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Lapping Holes and External Surfaces:**
    *   **Holes:** Use a split lap with abrasive paper wrapped around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   **External Surfaces:** Use a split external lap with emery cloth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. The part can be turned in a lathe while moving the lap back and forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Randomized Motion:** It is crucial for the lapping motion to be randomized, often by moving in two directions simultaneously, to avoid creating grooves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Shapes:** Flat surfaces, cylinders, and spheres can be easily lapped because they allow movement in two directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Shapes like threads or tapers are harder to lap effectively as they restrict motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Honing:** Honing is a related process that uses a grinding stone for a single axis, similar in [[techniques_for_achieving_high_accuracy_in_flexures | technique]] to lapping but often using a paste or liquid film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Lapping Soft Materials:** When lapping soft materials like aluminum or brass, abrasive particles can embed in the material, causing the soft material itself to act as a permanent lap, continuously wearing the harder mating part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. To prevent this, avoid pushing too hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, or use softer lapping materials or specialized compounds designed for soft materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Regular lapping compounds are generally suitable for steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## Scraping
Scraping is another [[techniques_for_achieving_high_accuracy_in_flexures | technique]] to achieve high accuracy, particularly advantageous for large structures because the part does not need to be moved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### Process
Scraping involves identifying high spots on a surface using a reference plate (like a granite plate) and then meticulously removing them with a specialized hand scraper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
1.  **Identification:** Rub the workpiece against a known flat reference surface, such as a granite plate, or use marking paste to identify high spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. High spots will show by reflection or by transferred marking.
2.  **Tool:** Use a scraper tool, often ground flat at 90 degrees or slightly less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
3.  **Removal:** Peel off a very thin layer of metal from the high spots by pushing the scraper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Work in one direction, then the other, typically at 90 degrees to previous marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
4.  **Iteration:** Repeat the process: test, identify new high spots, and scrape again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This is done many times until the high spots are uniformly spread across the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
5.  **Power Scraping:** For large areas, power scrapers (electric scrapers) can significantly speed up the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

### Scraped Surfaces
High-precision machine tools typically have a truly scraped surface with a uniform density of high spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Less precise tools may have a "fake" scraped surface where grinding marks are visible beneath an applied pattern, which may be for oil retention rather than true accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

## Benefits of Full Bearing Area
Achieving a full bearing area through lapping or scraping offers significant advantages:
*   **Accuracy:** The part sits accurately and does not "walk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Stiffness:** The part can bear a heavier load because the load is distributed over the entire surface, leading to much higher stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **Zero Wear (Hydrodynamic Lubrication):** If lubricated, two perfectly flat planes will become hydrodynamic, meaning an oil film will separate them, preventing metal-to-metal contact and resulting in zero wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This is demonstrated by hard drive spindles and computer fans, which operate without electrical contact or wear when running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Similarly, two very flat granite surfaces can float frictionlessly on an air film at very low speeds due to the low viscosity of air and the distributed load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

## Testing Accuracy Beyond Flatness
Determining the accuracy of complex geometric features like squareness, parallelism, and roundness without a perfect reference requires specialized [[techniques_for_achieving_high_accuracy_in_flexures | techniques]].

### Measuring Squareness and Parallelism
*   **Known Reference:** If a very accurate square reference (like a granite square) is available, a part can be checked against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
*   **Creating Squareness:** To make a part square to a micron or better, it can be clamped to a known square reference (e.g., a master bar accurate to sub-micron) and then ground or milled together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. Afterward, it can be lapped to achieve flatness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.
*   **Correcting Parallelism:** Small errors in parallelism can be corrected by hand lapping. If a dial gauge shows one side is higher, slight pressure can be applied to that higher side during lapping to remove more material and achieve parallelism to a micron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

### Measuring Roundness and Runout
For spindles, it's necessary to separate runout (due to mounting) from actual roundness. This can be done by using two probes at right angles to measure a perfectly round ball or cylinder mounted on the spindle. With two independent signals and two unknowns (runout and roundness), both can be determined separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

## Reversal Methods
Reversal methods are a powerful general principle in metrology for measuring accuracy (e.g., straightness, flatness, roundness) without having a perfect reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

### Principle
The core idea is to measure a feature (e.g., straightness of a surface) against an unknown reference, then reverse or invert the part and measure it again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.
1.  **First Measurement:** Take a dial gauge reading across the surface, recording deviations (f(X)) relative to the unknown reference (g(X)). The total measurement (M1) is f(X) + g(X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.
2.  **Second Measurement (Reversed):** Flip the part over and measure it again with the gauge, ensuring the same trajectory. The total measurement (M2) is now f(X) - g(X) (because the part's deviation is effectively inverted) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
3.  **Solving for Unknowns:** With two independent equations (M1 and M2) and two unknowns (f(X) and g(X)), both the straightness of the part and the reference can be resolved separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. Any tilt error from mismatched heights between measurements can be mathematically removed as it doesn't affect true straightness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

This concept extends to various precision measurements, including separating roundness from runout in spindles and ensuring accurate circle division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

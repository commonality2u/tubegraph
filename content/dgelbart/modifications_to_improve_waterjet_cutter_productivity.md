The waterjet cutter is considered a key machine for prototyping due to its versatility and precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While expensive, it can cut practically anything up to two inches thick or more, and performs cuts beautifully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. A [[comparison_of_waterjet_cutter_and_plasma_cutter | CNC plasma cutter]] can serve as a less expensive alternative, being about 1/10th the cost and operating cost, but it is less versatile, cutting only metals, and not all metals equally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

To significantly improve the productivity of a waterjet cutter, several modifications are highly desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Primary Waterjet Cutter Modifications

### Sliding Basket
The most crucial modification for a waterjet cutter is the addition of a sliding basket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. When cutting small or even large parts, they can tip over and drop into the tank, which is often full of discarded garnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Once a part falls into the tank, the chances of retrieving it are very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

A moving basket system, resting on the bottom part of the structure holding the sleds, prevents this loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The basket must be positioned about 8 inches (20 cm) below the top of the sleds to avoid being cut by the jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This basket can be moved by a pulley system, allowing for easy retrieval of lost parts and the recovery of metal slugs for other uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. For sheet metal, leaving parts hanging on a tab is an option without a basket, but this method is ineffective for materials thicker than an eighth of an inch, making the basket essential for saving time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Laser Pointer for Beam Alignment and Wear Measurement
A highly desirable modification is a method to precisely know where the waterjet beam will hit the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. A laser pointer that shines through the beam path of the jet effectively shows the exact hit spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This homemade modification involves a precisely made laser pointer that fits where the feed tube normally goes, kept clean from water by an air supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The laser spot indicates where the jet will hit the metal because it travels through the same feed tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Beyond alignment, the shape of the laser spot can also indicate the wear of the mixing tube, signaling when it needs replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This precision is especially important for resuming a job after a stop or when combining [[utilizing_waterjet_cutting_for_electronic_enclosure_precision | waterjet holes]] with pre-existing features like drill holes, requiring precise registration of the cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Splash Guard (Tennis Ball Cap)
For protection from splashes, a simple yet effective modification for the waterjet nozzle is using half of a tennis ball as a cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This improvised cap is superior to standard machine-supplied caps because it takes up very little space, allowing the jet to come very close to the edge of the material, and it can be easily flipped over to observe the cutting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Clamps
Adding clamps specifically designed for waterjet tables significantly improves efficiency. These clamps, which can be cut directly on the waterjet for quick fabrication, can tighten down material from 0 to 1 inch thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Thicker materials, typically over one inch, are usually heavy enough to not require clamping, sitting securely by their own weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Complementary Tool: Plasma Cutter for Large Objects

While not a direct modification to the waterjet cutter, owning an inexpensive plasma cutter (around $1,000 or less) can complement a waterjet in a workshop, especially for cutting holes in objects too large to fit in the waterjet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

For instance, if cutting a precise hole in a car or cabin, a template can be cut on the waterjet, allowing for the plasma cutter nozzle's diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This oversized template is then clamped to the large object, and the plasma cutter follows its contours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. To prevent electrical contact with the template and maintain proper cutting distance, it's advisable to insulate the plasma torch tip, perhaps with a machined ceramic cap or even tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. While the plasma cut is not as clean as a waterjet cut, it is acceptable for sheet metal work when done on a CNC table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Plasma cutters can cut up to quarter-inch steel (or 3/4 inch for bigger units), stainless steel, and aluminum, but not non-metallics or materials that rapidly conduct heat away like copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This method allows for efficient fabrication of custom holes in unwieldy objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

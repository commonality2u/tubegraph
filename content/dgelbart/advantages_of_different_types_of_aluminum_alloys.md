Aluminum is a versatile metal recommended for stocking in a shop or lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:52">[05:14:52]</a>.

## General Applications of Aluminum
Aluminum is suitable for:
*   Large structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:26">[05:17:26]</a>.
*   Heat sinks, as it is a good all-purpose material, though copper is better but more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

## Recommended Aluminum Alloys
### 5052 Aluminum
If stocking only one size of aluminum sheet, a gauge 10 or 12 in alloy 5052 is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:08">[05:29:08]</a>. The primary [[advantages_of_metal_3d_printing | advantage]] of 5052 aluminum is its ability to be bent without cracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:24">[05:40:24]</a>. This property is particularly useful for making heat sinks, which often require bending to increase surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:33">[05:57:33]</a>.

### 6061 Aluminum
While 6061 is a more popular alloy, it tends to crack when bent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:11">[05:46:11]</a>. This makes 5052 a preferable choice for applications requiring bending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:03">[06:03:03]</a>.

## Working with Aluminum
When machining or cutting aluminum, especially with woodworking tools, a wax stick can be used as a cutting lubricant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:40">[17:21:40]</a>. Applying wax to the blade of a table saw allows for cutting aluminum plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:34">[17:37:34]</a>. Similarly, wax can be applied to a router blade or the piece itself for routing aluminum sheets with a normal router <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:26">[17:44:26]</a>. This prevents aluminum from sticking and helps in the machining process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:07">[17:31:07]</a>.

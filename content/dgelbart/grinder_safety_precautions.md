When working with grinders, understanding specific safety precautions is crucial due to the inherent dangers of these machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Characteristics of Grinders
All types of grinders share a common characteristic: they utilize a very brittle wheel that turns at extremely high speeds, typically around 3600 RPM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Despite appearing strong, the grinding wheel is quite brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Hazards
A sharp blow to the grinding wheel while it is turning can cause it to shatter and fragments to fly off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Such shattered pieces can fly with the force of a bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Safety Rules

*   **Avoid Standing Directly in Front:** The primary rule for any grinding operation is to never stand directly in front of the grinding wheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Optimal Standing Position:** When grinding, always stand to the side of the wheel, never straight in front of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Expect Shattering:** Be aware that a grinding wheel is likely to shatter at least once during a person's lifetime of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

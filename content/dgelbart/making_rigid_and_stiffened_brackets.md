Brackets are common components in many designs, but a simple right-angle bend can result in a flimsy structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Several techniques can be employed to make brackets more rigid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Stiffening Techniques

### 1. Adding a Bent Brace

The simplest method to stiffen a bracket is by adding a bent brace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

*   Bend a separate piece of material to create a brace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   Hold the main bracket against a square to ensure accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   [[techniques_for_building_temporary_and_rigid_structures_with_adhesive_bonding|Spot weld]] the brace to the bracket while holding it square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

### 2. Using a Triangular Stiffener

A second approach involves using a triangular stiffener piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

*   Bend the two sides of a triangular piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   Insert the triangular piece into the bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   [[techniques_for_building_temporary_and_rigid_structures_with_adhesive_bonding|Spot weld]] it in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   This method generally does not require a separate square for alignment, as the triangular piece itself is bent square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### 3. Bending an Integral Rib

For situations where space is limited or a simpler, stiffer bracket is desired, an integral rib can be bent directly into the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This technique provides immense [[strength_versus_stiffness_in_mechanical_design|stiffness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

#### Procedure for Bending a Rib

1.  **Tool Setup:**
    *   Leave a space on the press brake between two segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
    *   It is beneficial to minutely round the corner of the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
    *   Insert a hardened steel blade with a rounded top into this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The blade must be hardened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
    *   Position the blade to be about flush with the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

2.  **Bending:**
    *   As the bend is made, the hardened blade simultaneously forms a rib in the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

This rib significantly increases the bracket's [[strength_versus_stiffness_in_mechanical_design|stiffness]], with most flex occurring in any unstiffened parts rather than the ribbed section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

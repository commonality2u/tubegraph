Flexures are easily manufactured, especially with a water jet and sheet metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. They offer several significant advantages over traditional mechanical slides and pivot methods.

## Key Advantages

### Maintenance and Durability
A primary advantage of flexures over traditional mechanical slides is that they require no lubrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This makes them suitable for dirty environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, eliminating the need to worry about maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Furthermore, flexures experience no wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, contributing to an infinite life if designed correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Precision and Reliability
Flexures inherently provide no backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Unlike traditional stages that may require preload adjustments and can develop looseness over time due to wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, flexures will never develop any play or looseness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. For example, a linear stage flexure can be precisely moved 10 nanometers at a time without backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Cost-Effectiveness and Integration
A significant benefit of flexures is their low cost of fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. If you have access to a water jet, all that is needed is a piece of scrap metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This means a flexure that might cost hundreds of dollars if purchased can be made for virtually free, often in about 5 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. They can also be incorporated directly into existing designs as integral flexures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This makes them highly beneficial for research and development (R&D) and for students, allowing for the creation of many prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Design Considerations for Infinite Life
To ensure infinite life for flexures, it is crucial not to use up the material's entire elastic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The elastic range refers to the deformation limit beyond which the material will not return to its original shape and will remain permanently deformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

For most metals, it's recommended to utilize no more than about two-thirds of the elastic range, and preferably stay below half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. The exact percentage can vary; some metals allow for 70% of the elastic range, while others should not exceed 30% for infinite life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. If this rule is followed, the flexure will last forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

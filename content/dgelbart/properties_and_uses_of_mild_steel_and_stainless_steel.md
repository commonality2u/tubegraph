## Mild Steel
Cold-rolled mild steel sheets are a fundamental material for a shop or lab due to their strength, affordability, and widespread availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It is easily [[material_compatibility_with_spot_welding | spot welded]] and works well with [[techniques_for_bending_metal | bending]] and waterjet cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Recommended Stock Sizes
For a minimalistic approach, stocking two thicknesses of cold-rolled mild steel sheet is recommended:
*   **Gauge 18**: Approximately 1.2 mm thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Gauge 10**: Slightly over 3 mm thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

These two gauges can cover about 95% of building needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The heavier gauge 10 is used for making brackets, bases, and massive assemblies, while other components can be made from gauge 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Free-Machining Steel
When stocking steel bars and rods, it is advised to purchase the free-machining type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This type, achieved by adding elements like lead or sulfur, significantly reduces machining time and improves surface finish, outweighing the slightly higher material cost for single parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Stainless Steel
Stainless steel is another essential material, though more expensive than mild steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Recommended Stock Sizes
A basic stock should include a 300 series stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Given its cost, gauge 18 and gauge 12 are recommended, rather than gauge 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Types and Properties
Stainless steel comes in 300 and 400 series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **300 Series (e.g., Type 301 full hard)**: This series, especially in spring temper, can be sheared and [[techniques_for_bending_metal | bent]] without breaking, even though it is [[materials_used_for_flexures_and_their_properties | springy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. It is suitable for general-purpose [[materials_used_for_flexures_and_their_properties | spring]] applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Ends of rolls from suppliers like sitecuts.com can provide cost-effective material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **400 Series**: While available in spring temper, the 400 series is harder and cannot be easily sheared or [[techniques_for_bending_metal | bent]], making it more complicated to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **17-7 Stainless Steel**: This type comes in an annealed (soft) state, allowing for forming, [[techniques_for_bending_metal | bending]], and [[material_compatibility_with_spot_welding | spot welding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. After a specific heat-treating cycle (typically heating to 760°C, cooling, then reheating to 580°C), it becomes very hard and [[materials_used_for_flexures_and_their_properties | springy]], making it one of the strongest and [[materials_used_for_flexures_and_their_properties | springiest]] stainless steels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This allows parts to be formed in a malleable state and then hardened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
    *   **17-7 [[materials_used_for_flexures_and_their_properties | Spring Wire]]**: This wire only requires one heating cycle (e.g., 480°C for 1 hour) after winding into a [[materials_used_for_flexures_and_their_properties | spring]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Free-Machining Stainless Steel
Similar to steel, choosing free-machining stainless steel bars and rods is beneficial for reducing machining time and improving surface finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Hardenable Stainless Steel (440 Series)
The 440 series stainless steel is a hardenable type useful for applications like surgical tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. While not as corrosion-resistant as the 300 series, it hardens similarly to A2 steel by heating and fast cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

### Spark Testing for Identification
Different steel types produce distinct spark patterns when ground, which can be used for identification:
*   **Mild Steel**: Produces very few sparks with no star at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
*   **Carbon Steel**: Produces many more sparks with a star at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
*   **A2 Steel**: Produces darker, dimmer sparks with no star <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
*   **High-Speed Steel**: Produces very dark, reddish sparks with almost no stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.
*   **440 Stainless Steel**: Produces almost no sparks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

### Hardening and Tempering Steel
*   **Hardening**: A2 steel is an air-hardening steel, meaning it hardens by heating it to white hot (around 950°C) and allowing it to cool in air, without the need for quenching, which reduces distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. A2 also exhibits very low dimensional change after hardening, allowing for near net-shape machining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. To prevent decarburization of the surface during heating, the steel can be wrapped in paper and then sealed in stainless foil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. A torch can be used for hardening small pieces by heating to white hot on a thermal insulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
*   **Tempering**: After hardening, steel is brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. Tempering is a secondary heat treatment that trades off some hardness for increased toughness, preventing shattering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>. This involves heating the hardened steel between 250°C and 300°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
    *   **Temperature by Color**: Steel changes color within this range, allowing for visual estimation of temperature:
        *   **Straw color** (approx. 220°C): Results in Rockwell C 60 hardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.
        *   **Dark blue** (approx. 270°C): Results in Rockwell C 56-55 hardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.
        *   **Light blue** (approx. 300°C): Provides better toughness but lower hardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.
    *   When tempering with a torch, use a small flame and continuously move it to prevent overheating a single spot, especially on asymmetrical parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.

### Making Custom Cutting Tools
A piece of carbide from a discarded insert can be brazed onto a mild steel stem to create custom cutting tools or special-sized drills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

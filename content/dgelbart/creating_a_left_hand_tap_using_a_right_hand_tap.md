In situations where a left-hand tap is required but unavailable, an emergency left-hand tap can be fashioned from a standard right-hand tap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This method involves modifying a right-hand tap and reversing the drill press direction to cut a left-hand thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Modification Process

1.  **Grinding Flat:** Take a right-hand tap and grind it flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This should leave only a section in the middle, approximately one-third of the tap's original diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  **Adding Rake Angle Grooves:** For improved tapping performance, grind two grooves into the flattened section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. These grooves provide a rake angle to the cutting edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. A hand grinder can be used for this step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Although the tap remains a right-hand tap by design, its narrow lands (the flat sections) allow it to function as a left-hand tap when used correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This is an example of a [[homemade_and_diy_machine_tools | homemade and DIY machine tool]] solution.

## Tapping a Left-Hand Thread

1.  **Pre-Drill the Hole:** First, drill the necessary hole in the workpiece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
2.  **Insert Tap and Apply Cutting Fluid:** Insert the modified tap into the drilled hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a> and apply cutting fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
3.  **Reverse Drill Press Direction:** Crucially, operate the drill press in reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Instead of the usual forward rotation, run the drill backwards to cut a left-hand thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

This technique results in a perfect left-hand thread cut with a right-hand tap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

For prototyping, the key machine identified is a [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | water jet cutter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Specifically, an OMEX 2654 [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | water jet cutter]] is mentioned as the primary expensive piece of equipment needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Waterjet Cutter vs. Plasma Cutter

While a [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | water jet cutter]] is ideal for its versatility and precision, a CNC [[comparison_of_waterjet_cutter_and_plasma_cutter | plasma cutter]] (like those made by Torch Mate) can serve as a less expensive alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

> [!INFO] Cost and Versatility Comparison
> A [[comparison_of_waterjet_cutter_and_plasma_cutter | plasma cutter]] is about 1/10th the cost and 1/10th the operating cost of a [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | water jet cutter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. However, a [[comparison_of_waterjet_cutter_and_plasma_cutter | plasma cutter]] is much less versatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It cuts less effectively, can only cut metals, and does not cut all metals equally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
>
> In contrast, a [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | water jet]] can cut virtually anything up to 2 inches (or more) in thickness and provides a beautiful cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Despite budget constraints, many tasks performed by a [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | water jet]] can also be achieved with a CNC [[comparison_of_waterjet_cutter_and_plasma_cutter | plasma cutter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Modifications for Productivity

To [[modifications_to_improve_waterjet_cutter_productivity | improve productivity]] on a [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | water jet cutter]], several [[modifications_to_improve_waterjet_cutter_productivity | modifications]] are recommended:

### 1. Sliding Basket
Adding a sliding basket is the most important [[modifications_to_improve_waterjet_cutter_productivity | modification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Small parts, and sometimes even large ones, can drop into the tank full of discarded garnet and become lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Retrieving them from the tank is very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Design**: The basket rests on the bottom part of the U-beam that holds the sleds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. It needs to be about 8 inches (20 cm) below the top of the sleds to avoid being cut by the jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Operation**: The basket can be moved by a pulley, allowing it to be picked up and taken out to retrieve lost parts or reusable metal slugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. It simply sits on a cradle and can be dropped in and moved back into position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Necessity**: For material thicker than approximately 1/8th of an inch, the method of leaving parts hanging on a tab and breaking them off does not work, making the basket essential to save time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### 2. Laser Pointer for Beam Alignment
A [[using_laser_pointers_for_precision_in_waterjet_cutting | laser pointer]] is highly desirable to know exactly where the beam will hit the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Function**: A [[using_laser_pointers_for_precision_in_waterjet_cutting | laser pointer]] shines through the beam path of the jet, showing the exact spot where the jet will hit because it passes through the same feed tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Integration**: It can be a homemade device that fits precisely where the feed tube goes, and an air supply can be plugged in to keep the nozzle clean from water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Additional Benefits**:
    *   **Wear Measurement**: The shape of the [[using_laser_pointers_for_precision_in_waterjet_cutting | laser pointer]] spot can indicate wear in the mixing tube, signaling when it needs replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   **Job Resumption**: It is particularly important for aligning the beam when a job has been stopped and needs to be restarted from where it left off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
    *   **Precision Registration**: Useful when mixing precision holes with [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | water jet]] holes, allowing cutting to be registered to pre-existing features like bolt holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### 3. Tennis Ball Splash Guard
A cap is needed to guard from splashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Half of a tennis ball is found to be more effective than supplied caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. It takes up little space, allowing cuts very close to the edge, and can be easily flipped over to observe the cutting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### 4. Clamps
Adding clamps, such as those cut on the [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | water jet]] itself, is a good [[modifications_to_improve_waterjet_cutter_productivity | modification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. These clamps can tighten down on material from 0 to 1 inch thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Thicker materials (over 1 inch) are typically heavy enough not to require clamping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Plasma Cutter: Complementary Tool for Prototyping

An air [[applications_of_plasma_cutters | plasma cutter]] is an inexpensive and useful tool, costing around $1,000 or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. While not replacing a [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | water jet]], it complements it for specific tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Use Cases and Features
*   **Portability**: It is very light and only requires compressed air and household power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Large Workpieces**: Ideal for [[utilizing_waterjet_cutting_for_electronic_enclosure_precision | cutting a hole in a box or an enclosure]] that is too large to fit into a [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | water jet]], such as parts of a car or cabin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Template Use**: A template can be cut on the [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | water jet]] (allowing for the nozzle diameter), clamped to the workpiece, and then followed with the [[applications_of_plasma_cutters | plasma cutter]] to cut a well-defined hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
    *   It is advisable to insulate the [[applications_of_plasma_cutters | plasma cutter]] tip (e.g., with a ceramic cap or tape) to prevent electrical contact with the template and maintain a small distance from the material being cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Cut Quality**: While manual cuts may not be perfectly steady, if the [[applications_of_plasma_cutters | plasma cutter]] torch is mounted on a CNC table, the cut quality is quite good and acceptable for sheet metal work, though not as precise as a [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | water jet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### Limitations
*   **Material Compatibility**: A [[applications_of_plasma_cutters | plasma cutter]] will cut steel (up to 1/4 inch for smaller units, 3/4 inch for bigger ones), stainless steel, and aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   It **will not cut non-metallic materials** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   It performs poorly on materials that conduct heat away very quickly, such as copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Safety Considerations
> When using a [[applications_of_plasma_cutters | plasma cutter]], it is crucial to wear goggles for eye protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This is not only for sparks but also due to the intense UV light emitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Additionally, do not have flammable materials like butane bottles nearby when sparks are being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

A press, while not found in every small shop, offers numerous useful applications, particularly when fabricating high-performance and lightweight structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Safety Precautions

A press is considered one of the most dangerous machines in a shop due to the immense energy stored when compressing materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Danger of Brittle Materials
If a brittle material, such as hardened steel, is compressed, it can suddenly shatter, releasing all stored energy at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This release can be more powerful than a rifle cartridge and can instantly kill a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Due to the Poisson ratio, forces are not just vertical but also sideways, causing pieces to fly like shrapnel in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Rule**: Never press a hardened or brittle piece of material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   Even when pressing ductile materials, the tooling itself might be hardened, posing a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Shielding
The best [[safety_precautions_when_using_a_press | safety precaution]] for press work, except for pressing sheet metal, is to use a shield made of half-inch polycarbonate, which is shatterproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Protecting the Press
Applying full press force onto a very small area can damage the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. For example, concentrating 100 tons on 2 square centimeters exceeds the yield strength of even the best steel (most steels yield around 10-20 tons per square centimeter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Rule**: If a press is 100 tons, do not apply full force to an area less than 10 square centimeters to avoid denting or cracking the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This applies even when pressing soft materials like plastic or wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Carelessly pressing a piece of hardened steel is "guaranteed to shatter," and whether the shrapnel causes injury or death is "just a matter of luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Always be well aware of these dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Press and Water Jet Combination
A press, while useful for straightening and flattening on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, becomes a powerful tool when combined with a water jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This allows for quick and efficient [[customization_and_tooling_for_precision_bending | cutting of tooling]] from mild steel plates in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This method is significantly faster than using a CNC mill for complex patterns because it eliminates clamping and complex setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Achieving Stiffness in Lightweight Structures
The press is particularly important for making [[design_considerations_for_lightweight_structures | high-performance, lightweight structures]], especially for aerospace applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Closed Form Pieces
The best way to achieve stiffness in lightweight structures is by using closed-form pieces, similar to how a car gains its rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   A flat strip of metal, even if thick, lacks rigidity and can be easily bent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   Pressing in a rib significantly increases the moment of inertia and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   While bending a piece (e.g., into an L-shape) provides strength in one direction, it lacks torsional strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   To achieve torsional strength, a closed shape is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   By pressing two ribs and [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | spot welding]] them together, a piece can have the same weight but be stiff in both bending and torsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Material Selection
For high-performance structures, certain stainless steels that can be heat-treated after forming are ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Examples include 17-7 stainless steel, which hardens through simple heat treatment cycles without needing quenching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   The process involves pressing the shape, [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | spot welding]] it, and then putting the entire piece in an oven for a temperature cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   This results in a material with a very high elastic range that springs back after bending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   For normal structures, powder-coated steel is suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Pressing Techniques and Examples

### Creating Tooling with a Water Jet
The water jet is instrumental for making [[customization_and_tooling_for_precision_bending | custom tooling]].
*   For example, to reinforce a lightweight box cover, two layers can be cut on the water jet: one with tabs (X-shape) and a backing layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. These are then [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | spot welded]] together, and a piece of metal is placed over them to press the desired shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Forming Cylindrical Boxes
To make cylindrical boxes with lips for welding, a set of male and female tooling can be cut with a water jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   Crucially, the clearance between male and female parts should be greater than the material thickness (e.g., 1.5mm or 2mm clearance for 1mm thick material) to prevent jamming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   After pressing, the ugly edges can be sanded for a clean disc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Aligning Male and Female Dies
A significant challenge in pressing with male and female dies is alignment, especially with sheet metal in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Misplacement can ruin both the tool and the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Stiffening with Ribs: Two Methods

#### 1. Pressing Against Rubber/Lead
One method involves pressing a male tool against a hard rubber or very hard polyurethane backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. For very sharp definition, lead can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   The rubber/polyurethane must be larger than the metal piece being pressed to prevent wrinkling of edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   This method produces a nice rib but may lack sharp definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   To minimize bending the press, position the material in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   For sheet metal, a shield is typically not required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

#### 2. Pressing with Male and Female Dies
Once a rough shape with a rib is formed (e.g., by pressing against rubber), it can be used to register and align the male and female dies for a much sharper definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   The pre-formed shape provides a groove for accurate alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   This method is necessary for deep draws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

### Deep Drawing
For deep drawing complex shapes, it may be necessary to perform multiple draws with annealing in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   Annealing involves heating the metal until it's red hot and then letting it cool down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   For example, a very deep draw might require a first draw with a half-inch thick die, then annealing, and finally a second draw with a 1-inch thick die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This prevents the material from tearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

### Shearing vs. Pressing
If the tooling has sharp, unrounded corners and is pressed into a soft material like lead, it can shear the material rather than just pressing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   To intentionally shear a part, the male tool should be hardened with sharp corners and pressed into rubber or lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. This is useful for punching out many identical parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   The difference between pressing and shearing depends on the sharpness of the tooling's edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

A [[cnc_plasma_cutter_as_an_alternative | CNC plasma cutter]] offers a versatile and cost-effective alternative to a water jet cutter, especially for certain applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While a water jet is more precise and can cut a wider range of materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, a plasma cutter can achieve similar results for many tasks at a fraction of the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Plasma Cutter Overview

A plasma cutter is a portable and lightweight unit that requires only compressed air and standard household power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It is relatively inexpensive, often costing around $1,000 or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Cutting Capabilities
Plasma cutters can cut up to 1/4 inch steel, with larger models capable of cutting up to 3/4 inch steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. They are effective on stainless steel and aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### Limitations
Plasma cutters cannot cut non-metallic materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. They also struggle with materials that conduct heat away very quickly, such as copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. While the cut quality is not as refined as a water jet, it is "completely acceptable for [[designing_with_wire_and_sheet_metal | sheet metal work]]" when the torch is mounted on a CNC table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Template Cutting Process

Template cutting with a plasma cutter is particularly useful for creating well-defined holes in large objects, such as car bodies or [[designing_enclosures_using_waterjet_cutting | enclosures]], that are too large to fit into a [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]] machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

1.  **Template Creation**: An "oversized" template is cut on a [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. The template must be oversized to account for the diameter of the plasma cutter's nozzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
2.  **Clamping**: The template is then clamped securely to the workpiece (e.g., cabinet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
3.  **Insulation**: It is advisable to insulate the plasma cutter's tip to prevent it from electrically touching the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. A machined ceramic cap is ideal, but wrapping electrical tape around the tip can serve as a temporary solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
4.  **Cutting**: Maintain a small distance from the material while following the template with the plasma cutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The plasma cutter transfers an internal arc to the workpiece for cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Ensure the workpiece is properly grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## [[safety_considerations_when_using_cutting_equipment | Safety Considerations]]

When using a plasma cutter, it is crucial to wear appropriate [[safety_considerations_when_using_cutting_equipment | safety goggles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. These goggles protect not only from sparks but also from the intense UV light emitted by the plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Ensure the goggles are UV filtered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Additionally, avoid having flammable materials, such as butane bottles, near the cutting area where sparks will be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

This course focuses on building things rapidly, primarily for students, scientists, and researchers who are not trained machinists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The emphasis is on quickly fabricating items using easily mastered equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While applicable to limited production, its biggest benefit is for [[prototyping_using_water_jet_cutting | prototyping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The core enabling technology for this simplified approach is [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet cutting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Fabricating Custom Springs with Water Jet

[[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | Water jet cutting]] is highly effective for fabricating various types of springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Carved Springs from Solid Materials
Springs can be carved directly from solid steel, even hard material, or cut in an annealed state and then hardened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This method allows for the creation of springs requiring several hundred kilograms to compress, which would be very difficult to wind from thick wire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Disc Springs with Spirals
[[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | Water jet cutting]] also enables the creation of precise disc springs with spirals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Minimal Clearance:** These disc springs can compress completely flat, reducing to the material's thickness, which ensures minimum clearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Programmable K-Function:** Unlike traditional springs, these don't have to be constant K (spring rate) springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. A spiral with a constant width will naturally have a progressive K because the outer spiral deflects more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. By linearly tapering the spiral, a constant K can be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This flexibility allows for converting any desired force-versus-distance plot into a spring design, effectively creating an arbitrary K function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This is particularly useful for springs needing a wide dynamic range, responding to slight pressure but also holding significant pressure before bottoming out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The ability to program the K-function continuously as a function of distance at the same cost as a regular spring is a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Flexures as Springs
[[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | Water jet cutting]] is also well-suited for creating flexures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Flexures can be monolithic, acting as very small, precise positioners (e.g., a four-axis positioner for fiber optics providing X, Y, TA, and FE tilt movements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. They can also be made from spring material like sheet metal, with spot-welded springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Nitinol, a shape memory alloy, can be used for springs in cross spring hinges to achieve a very large elastic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

The advantages of flexures over traditional slides include:
*   No wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>
*   No lubrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
*   No backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
*   Significantly lower cost and faster fabrication compared to buying commercial slides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>

## Minimizing Machining Operations

A key benefit of [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet cutting]] is its ability to minimize subsequent machining operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Strategic Finishing for Accuracy
For parts requiring accuracy beyond the [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet's]] inherent precision, the part is initially [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]] cut entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The recommended process is to:
1.  [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | Water jet]] cut the entire part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
2.  Paint it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
3.  Clamp it in a vise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
4.  Touch up the critical surfaces after painting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

This method is much faster than traditional approaches that involve masking precision surfaces before painting and then cleaning up leftover paint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The paint, being tough enough to withstand clamping, allows for efficient post-processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. An example shows a part where 95% of the work is done by [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]], with only 5% of the rim machined afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Complex Assemblies from Simple Water Jet Parts
Even complex assemblies can be broken down into simple structures that are primarily [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]] cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. An example is a gearbox rotating on two axes, which is constructed like simple [[designing_enclosures_using_waterjet_cutting | enclosures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Bearing mounts are small inserts attached with screws to the housing for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The gearing inside can be achieved with timing belts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

A chuck designed to grip at different diameters appears to be a completely machined item, but it contains no machined parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   Everything is made from [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]] cut parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   A pipe and a ring are pressed together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   The internal scroll that activates the arms is a [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]] cut helix into which a flexible steel strip is inserted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This method saves significant work compared to machining, hardening, and CNC grinding a single steel piece for accuracy and wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

When designing parts, using [[waterjet_cutter_usage_and_benefits | water jet]] cut components that can be spot-welded, bent, and then machined in localized thicker sections simplifies complex fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This approach makes intricate [[materials_and_construction_methods_for_precision_machinery | precision machinery]] accessible for fabrication even for those not trained as machinists.

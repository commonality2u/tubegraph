The goose neck tool is a specialized piece of [[custom_tooling_for_bending | custom tooling]] used with a press brake, offering distinct advantages over a regular V-tool, especially in [[Prototyping techniques for creating castinglike structures | prototyping]] applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Description and Profile
Unlike a regular tool which typically has a V-profile at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, the goose neck tool features a specific profile that allows it to wrap around a bend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Advantages in Bending
The primary advantage of using a goose neck tool is its ability to bend narrow channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Standard press brakes generally limit U-bends to widths greater than their depths, as interference would otherwise occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. With a goose neck tool, it's possible to create narrower channels, such as 10x10x10 mm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Prototyping Applications
In [[Prototyping techniques for creating castinglike structures | prototyping]], where many parts tend to be small, the goose neck tool is highly preferable due to its capability to form these narrow channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Deep Channel Bending
A variation of the goose neck tool, specifically one with a hole, allows for the bending of very deep U-shapes, even those where the depth exceeds the width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Tooling and Fabrication
These tools can be self-made. A common method is to purchase a long bar of material and then cut it into various lengths (e.g., 1-inch, 2-inch, 3-inch pieces) using a [[prototyping_using_water_jet_cutting | water jet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This allows for the creation of a minimum number of pieces to achieve any desired dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, including specialized pieces like the one with a hole for deeper bends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

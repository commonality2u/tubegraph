This article outlines techniques for building various structures quickly and easily, primarily for students, scientists, and researchers who are not trained machinists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The methods are applicable for both prototyping and limited production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The core enabling technology for these [[techniques_for_achieving_high_accuracy_in_flexures | techniques]] is water jet cutting, which significantly simplifies the fabrication process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## [[Design and Preparation of Sheet Metal Enclosures | Enclosure Design and Construction]]

[[Design and Preparation of Sheet Metal Enclosures | Enclosures]] are a common application for water jet cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. When designing for R&D work, it's beneficial to incorporate specific features to simplify assembly and maintenance:

*   **Captive Hardware** Parts should ideally be designed with all captive hardware, meaning no screws hold the cover, which instead snaps into place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Knockouts** Incorporate knockouts, similar to electrical boxes, to avoid the need for later drilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Keyholes** Utilize keyholes instead of regular holes wherever possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This is a significant time-saver as screws don't need to be fully removed, and it prevents the common issue of screws falling into the machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Embossing** For [[techniques_for_building_temporary_and_rigid_structures_with_adhesive_bonding | lightweight]] and strong parts, embossing can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Ribs can be quickly created using a dye made on the water jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **U-shaped Pieces** A preferred [[bending_order_and_techniques_for_enclosure_assembly | design approach]] is to construct [[design_and_preparation_of_sheet_metal_enclosures | enclosures]] from U-shaped pieces rather than bending a single piece on all four sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This allows [[techniques_for_bending_metal | bending]] on a brake press without needing to adjust segments, which saves time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Minimizing Machining** To achieve high accuracy beyond the water jet's capability, parts can be water jet cut, painted, clamped, and then touched up on a machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This method is faster than traditional masking and cleaning processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Complex Assemblies from Simple Parts** Even complex structures, like a gearbox, can be broken down into simple [[design_and_preparation_of_sheet_metal_enclosures | enclosures]] and sub-assemblies made from spot-welded bent metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Thicker sections can be added or welded on and machined afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Example: Water Jet Cut Chuck

A chuck designed for gripping at different diameters appears fully machined but is entirely made from water jet cut parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This includes a pipe and ring pressed together, and even the internal scroll that activates the arms is a water jet cut helix with a flexible steel strip inserted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This approach leverages the pre-hardened and smooth nature of the inserted spring, avoiding extensive machining, hardening, and grinding that would be required for a single-piece component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## [[Types of flexures and their design | Flexure Design and Construction]]

[[Types of flexures and their design | Flexures]] are a natural application for water jet cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Types of Flexures
[[Types of flexures and their design | Flexures]] can be:
*   **Monolithic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Tiny** Very small flexures can be made, such as a 4-axis positioner (X, Y, TA, FE tilt) for fiber optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **From Spring Material** They can be constructed from [[materials_used_for_flexures_and_their_properties | spring material]] or [[materials_used_for_flexures_and_their_properties | sheet metal]], with spot-welded springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Nitinal Springs** [[Materials used for flexures and their properties | Nitinal]] can be used for springs to achieve a very large elastic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Cross Spring Hinges** These act like normal hinges but are entirely spot-welded with [[materials_used_for_flexures_and_their_properties | Nitinal]] flexures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### [[Benefits of using flexures over traditional methods | Advantages of Flexures]]
Compared to traditional slides, [[benefits_of_using_flexures_over_traditional_methods | flexures offer several advantages]]:
*   No wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>
*   No lubrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>
*   No backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>
*   Can be made quickly and at significantly lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>

### Water Jet Cut Springs
Water jet cutting is effective for fabricating springs:
*   **Solid Steel Springs** Springs can be carved from solid steel, cut either from hardened or annealed material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. These can withstand hundreds of kilos of compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Disc Springs with Spiral** These springs are designed with a spiral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   **Minimum Clearance** They can compress completely flat, reducing to the material's thickness, which allows for minimum clearance in designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
    *   **Programmable K-Function** Unlike constant K (spring constant) springs, water jet cut spiral springs can be designed to have an arbitrary K function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. A constant width spiral will result in a progressive K (spring constant) because the outer spiral deflects more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. To achieve a constant K, the spiral can be linearly tapered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This capability allows for springs with a very wide dynamic range, suitable for various pressure requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

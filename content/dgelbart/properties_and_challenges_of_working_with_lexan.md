Lexan is a material that presents specific [[challenges_with_plastic_materials_in_prototyping | challenges]] when used in processes like vacuum forming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Characteristics of Lexan

*   **Difficulty in Softening** Lexan does not soften easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, making it a [[challenges_with_plastic_materials_in_prototyping | difficult material for vacuum forming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Rapid Hardening** As soon as Lexan cools down even slightly, it becomes hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Strength** A significant advantage of Lexan is its strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Shatterproof** Lexan is shatterproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Heat Retention vs. Hardness** Unlike normal [[characteristics_and_applications_of_various_plastics | plastics]] that stay soft for a long time when hot, Lexan can be very hot but already hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Challenges in Vacuum Forming

Due to its characteristic of not softening easily and hardening quickly upon cooling, Lexan does not pull down all the way during vacuum forming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This contrasts with other [[characteristics_and_applications_of_various_plastics | plastics]] like PVC, ABS, or polyethylene, which form beautifully and pull down completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

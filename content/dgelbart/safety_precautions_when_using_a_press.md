A press, while useful for various tasks, is considered one of the most [[safety_rules_in_workshops | dangerous]] machines in a workshop due to its deceiving appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Dangers of Press Operation

The primary danger of a press stems from its ability to store immense energy when compressing a piece of steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. If the material being pressed is [[dangers_of_grinder_machines_and_brittle_wheels | brittle]], it can suddenly shatter, releasing all this stored energy at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. A block of steel compressed to near its strength limit can store more energy than a bent truck spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Such a shattering event can release energy comparable to a rifle cartridge, capable of instantly killing a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

When steel shatters under pressure, forces are not only vertical but also sideways, causing pieces to fly like shrapnel in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Even when compressing ductile materials, there's a risk if the tooling or the press itself is hardened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Another significant danger is damaging the press itself by concentrating too much force on a small area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For example, applying 100 tons of force on an area the size of a dime (approx. 2 square cm) will exceed the yield strength of the best steel, causing a dent or even a crack in the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Essential Safety Rules

*   **Never Press Hardened or Brittle Materials**: The first and most crucial rule is to never press a hardened or [[dangers_of_grinder_machines_and_brittle_wheels | brittle]] piece, as it will store energy and explode like a hand grenade if it shatters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Pressing hardened steel is guaranteed to shatter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Use a Protective Shield**: Always provide a shield made of half-inch polycarbonate. Polycarbonate is shatterproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Anything other than pressing sheet metal should be done with a shield in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Avoid Concentrated Force**: Do not apply the full force of the press to an area less than 10 square cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This prevents damage to the press itself, such as denting or cracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Center the Workpiece**: When pressing, it's important to put the workpiece in the middle of the press to avoid bending or damaging the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, especially with sheet metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Tooling Alignment**: When using male and female tooling, precise alignment is critical to avoid ruining the tool and the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Pressing Techniques

*   **Against Rubber/Lead**: One method of pressing is to use a male tool against hard rubber or polyurethane to push in the shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. For very sharp definitions, pressing against lead can be used, and the lead can be reused by melting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **Male and Female Tooling**: For sharper definitions, use male and female tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. If performing a deep draw, the material may need to be annealed (heated to red hot and cooled) between draws to prevent tearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Alignment Trick**: To align male and female tooling with a sheet metal workpiece, first press the material with a male tool against rubber to create a rough shape. This rough shape will then allow for proper alignment of the male and female dies for an accurate press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Applications of a Press

*   **Straightening and Flattening**: A press is primarily useful for straightening and flattening materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Combination with Water Jet**: A press combined with a water jet is a powerful duo. The water jet can quickly cut custom tooling from mild steel plates in minutes, which can then be used in the press to form shapes in sheet metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Creating [[creating_lightweight_structures_with_a_press | Lightweight Structures]]**: Presses are essential for creating [[creating_lightweight_structures_with_a_press | lightweight]], high-performance structures by forming closed-form pieces with ribs, similar to how car bodies achieve rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Pressed ribs significantly increase stiffness in bending and torsion without adding substantial weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Cylindrical Boxes**: Presses are used to create cylindrical boxes and drum covers with bent lips for spot welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Tooling for this can be cut with a water jet, ensuring proper clearance for the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Punching/Shearing**: With hardened tooling and sharp corners, a press can be used to punch out parts, which is efficient for producing many identical pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

For high-performance structures, certain stainless steels like 17-7 stainless are ideal because they can be heat-treated after forming to achieve a very high elastic range, allowing the material to spring back after bending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## The Dawn of Rapid Communication

In the mid-19th century, before the advent of telegraphy, communication across vast distances, such as between England and the United States, could take a month for a single exchange of letters via sailboat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. This slow pace hindered rapid business and personal interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. While telegraphy was already widespread overland within countries, starting around 1840, an intercontinental connection between Europe and the U.S. was lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.

## The Transatlantic Cable

The monumental task of laying the first transatlantic cable was largely attributed to Cyrus Field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. However, the eventual success of the cable's operation was due to Oliver Heaviside, who understood why the initial cable failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.

The first transatlantic cable was a revolutionary endeavor, with commemorative pieces of the cable, complete with certificates signed by Cyrus Field, sold by Tiffany to mark its successful laying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.

### Challenges and Backup Plans

Many people doubted that a cable could be successfully laid across the ocean, and they were nearly correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. A backup plan involved laying a cable across the Bering Straits, connecting London to Siberia, then to Canada, and finally to San Francisco and New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. This land-based route is why many places in British Columbia bear the name "Telegraph," such as Telegraph Road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. New Westminster was designated as a major station for this alternative cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. Both the transatlantic and Bering Straits cables were laid in parallel, reflecting the widespread skepticism about the Atlantic cable's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>.

### Oliver Heaviside's Contributions

The failure of the first cable was because engineers did not listen to Oliver Heaviside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:22">[00:35:22]</a>. Heaviside, a self-taught, reclusive, and partially deaf individual, struggled with interpersonal communication and was known for his sarcastic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>. Despite developing fundamental principles in telecommunication, he remains largely unrecognized, with only a few things named after him, such as the Heaviside layer in the atmosphere and the Heaviside transform in mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>. Heaviside correctly understood how to construct a functional cable, but it took many years for his insights to be accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.

AT&T reportedly attempted to pay Heaviside millions to patent his ideas to secure a monopoly on long-distance telegraphy and telephony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. He refused, stating his work was published and freely available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. When AT&T realized his sincerity, they allegedly paid a U.S. inventor named Michael Pupin to patent Heaviside's ideas and then bought the patent from Pupin for a substantial sum to prevent challenges to their patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. This historical fraud greatly disturbed Norbert Wiener, the pioneer of modern control theory, who even wrote a fictional book about it, fearing legal action from AT&T <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. The book, laden with differential equations on its cover, remained largely unnoticed and forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>.

### Telegraphy Equipment

The transatlantic cable ended in Halifax, Nova Scotia, from where signals were transmitted by land cable to New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>. The receiving station, known as Halifax Depot, used a "mirror galvanometer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. This sensitive instrument, invented by Lord Kelvin, featured a small mirror that would move in response to the faint electrical currents from the cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>. An operator would observe the reflected light spot on a wall, interpreting its movements as dots or dashes, and then manually transcribe them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>. The signal was too weak for most standard printing or sound telegraphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>. Once transcribed, the message could be sent via a normal telegraph to New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>, where equipment like recording telegraphs would print the message onto paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.

## Evolution of Telegraph Systems

While everyone associates the electric telegraph with Morse, Samuel Morse did not invent the electric telegraph itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. Earlier electric telegraphs existed but required multiple wires (some up to five per character) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. Morse's significant contribution was inventing a telegraph that required only a single wire, or even a return to the ground, making it far more economical for inter-city implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>.

### Wheatstone Telegraph

A few years before Morse, Wheatstone in England invented a very ingenious and simple one-wire telegraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>. This device, now quite rare, consisted of a transmitter and a receiver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. The transmitter would break the current a certain number of times based on the wheel's clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a>. For example, to send the fifth letter of the alphabet, it would break the current five times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>. The receiver, featuring a coil and a ratchet wheel, would advance one letter for each electrical pulse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>. A key advantage was that it spelled out the text in plain English, eliminating the need to learn Morse code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>. Its main disadvantage was that it required more signals per letter (an average of 13 pulses for 26 letters) compared to Morse code's average of about 4 pulses per letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>. However, for land telegraphy, the operator's speed, not the cable's electrical speed, remained the limiting factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>. The Wheatstone telegraph, dating back to around 1830, was largely forgotten due to Morse's superior business and promotional skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.

## Societal Attitudes Towards New Inventions

Around a century or two ago, society displayed a much greater optimism regarding new inventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>. Unlike today, where new chemicals or materials are immediately scrutinized for potential diseases and safety concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>, the prevailing attitude was that new discoveries would inherently cure diseases, requiring only the identification of the correct ailment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>. This led to an era of widespread quack medicine.

For instance, following the discovery of radioactivity and radium, their glow-in-the-dark properties led to the belief that they must be healthy or curative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. From the 1920s to the 1930s, radioactive elements were sold to the public as health aids, including radium drops and radioactive creams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>. People even believed that storing drinking water in radioactive containers was healthy, as evidenced by advertisements for radium jars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>. Vendors competed on the radioactivity levels of their jars, specifying their "millicuries of radioactivity," and the FDA would remove products that didn't meet their advertised radioactive claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>.

Similarly, upon the discovery of tapeworms, they were ironically sold to women as a weight-loss solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>. Another example was the sale of high-voltage generators, which delivered electric shocks, to doctors to treat "mental diseases," based on the assumption that an electrical shock must have some curative effect if not for physical ailments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:08">[00:47:08]</a>. Thousands of these "top-of-the-line" machines, which allowed users to dial in the strength of the shock, were heavily used and are now found completely worn out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.

## High-Tech Fraud: The Keeley Motor Company

The history of high-tech is not immune to fraud, especially when money is involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. Prior to the recent Theranos scandal, the largest high-tech fraud was the Keeley Motor Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>.

John Keeley, a self-taught musician and mechanic in Philadelphia, began in 1872 to attract investors with the claim that he could extract "atomic vibrations" from water to create free energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>. He built a peculiar machine that would only start by playing a specific tune on a violin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. Although initial tests found nothing amiss and the machine appeared to produce significant power, it was later discovered after Keeley's death that an elaborate system of shafts in the walls, driven by an engine in the basement, powered the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. His "electric wires" were actually hollow and transmitted compressed air to other machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>.

Keeley managed to sustain this scam for 26 years, from 1872 until his death in 1898, living as a respected and prosperous citizen of Philadelphia involved in charities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>. He promised to build a car engine capable of crossing the U.S. on one quart of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>. While engineers designed the mechanical parts, Keeley focused on the "harmonizer," the mystical component that supposedly extracted energy from water, keeping its mechanism a secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>.

When investors pressured him for results, Keeley announced a "much better engine" that could run on a mere thimble-full of water, causing further delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>. Despite investors' protests that the quart-of-water engine was sufficient, a judge sided with Keeley, stating that a scientist could not be forced to compromise their "scientific integrity" by producing an inferior engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>. This bought him more time to continue the charade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>. Even when a skeptical U.S. scientist couldn't find the fraud, a British expert surprisingly declared Keeley's engine a genuine new principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>. After Keeley died, his house was dismantled, revealing the elaborate fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. The Keeley Motor Company thus served as the quintessential example of high-tech fraud before Theranos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. Shares of the extinct Keeley Motor Company are still available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>.

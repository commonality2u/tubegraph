A [[laser center finder for alignment | laser center finder]] is a highly useful accessory for machine tools, particularly drill mills, although it is not commercially available and must be self-made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:20">[02:15:20]</a>. This device significantly improves alignment precision and speed in various machining operations.

## Construction and Design
The [[laser center finder for alignment | laser center finder]] is constructed from a modified [[ted_maiman_and_the_development_of_the_first_laser | laser]] pointer head, with its lens adjusted to focus at a specific distance, powered by a battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. It is designed to clip onto the chuck or directly onto the shank when using collets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. The external casing is easily made using a water jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

## Functionality and Use
When activated, the device projects a circle of light where the center of the circle precisely indicates the axis of the spindle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

### Alignment Procedures
The [[laser center finder for alignment | laser center finder]] offers several methods for accurate alignment:

*   **Aligning with a Mark**: To align the machine with a specific mark for drilling, simply position the projected circle over the mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. For larger areas, the spot can be made bigger to help find the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **Aligning with a Hole or Pin**: The device is particularly useful for aligning the spindle with an existing hole or pin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. When aligned, the light forms a sensitive ring around the feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Misalignment causes the ring to move, allowing for precise adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. For a hole, adjust until the ring of light appears horizontal within the hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.
*   **Cross-Drilling**: For cross-drilling, adjust the position until the light beam is broken at both ends simultaneously, forming a 'V' shape on both sides, indicating the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

### Accuracy
This simple device can achieve alignment accuracy of approximately 50 microns (0.05 mm) with ease and speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

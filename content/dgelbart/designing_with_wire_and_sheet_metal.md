When approaching design, a hierarchy of ease and cost exists for manufacturing parts, with wire and sheet metal being the most efficient options before resorting to solid material fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Designing with Wire

Wire is considered the easiest and cheapest material to work with in design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### Advantages of Wire Design
*   **Zero Waste** Wire comes on a spool, resulting in absolutely no material waste during production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Minimal Finishing** Wire designs require minimal finishing, as there's no need to deburr corners; only sharp ends of the wire need to be managed, which can be hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
*   **Cost-Effective Production** CNC machines are available that can bend wire into any shape very cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Modern machines feed wire from a bushing, and four computer-controlled fingers bend it in a full circle as it's fed, eliminating the need for expensive custom tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This allows complex shapes to be formed in the air without any physical tooling, offering an immense advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

### Examples
*   Wire bottle caps are a good example of efficient wire design, as they latch and open beautifully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Designing with Sheet Metal

If a design cannot be made from wire, sheet metal is the next consideration in the design hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

### Advantages of Sheet Metal Design
*   **Specific Applications** Sheet metal can work exceptionally well for certain applications, sometimes even better than solid materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   **Superior Rigidity (for specific mechanisms)** Designs utilizing multiple surfaces, similar to a multi-disk clutch, can achieve immense locking power and rigidity even with small hinges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. The total friction is multiplied by the number of surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

### Integration with other Fabrication Techniques
*   Sheet metal designs often leverage techniques such as [[designing_enclosures_using_waterjet_cutting | water jet]] cutting for precise fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

### Examples
*   An adjustable and lockable computer terminal or monitor holder is an example where sheet metal can provide a totally rigid lock, surpassing machined solid locks due to the multi-surface friction principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

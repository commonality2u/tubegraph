Ted Maiman is noted as one of the few inventors with whom the speaker had a personal connection, as Maiman and his wife, Kathleen, moved to Vancouver and became good friends with the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:40">[09:40:40]</a>. The laser discussed is not the world's first, but the second, as Ted Maiman's widowed wife, Kathleen Mayman, possesses the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. Ted Maiman reportedly had spare parts to construct an exact replica of the first laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:10">[10:00:10]</a>.

## Family Influence and Business Acumen

Ted Maiman's father, Abe Mayman, worked for Bell Labs in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:47">[10:11:47]</a>. At the time, there was a demand for a product that would allow people to listen to the radio while driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:10">[10:20:10]</a>. 1930s radios were typically cube radios requiring high voltage DC, unlike the low-voltage 6-volt DC found in cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. Abe Maiman conceived of a "vibrator" to convert the car's 6-volt DC to AC, which could then be transformed to a higher voltage and converted back to DC, enabling car radios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

However, when Abe Maiman consulted his supervisor at Bell Labs about patenting the vibrator, he was told that nobody would want it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. Consequently, he abandoned the idea, missing out on "endless millions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. Motorola later independently developed and profited immensely from similar technology for car radios, with the company name "Motorola" itself deriving from "moto video" to signify this business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. This history suggests that while Ted Maiman inherited his father's genius, he also inherited "some bad business sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.

## The Invention of the Laser

Ted Maiman's laser is described as simple in its construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. It consists of an internal flash lamp with a cylindrical reflector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a> and a ruby crystal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. Modern lasers typically have one side of the crystal fully mirrored and the other 99% mirrored to allow light to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. However, Maiman, lacking a ruby with a 99% coating, used a regular mirror and scratched out 1% of its middle surface to allow light to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>.

The first lasing event occurred on May 16, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. An entry from Ted Maiman's notebook shows the laser, charged with a capacitor, and his increasing the discharge until he makes a question mark, wondering if it's lasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>. Lasing action begins when the voltage in the capacitor causes the flash to exceed a certain light level, transitioning from fluorescence to coherent light emission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.

## Going Against Common Wisdom

Maiman's laser was revolutionary because it challenged several prevailing beliefs of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>:

*   **Solid Material vs. Gas**: At the time, experts believed gas was the best medium for a laser, envisioning long tubes filled with gas requiring immense power, which would lead to distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. Maiman understood that gas lacked sufficient molecules and would require too much power, and it took several more years for a gas laser to be successfully built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. He opted for a solid material instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.
*   **Pulsed Laser**: Maiman realized that a pulsed laser would prevent heating and distortion because it would only lase when the flashlight went off, in very fast pulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.
*   **Ruby as Lasing Material**: Despite many articles and analyses concluding that ruby, previously used in masers (microwave lasers), could not be used for a laser, Maiman's intuition told him otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>. He instructed his technician to re-measure, but the technician confirmed the published results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>. Maiman then performed the measurements himself, realizing that previous testing methods were "completely wrong," and that ruby was, in fact, one of the best materials for a laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>.

The entire development was completed on a budget of $50,000 within nine months, a strict limitation imposed by his bosses who wanted him to work on something "useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>. Other efforts, meanwhile, spent millions over years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>.

## Nobel Prize Controversy

Despite his groundbreaking invention, Ted Maiman did not receive a Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>. This is surprising because others who made improvements to the laser or who held the theory of the laser but could not build one (like Charles Townes and Nikolai Basov, along with Alexander Prokhorov, for maser-laser principle) received the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.

Speculation, as the Nobel Committee's archives are sealed, suggests that Townes, who wrote the paper on the laser and received a Nobel Prize, was envious that Maiman succeeded in building a laser when he could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>. Given that previous Nobel laureates have the first right to judge new candidates on the committee, it's theorized that Townes might have used his influence to prevent Maiman from receiving the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>. This remains a mystery in the [[edisons_phonograph | history of Nobel Prizes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>.

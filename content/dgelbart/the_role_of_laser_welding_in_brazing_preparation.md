When creating complex, rigid, and machinable three-dimensional structures, a common challenge is assembling components that resemble castings but avoid the tedious process of pattern making associated with traditional casting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While traditional [[comparison_between_welding_and_adhesive_bonding | welding]] is an industrial standard for building up parts, [[advantages_of_brazing_over_welding_in_prototype_assembly | brazing]] offers distinct advantages, particularly in research and development environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

One crucial step in preparing parts for [[advantages_of_brazing_over_welding_in_prototype_assembly | brazing]] is securing them in place before the [[advantages_of_brazing_over_welding_in_prototype_assembly | brazing]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This ensures proper alignment and prevents displacement during heating.

## Securing Components for Brazing

Components can be temporarily secured in place using various methods:
*   **Water jet tabs/fingers:** Parts cut on a water jet machine can include small tabs or square holes for registration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Dowel pins:** Simple dowel pins can be used to align and hold parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Tack welding:** Parts can be [[spot_welding_basics_and_safety_precautions | tack welded]] in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. While a [[spot_welding_basics_and_safety_precautions | spot welder]] can tack components, it cannot be used for the actual [[advantages_of_brazing_over_welding_in_prototype_assembly | brazing]] process itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Laser welding:** A laser welder is an effective, albeit more exotic, method for tacking pieces in place before [[advantages_of_brazing_over_welding_in_prototype_assembly | brazing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Advantages of Laser Welding in Preparation

While a laser welder is considered a luxury, it offers significant benefits for temporary assembly:
*   **Versatility:** Laser welders are surprisingly versatile machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Access:** They can weld into very hard-to-reach places, as long as the area can be seen with a microscope and light can reach it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Dissimilar Metals:** A key advantage of laser welding is its ability to weld very [[creating_custom_electrodes_for_specific_welding_needs | dissimilar metals]] together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This is highly beneficial when preparing an assembly where different materials are desired in various sectionsâ€”for example, a steel base with a brass boss for bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Unlike [[comparison_between_welding_and_adhesive_bonding | welding]], which struggles with steel and brass, laser welding allows combinations like aluminum to steel or silver to lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Speed and Oxidation Control:** The pulse of a laser welder is so fast that it prevents oxidation, even on regular steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. It can weld without any inert atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Temporary Nature:** Laser welds are temporary and can be easily broken if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

Using a laser welder to tack components in place allows for the creation of complex assemblies with [[creating_custom_electrodes_for_specific_welding_needs | dissimilar metals]] before the final [[advantages_of_brazing_over_welding_in_prototype_assembly | brazing]] process, which results in a near-net shape product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

A crucial [[modifications_to_improve_waterjet_cutter_productivity | modification]] for [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | waterjet cutters]] is the addition of a laser pointer to enhance precision and productivity. This tool helps operators know exactly where the jet will impact the material, offering several benefits for [[high_precision_machining_techniques | accurate cutting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Function and Installation
The laser pointer is designed to shine through the exact path of the waterjet beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. It is precisely made to fit where the Fe tube normally goes; users can pull out the Fe tube and plug in the laser pointer in its place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. To prevent water from obstructing the laser, it is typically plugged into an air supply, which keeps the nozzle clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Benefits and Applications
1.  **Precise Beam Alignment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>: The primary benefit is that the laser spot indicates the exact point where the waterjet will hit the metal, as it follows the same path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This is particularly important when resuming a job after an interruption, ensuring accurate alignment for continuous cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
2.  **Wear Measurement**: The shape of the laser spot can also indicate the wear level of the mixing tube. By observing the spot's shape, operators can determine if the mixing tube needs replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
3.  **Registration to Existing Features**: The laser pointer is invaluable when needing to combine waterjet cuts with pre-existing features, such as bolt holes or other precision holes. It allows for accurate registration of new cuts to these established points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

While homemade versions exist, laser center finders for machine alignment, similar to this laser pointer for waterjets, are expected to become commercially available from manufacturers like OMEX Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

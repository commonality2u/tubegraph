For prototyping, two primary cutting machines are often considered: the waterjet cutter and the plasma cutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While both serve to cut materials, they differ significantly in cost, versatility, and application.

## Waterjet Cutter

The [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | waterjet cutter]] is identified as the key machine for making prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The OMAX 2654 waterjet cutter is mentioned as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. It is the most expensive piece of equipment needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Capabilities and [[benefits_and_applications_of_water_jet_cutting | Applications]]
*   **Versatility:** A waterjet can cut "practically anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Thickness:** Capable of cutting materials up to 2 inches thick or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Cut Quality:** Provides a beautiful cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Ideal Machine:** It is considered the ideal machine due to its capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### [[modifications_to_improve_waterjet_cutter_productivity | Modifications for Improved Productivity]]
Several modifications can enhance the productivity and usability of a waterjet cutter:

*   **Sliding Basket:** To prevent small or even large parts from dropping into the tank filled with discarded garnet and being lost, adding a sliding basket is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This basket rests below the sleds, about 8 inches or 20 cm from the top, to avoid being cut by the jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. It can be moved via a pulley for easy retrieval of cut parts and reusable slug metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This is especially important for materials thicker than an eighth of an inch, as tabs cannot be easily broken off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **[[using_laser_pointers_for_precision_in_waterjet_cutting | Laser Pointer]] for Beam Alignment:** A laser pointer that shines through the beam path of the jet helps indicate exactly where the jet will hit the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. It's precisely made to fit where the feed tube goes and uses an air supply to keep the nozzle clean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
    *   **Dual Functionality:** Beyond alignment for precision cuts or resuming stopped jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, the shape of the laser spot also indicates wear in the mixing tube, signaling when it needs replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This is particularly useful for registering cuts to pre-existing features like bolt holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Splash Guard Cap:** Half of a tennis ball makes an effective and space-saving splash guard, allowing close cuts to edges and easy flipping for observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Custom Clamps:** Waterjet-cut clamps can be easily made to secure materials ranging from 0 to 1 inch thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Thicker materials are usually heavy enough to not require clamping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Plasma Cutter

A plasma cutter is considered the "poor man's version" of a waterjet cutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Brands like Torch Mate produce CNC plasma cutters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Cost and Operating Cost
A plasma cutter is about 1/10th the cost and 1/10th the operating cost of a waterjet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. A whole machine can be as inexpensive as $1,000 or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. It requires compressed air and standard household power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Limitations and [[applications_of_plasma_cutters | Applications]]
*   **Versatility:** It is much less versatile than a waterjet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Cut Quality:** Does not cut as well as a waterjet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. While a handheld cut may be uneven, putting the torch on a CNC table yields a "quite nice" cut, acceptable for sheet metal work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Material Limitations:** Only cuts metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> and does not cut all metals equally well, particularly struggling with copper or materials that conduct heat away very fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. It will not cut non-metallics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. It can cut stainless steel and aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Thickness:** Smaller units cut up to 1/4 inch steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, while bigger ones can cut up to 3/4 inch steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Specific Use Case:** A plasma cutter is particularly useful when cutting holes in large items like electronic enclosures or car parts that cannot fit into a waterjet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This is done by creating an oversized template on the waterjet, clamping it to the workpiece, and guiding the plasma torch along the template <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Insulating the tip with a ceramic cap (or tape for quick jobs) is recommended to prevent electrical contact and maintain proper distance from the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Safety:** When operating a plasma cutter, it is crucial to wear goggles to protect against sparks and intense UV emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## Conclusion

While a [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | waterjet cutter]] is the ideal machine for its precision and versatility across materials, a [[applications_of_plasma_cutters | CNC plasma cutter]] offers a significantly more budget-friendly alternative that can still accomplish many tasks, especially for metal sheet work or when dealing with oversized parts that cannot be brought to a waterjet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The choice between the two often depends on budget and specific project requirements.

Generally, there isn't a significant [[safety_considerations_when_using_cutting_equipment | safety hazard]] associated with using hand tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. However, the most considerable hazard arises during hammering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Hammering

### Eye Protection
When hammering or chiseling, it is advisable to wear goggles, even if you are already wearing prescription safety glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Hard Steel on Hard Steel
A primary rule for hammering is to never strike hard steel on hard steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The face of a hammer is made of hard steel to prevent rapid destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Tools designed to be hammered, such as chisels or punches, typically have a soft end where the hammer strikes and a hard end that performs the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. You can identify the soft end by attempting to file it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

Striking hard steel on hard steel can cause immense stress at the impact point, leading to a piece of metal flying off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This flying fragment can carry most of the hammer's energy, sufficient to penetrate a person's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Therefore, never hammer hard on hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

If a situation necessitates hitting hard on hard, for example, to indent something with a hard ball, always do so through a piece of soft material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This allows the soft material to indent without causing chipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Mushrooming
The soft end of tools designed for hammering will eventually deform and "mushroom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Periodically, this mushroomed material must be ground off to prevent pieces from breaking away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Testing Material Hardness
If you are unsure whether a material is hardened, there are two simple methods to determine its hardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>:

*   **Filing Test**: Attempt to file the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. A soft material will be easily filed, while a hard material will resist the file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Bounce Test**: If a file is not available, drop the material onto a known hardened surface and observe how much it bounces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. A softer material will exhibit little to no bounce, whereas a hardened material will bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Always be aware if the material you are working with is hardened, and if it is, do not hit it with a hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

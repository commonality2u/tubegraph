This article covers [[basics_of_drilling_and_center_punching | fundamental aspects]] of machining, specifically focusing on [[techniques_for_measuring_and_ensuring_precision_in_mechanical_parts | precise hole drilling]] and reaming for mechanical parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Drilling a Hole

To drill a precise hole, the process typically begins with accurate marking and preparation.

### Center Punching and Scribing
When drilling a hole, it's usually necessary to center punch the location to guide the drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. For accurate center punch placement, lines are usually laid out by scribing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Any sharp tool, like a scriber, can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Crucially, the center punch is located by feel rather than by looking at the lines, as this method is much more accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The punch is slid along the scribed line until it "locks in place" at the intersection of lines, indicating it has gripped the crossing point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

After feeling the lock, a light center mark is pressed, which is then reinforced with a bigger center mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Center punches must be kept very sharp, typically sharpened at a 90-degree tip angle, to allow for this tactile location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

If lines are difficult to see, a razor ball marker can be used to go over the area. This makes the lines more visible and can be wiped off instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Multi-Step Drilling for Precision
For very [[techniques_for_measuring_and_ensuring_precision_in_mechanical_parts | precise holes]], or when drilling large sizes, it's recommended to start with a smaller diameter hole and then enlarge it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This is because larger drills have a wider web (the material between the flutes), which can straddle a center mark, preventing the drill from centering itself accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. A smaller pilot drill centers itself more effectively on the mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

When using a [[drill_press_techniques_and_timesaving_tips | drill press]], it's a good practice to zero the electronic readout. This allows you to return to the correct position if handles are accidentally bumped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Center Drills
If a center punch was not used, or for initial rigidity, starting with a center drill is a good idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Center drills are very rigid and prevent wandering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Reaming for Accuracy

Reaming is the next step after drilling for achieving more accurate hole diameters and surface finishes, especially for applications like bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Reaming Process
1.  **Undersized Drilling**: The initial hole should be drilled undersized, typically by 0.1 to 0.2 millimeters, before reaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
2.  **Lubrication**: Apply cutting oil or wax to the reamer, especially for materials like aluminum that can stick to the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
3.  **Low Speed**: Reaming should be done at a low speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
4.  **Reamer Flexibility**: Don't worry about run-out; the reamer is flexible and will self-align in the hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

The result of reaming is a nice, reamed hole that provides a tight fit, for example, for a 10-millimeter dowel pin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Inserting Precise Shafts
When attempting to put a very precise shaft into a very precise hole, binding often occurs due to fundamental geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. To avoid this locking condition, a recess should be machined into the shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

The recess typically involves leaving one millimeter of the full diameter, followed by a groove a few millimeters wide, and then resuming the full diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This narrow link of the correct diameter allows for slight tilting, preventing locking, and as the shaft goes further in, the second correct diameter self-aligns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This trick is essential, especially for large shafts and bearings, as it prevents hours of struggle trying to insert them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Limitations of Reaming
Reamers do not work in blind holes because they are slightly tapered and require going through the material to achieve accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. For special sized holes without a reamer, blind holes, or large holes, a boring head must be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Deburring and Countersinking
While the workpiece is still set up after drilling, it is the ideal time to [[methods_for_deburring_and_countersinking | deburr]] the hole using a countersink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. If a drill leaves a large burr, it often indicates that the drill itself was not sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

For deburring from the inside, such as a hole within a pipe or box where a regular deburring tool cannot reach, a tool resembling a wood chisel, sharpened at a dull angle (80-90 degrees) and slightly rounded, can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This tool is inserted almost parallel to the surface at a slight angle and hit with a hammer to shear off internal burrs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

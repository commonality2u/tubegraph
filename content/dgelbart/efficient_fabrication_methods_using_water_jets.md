This guide outlines efficient fabrication methods, primarily focusing on the use of [[Benefits and applications of water jet cutting | water jet cutting]] as an enabling technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It is designed for students, scientists, and researchers who may not have formal machinist training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The emphasis is on building items quickly using easily mastered equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

This approach is beneficial for [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | prototyping]] and, to a limited extent, for production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Course Content Overview
The course covers:
*   Basic setup, including necessary tools and machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   [[modifications_to_improve_waterjet_cutter_productivity | Modifications]] to machines to enhance productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   Step-by-step fabrication of parts, starting with a simple enclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Applications of Water Jet Cutting
[[Benefits and applications of water jet cutting | Water jet cutting]] offers a wide range of advantages for various fabrication needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Enclosures
The most common application is for [[Utilizing Waterjet Cutting for Electronic Enclosure Precision | enclosures]], ranging from simple boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Captive Hardware**: For R&D work, enclosures can be designed with all captive hardware, meaning no screws are needed to hold the cover; it simply snaps into place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This eliminates the need to remove screws and prevents them from falling into machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Knockouts and Keyholes**: [[Utilizing Waterjet Cutting for Electronic Enclosure Precision | Water jet cutting]] allows for pre-cut knockouts, similar to electrical boxes, to avoid later drilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Keyholes can be used instead of regular holes, saving significant time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Embossing**: To create lightweight and strong enclosures or parts, water jets can be used to make dies for embossing ribs. These ribs can be put in rapidly (e.g., one minute) using a die made from two spot-welded pieces cut on the water jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **U-Shaped Piece Design**: A preferred design approach for boxes is to construct them from U-shaped pieces rather than bending a single piece on all four sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This simplifies bending on a brake, as a full-length bar can be used without needing to adjust brake segments, saving minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Flexures
Flexures are another natural application for [[Benefits and applications of water jet cutting | water jet cutting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Monolithic and Tiny Flexures**: Flexures can be monolithic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, and very tiny ones can be produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. For example, fiber optics applications use flexures as small as can be made with a water jet, such as a four-axis positioner with X, Y, TA, and FE tilt movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Spring Material Flexures**: Flexures can also be made from spring material, where everything is sheet metal and a middle part moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. These can incorporate spot-welded springs, sometimes using Nitinol instead of steel for a very large elastic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Cross-Spring Hinges**: A cross-spring hinge can be created entirely from spot-welded Nitinol flexures, functioning like a normal hinge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Advantages**: Flexures offer significant advantages over traditional slides, including no wear, no lubrication, no backlash, and rapid fabrication (minutes instead of costly slides) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Large Structures
[[Benefits and applications of water jet cutting | Water jet cutting]] is also well-suited for very large structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Complex assemblies can be fabricated from elements cut using this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Springs
Springs are another simple yet versatile application for [[Benefits and applications of water jet cutting | water jet cutting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Solid Steel Springs**: Springs can be carved from solid steel, either cut from hard material or cut in the annealed state and then hardened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. These can be designed to require hundreds of kilograms to compress, which would be difficult to wind from thick wire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Disc Springs with Spiral**: [[Benefits and applications of water jet cutting | Water jet cutting]] can create disc springs with a spiral design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   **Minimum Clearance**: These disc springs compress completely flat, reducing to the material's thickness, which ensures minimum clearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
    *   **Programmable K-Function**: Unlike traditional springs, these can have a non-constant K (spring rate). A constant width spiral will result in a progressive K, as the outer spiral deflects more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. By linearly tapering the spiral, a constant K can be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This allows for arbitrary K functions based on a desired force versus distance plot, which is useful for springs needing a wide dynamic range (sensitive to small pressures but able to hold large pressures before bottoming out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Minimizing Machining
[[Benefits and applications of water jet cutting | Water jet cutting]] can significantly minimize the need for subsequent machining, especially for parts requiring [[high_precision_machining_techniques | high precision machining techniques]] beyond the water jet's inherent accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Painting Technique**: For accurate parts, the entire part can be water jet cut, then painted, and finally clamped for touch-up machining on the painted surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This method is much faster than traditional masking, painting, and cleaning leftover paint, as the paint is tough enough to withstand clamping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. In some cases, 95% of the work is done by water jet, with only 5% of the rim machined afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Complex Assemblies**: Structures that appear complicated, like gearboxes rotating on two axes, can be simplified by breaking them down into simple water jet cut enclosures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Bearing mounts can be small inserts attached with screws to the housing for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Such assemblies often use timing belts for gearing and incorporate captive hardware and keyholes to avoid needing to remove screws for access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Thicker sections can be added or welded on and machined after the main structure is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Chucks and Gripping Mechanisms
Even items like chucks that grip at different diameters can be fabricated almost entirely from water jet cut parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Water Jet Cut Helix**: A pipe and ring can be pressed together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The internal scroll that activates the arms can be a [[Benefits and applications of water jet cutting | water jet cut]] helix into which a flexible steel strip is inserted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This means the spring is already hard and smooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, avoiding the extensive work of machining, hardening, and CNC grinding a single steel piece for accuracy and wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

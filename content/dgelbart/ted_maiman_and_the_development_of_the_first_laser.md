Ted Maiman is credited with creating the first laser. The speaker has a personal connection to Maiman, having become good friends with him and his wife Kathleen Mayman after they moved to Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. The laser in the speaker's possession is the second one Maiman built, identical to the first, which is owned by his widow, Kathleen Mayman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.

## A Legacy of Innovation and Business Acumen

Ted Maiman inherited some of his genius from his father, Abe Mayman, but also a degree of poor business sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>. Abe Mayman worked for Bell Labs in the 1930s, and at a time when car radios needed high voltage DC but cars only provided low-voltage 6-volt DC, he conceived of a "vibrator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. This device used a coil to resonate a blade with electrical contacts, converting the car's DC to AC, transforming it to a higher voltage, and then converting it back to DC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. This would allow people to listen to radio while driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. However, Bell Labs advised him against patenting it, stating that no one would want to listen to the radio while driving, leading him to miss out on millions later earned by Motorola, a company whose name originates from "motor video" due to its focus on car radios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

## Maiman's Laser Design

The first laser constructed by Ted Maiman was notably simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. Its core components included a flash lamp with a cylindrical reflector and a ruby crystal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.

Historically, one side of laser crystals is fully mirrored, and the other is 99% mirrored to allow light to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. Maiman, lacking a ruby with a 99% coating, improvised by taking a regular mirror and scratching out the middle, making only 1% of the area reflective for light to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>.

The first laser action occurred on May 16, 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. Maiman's notebook shows him charging a capacitor to increase the voltage to the flash lamp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>. At lower light levels, the crystal would only fluoresce, but above a certain energy threshold, the lasing action began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.

## Defying Conventional Wisdom

Maiman's success with the laser went against all common wisdom of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>.
His key insights were:

*   **Solid Material over Gas:** Experts believed lasers would best be made using long gas tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. Maiman realized that gases lacked sufficient molecules, requiring immense power that would cause distortion. It took several years after Maiman's invention for a gas laser to be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. He chose a solid material instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.
*   **Pulsed Laser Design:** Maiman understood the issues of heating and distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>. He opted for a pulsed laser, which only lased when the flashlight pulsed, preventing heat buildup and distortion because the pulse was so fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>.
*   **Ruby as Lasing Material:** Ruby was known to be used in masers (microwave lasers), the predecessor to the laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>. However, analysis suggested ruby could not be used for a laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. Having worked with ruby during his PhD, Maiman had a strong intuition for the material and did not believe the published papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. He instructed his technician to re-measure ruby's internal gain, but the technician confirmed the published findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>. Maiman then performed the measurements himself, discovering that the common testing methods were incorrect, and that ruby was, in fact, an excellent material for a laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>.

The entire project was completed on a budget of $50,000 within nine months, a limitation set by his bosses who wanted him to work on "something useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>. Despite his groundbreaking work, Maiman never received a Nobel Prize, unlike others who made improvements to the laser or theorized about it, such as Townes and Chelev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>. Speculation suggests that Townes, a previous Nobel laureate and a judge on the Nobel Committee, may have intentionally downplayed Maiman's work out of jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>. The real reason remains a mystery, as Nobel Committee archives are sealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>.

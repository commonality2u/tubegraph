The press brake is a precision machine used for [[bending_techniques_using_press_brakes | bending]] and flattening metal sheets and plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. A typical setup of a press brake designates different sections for specific tasks: one side for regular bends, another for various [[custom_tooling_for_bending | custom bends]] and [[custom_tooling_for_bending | custom tooling]], and a third section dedicated to flattening or undoing incorrect bends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Operation and Gauging

Operating a press brake involves setting the desired bend on a gauge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Machines can feature either a digital gauge for precise input or a manual gauge, both of which are effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Tools and Dies

### Standard and Specialty Tools
The choice of tool significantly impacts the type of bend achievable:
*   **Regular Tool** A common tool often used is a V-shaped die at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Gooseneck Tool** This tool features a distinct profile that allows for bending narrow channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Unlike regular tools, it prevents interference when forming U-shapes that are narrower than their depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This is particularly advantageous for prototyping, where many parts are small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Deep Channel Tool** Tools with a hole in their profile can create very deep U-bends, even those deeper than their width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. These tools are often [[homemade_and_diy_machine_tools | custom-made]], with cuts commonly performed by a [[combining_water_jet_cutting_with_presswork | water jet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. To save costs, one long bar can be purchased and then cut into various segment lengths (e.g., 1-inch, 2-inch, 3-inch pieces) to achieve desired dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Radius Tools** For aesthetic or functional reasons, a press brake can produce radius bends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This is achieved by using a set of radius tools, often equipped with magnets to help them stick to the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Die Opening
The thickness of metal that can be bent is influenced by the material's width and the opening of the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. A 24-ton press brake can typically bend full widths of metal up to gauge 12 (just under 3 mm) with a standard die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Wider dies allow for bending thicker materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. To avoid constant tool changes, it's often recommended to use a 3/4-inch die, which provides versatility for bending thick material in narrow sections and full-width steel up to 2.5-3 mm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Aluminum, being softer, allows for bending even thicker gauges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Flattening and Annealing

While a press brake has an "undo" button for wrong bends, it cannot perfectly flatten metal again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This is because the process requires immense pressure to make the metal flow again, and the metal undergoes work hardening during the initial bend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Simply undoing a bend will leave a visible ridge or mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Even a 100-ton press struggles to completely remove these marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For a clean, perfectly flat result after an incorrect bend, the metal must first be annealed, which involves heating it to red hot with a butane torch before attempting to flatten it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Useful Modifications and Accessories

### Measuring Table
A [[homemade_and_diy_machine_tools | custom-made]] or purchased table with measurement marks is useful for bending narrow strips of metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. It allows for accurate alignment, ensuring the piece is square when only one stop can be touched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Front Adjustment for Bend Angle
Press brakes typically come with a rear adjustment for bending angles less than 90 degrees, which can be inconvenient to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. A useful modification is to add a front adjustment, such as an air valve, that shuts off the air when the desired depth is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This allows for simpler adjustment of angles other than 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Sliding Tube on Fingers
The fingers, which support the workpiece, are usually supplied with a press brake in a narrow configuration. However, if they are too wide, they cannot easily reach very narrow spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. A very useful modification involves narrowing down the original round bar of the finger and then adding a sliding tube over it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This allows the narrow finger to enter tight spaces for narrow bends, while the sliding tube provides a wider resting area when the part is farther away, preventing it from missing the fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Applications and Techniques

### Brackets
Brackets are very common components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. A simple right-angle bracket can be made by bending a piece of metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. To increase rigidity, several methods can be employed:
*   **Adding a Brace** A separate brace can be bent and spot-welded to the bracket. Holding it against a square during welding ensures accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Triangular Stiffener** A triangular stiffener piece with two bent sides can be inserted into the bracket and spot-welded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This method does not require an additional square because the triangular piece itself is bent square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Integrated Rib** For simple, stiffer brackets where space is limited, a rib can be bent directly into the metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This is done by leaving a space between two segments on the press brake and using a hardened steel blade with a rounded top, positioned flush with the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. As the bend is made, the blade simultaneously creates a rib, which provides immense stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Even after [[basics_of_machining_techniques | finish machining]], parts that appear beautiful may not be accurate enough for moving assemblies. If moving parts are simply built from machined components, they will quickly wear out and develop play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Problem with Machined Surfaces

When a finely machined part mates with another, it only touches at a few high spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This can be demonstrated by coloring the surface with a dry-erase marker and sliding it against a very accurate granite plate. The marker will only rub off at these few contact points, leaving most of the surface untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

If an assembly with movement relies on such a part, these few high spots will quickly wear off, causing the part to become loose and lose accuracy very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Benefits of Full Bearing Surfaces

A full bearing surface offers significant advantages:
*   **Reduced Wear**: With a larger surface area in contact, there's more material to wear away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Zero Wear with Lubrication**: If a perfectly flat surface is lubricated, it will act hydrodynamically, creating an oil film that prevents metal-to-metal contact, leading to zero wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This principle is used in modern hard drive spindles and quieter computer fans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Increased Accuracy and Stiffness**: A fully bearing surface is more accurate because it doesn't "walk" and sits precisely. It is also stiffer, as the load is distributed over the entire area, preventing high pressure points and allowing it to bear heavier loads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## Achieving Surface Flatness

To achieve a true full bearing surface, especially for [[high_accuracy_in_machining | high accuracy]] parts, specific finishing techniques are required beyond initial machining.

### Grinding

Surface grinding is an intermediate step that produces better accuracy and a nicer-looking surface than milling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This is because grinding involves much smaller forces between the cutting tool and workpiece, and less clamping force, reducing distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. However, even a ground surface will still only touch at a few spots when tested; it is not accurate enough for a full bearing area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Lapping

Lapping is ideal for small parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
It involves moving the part in a randomized motion on an abrasive surface, such as emery cloth or paper, typically on a clean granite surface plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

#### Lapping Process
1.  **Preparation**: Clean a granite surface plate. Adhere emery paper (e.g., 220, 180, or 400 grit) to the plate, possibly with a drop of water to help it stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
2.  **Motion**: Lap the part in a figure-8 motion, applying uniform pressure unless correcting for specific high spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
3.  **Goal**: Continue lapping until the entire surface appears dull and all machining marks are removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
4.  **Testing**: After lapping, test the surface for full contact using a marker or by observing shiny high spots when tilting the part against a flat reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The goal is for the entire surface to become shiny, indicating full area bearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

#### Specialized Lapping
*   **Holes**: Use a split lap with abrasive paper around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **External Surfaces**: Use a split external lap, often on a lathe, moving the lap back and forth while the part turns to randomize the motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Limitations**: Only shapes that can be moved in two directions (e.g., flat, sphere, cylinder) can be accurately lapped to achieve precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

#### Lapping Considerations
*   **Soft Materials**: When lapping soft materials like aluminum or brass, there is a risk of abrasive particles embedding in the material, causing the soft material itself to act as a permanent lap and continue to wear down the mating part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. To prevent this, use a softer lapping compound specifically designed for soft materials, or apply less pressure with regular compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Honing**: Honing is a related term, similar to single-axis lapping, typically using a grinding stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Scraping

Scraping is preferred for large parts, like machine bases, that are too heavy to lap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
It involves:
1.  **Detection**: Touching the surface with a reference plate and identifying high spots, either by reflection or by applying a marking ink (e.g., Prussian blue) to the reference surface and rubbing it against the workpiece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
2.  **Removal**: Using a specialized scraper tool (a chisel-like bit ground flat at 90 degrees) to peel off very thin layers of metal from the high spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The scraping direction is typically alternated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
3.  **Iteration**: Repeating the process of testing and scraping until the high spots are uniformly spread across the entire surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
4.  **Tools**: For large areas, power scrapers are used to speed up the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

High-precision machine tools feature truly scraped surfaces, while less precise tools might have a "fake" scraped appearance (grinding marks with some scraping on top) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

## Achieving Other Geometries

The principles used for flatness can be extended to achieve [[high_accuracy_in_machining | high accuracy]] in other geometries:

### Squareness
To achieve perfect right angles (e.g., to one micron or better), a part can be clamped to a known very square reference (like a master square) and then ground or milled. Subsequent lapping can flatten the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

### Parallelism
Once one side is flat and square, parallelism can be achieved by turning the part over on a surface grinder and then lapping. Minor errors in parallelism (e.g., one micron difference) can be corrected by leaning slightly on the higher side during hand lapping, developing a feel for how to shift the load point to adjust the tilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

### Roundness and Runout
When checking roundness, it's important to separate it from runout. For a spindle, two probes at right angles can be used to generate two independent signals, allowing both runout and roundness to be determined separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

### Reversal Methods
A generic principle in metrology for measuring straightness, flatness, or roundness without a perfect reference is the "reversal method" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.
This involves:
1.  Measuring an unknown surface (F(x)) against another unknown surface (G(x)), yielding a combined measurement (e.g., F(x) + G(x)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.
2.  Flipping or reversing one of the parts and measuring again, yielding a different combined measurement (e.g., G(x) - F(x)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.
3.  With two independent equations and two unknowns, the individual characteristics of each surface (F(x) and G(x)) can be mathematically resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.
This powerful concept is used in many precision measurements, including separating spindle runout from roundness and accurately dividing circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

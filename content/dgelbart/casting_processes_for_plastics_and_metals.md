Two primary casting-like processes are discussed for creating parts from plastics and certain metals: [[vacuum_forming_with_plastics | vacuum forming]] and silicone rubber molding (replication).

## Vacuum Forming

[[vacuum_forming_with_plastics | Vacuum forming]] is a technique used to shape plastic sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It involves heating a plastic sheet until it softens and then quickly moving it over a mold, allowing a vacuum to pull the plastic down to conform to the mold's shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Materials and Equipment
*   **Plastics**: While various plastics can be used, Lexan is particularly difficult for [[vacuum_forming_with_plastics | vacuum forming]] because it does not soften easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Other plastics like PVC, ABS, and polyethylene form beautifully and pull down completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Lexan's advantages include its strength and shatterproof nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Equipment**:
    *   **Bottom Mold**: A mold is needed at the bottom for the plastic to form over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The vacuum spreads around the mold, so complex "roofs" or similar structures are not necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   **Top Frame**: A top frame is essential to clamp the plastic sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Without it, the ends of the plastic would pull in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
    *   **Heated Plastic Sheet**: The plastic sheet must be sufficiently heated to become pliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Process Considerations
*   **Cooling Time**: For normal plastics, it is crucial to allow the part to cool down completely on the mold to prevent distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Lexan, although still hot, hardens quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, whereas typical plastics remain soft for a longer period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Lexan Specifics**: Lexan is difficult because it does not soften easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> and quickly becomes hard as it cools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, which can prevent it from pulling down completely into the mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Silicone Rubber Molding (Replication)

[[prototyping_techniques_for_creating_castinglike_structures | Replication]] of parts in plastic is useful when a part with a very good finish or specific properties (like filled plastics not usable in [[high_resolution_3d_printing_for_metals_and_ceramics | 3D printers]]) is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This process involves creating a mold from silicone rubber and then casting the desired plastic or [[process_of_converting_sla_printed_parts_to_metal_and_ceramic_parts | molten metal]] into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Creating the Silicone Mold
1.  **Preparation**: Place the original part in a small box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
2.  **Material**: Use a two-component silicone rubber mold-making material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This specific type of silicone rubber does not stick to anything, eliminating the need for mold release agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
3.  **Pouring and Curing**: Mix the two components and cover the part with the silicone rubber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Allow it to cure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
4.  **Detail Replication**: The process can copy details down to a molecular level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, similar to how LP records were replicated with nanometer-level modulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The mold's flexibility allows for easy removal of parts with undercuts or internal features like screw holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
5.  **Dimensional Accuracy**: While excellent for surface texture and detail, the flexible nature of silicone can lead to dimensional distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. To improve accuracy, a metal screen can be embedded within the silicone before curing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
6.  **Degassing Silicone**: Viscous materials like silicone can trap air bubbles when mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. To eliminate these, the mixed silicone must be degassed in a vacuum chamber for about half an hour until all air bubbles have exploded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The container should be tall enough to accommodate the foam that forms, which can be four times the original height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Casting a Copy
For high-quality copies without air bubbles, casting should also be done under vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

1.  **Degassing Resin**: First, degas the casting resin (e.g., polyester, epoxy, polyurethane) in a vacuum chamber before pouring it into the mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Fill the container to less than a third of its height to allow for bubbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Leave it under vacuum until bubbles collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
2.  **Vacuum Casting**:
    *   Place the mold inside the vacuum chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   Use a feed tube: one end in the degassed resin, the other in the mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. A guard around the mold can prevent overflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   Start the vacuum in the chamber, which will suck the resin into the mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
    *   Once the mold is full, pinch off the feed tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
    *   Release the vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This causes any tiny air bubbles introduced during the filling process to collapse and disappear because they contain very little air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
3.  **Curing**: Remove the feed tube, turn on the heater, and cure the resin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Curing temperatures typically range from 50 to 80 degrees Celsius, though silicone may require 100 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
4.  **Finishing**: Resin can be dyed to any desired color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. The surface finish of the replica may have lower gloss than the original depending on the resin and mixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

### Advanced Molding Techniques
*   **Two-Part Molds**: For parts with features on multiple sides, a two-part mold can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This involves pouring a second layer of silicone and incorporating registration pins to ensure proper alignment of the two halves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Feed and air escape holes are added to fill the enclosed mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Inserts and Fillers**: Metal inserts (e.g., for threads) can be placed into the mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Fillers like finely chopped carbon fiber can be mixed into the resin, or carbon fiber can be laid into the mold and then impregnated with resin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Impregnation**: The vacuum process is ideal for impregnating materials like electrical coils with resin to make them waterproof and durable, as it ensures resin fills everywhere air would normally be trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

### Metal Casting with Silicone Molds
Silicone molds, especially high-temperature red silicone, can withstand very high temperatures for short periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Materials**: Molten zinc alloy parts can be poured into these molds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Some aluminum alloys can also be poured, though this will degrade the mold faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. A common zinc-aluminum alloy used for die casting can produce perfect parts when cast in silicone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Mold Durability**: A silicone mold can produce hundreds of plastic parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, but typically only around ten metal parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

When working with lathes, understanding the proper use of self-centering chucks, particularly for different stock shapes, can significantly improve accuracy and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Types of Self-Centering Chucks

There are two primary types of self-centering chucks commonly available for lathes:
*   **Three-jaw self-centering chucks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Four-jaw self-centering chucks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

[[advantages_of_using_keyless_chucks_and_four_jaw_chucks | Four-jaw chucks]] are generally considered superior because they can effectively grip square stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. They also cause less distortion to the workpiece since the gripping force is distributed across four jaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Gripping Hexagonal Stock

While many individuals opt for three-jaw chucks to grip hexagonal stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, a surprising and highly effective technique involves using a [[advantages_of_using_keyless_chucks_and_four_jaw_chucks | four-jaw chuck]] for hexagonal material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

The key insight is that any hexagon inherently has four points equidistant from its center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. By gripping a hexagon in a [[advantages_of_using_keyless_chucks_and_four_jaw_chucks | four-jaw chuck]], the workpiece can be held with virtually no runout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Demonstration of Accuracy

To illustrate this, a cleanup cut can be performed on a hexagonal piece held in a four-jaw chuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. After this initial cut, an electronic dial gauge would show zero runout, as the piece was machined in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

The true test of the [[advantages_of_using_keyless_chucks_and_four_jaw_chucks | four-jaw chuck's]] ability to grip hexagonal stock accurately comes from removing the workpiece and then re-chucking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. When re-chucked, the runout should be minimal, primarily reflecting the chuck's inherent repeat accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. For such chucks, the repeat accuracy is typically around 30 microns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

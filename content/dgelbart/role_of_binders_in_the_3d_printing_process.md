In a novel method for [[introduction_to_metal_3d_printing | 3D printing]] metal and ceramic objects, binders play a critical role, fulfilling multiple functions essential for the process's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This method, developed by Rapidia, utilizes a "cast to center" approach, involving the conversion of [[choosing_and_using_plastics_in_prototyping | SLA]] [[challenges_of_using_plastics_in_prototyping | plastic]] parts into metal or [[process_of_converting_sla_printed_parts_to_metal_and_ceramic_parts | ceramic parts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

## Functions of the Binder

The binder is crucial for several aspects of the [[casting_processes_for_plastics_and_metals | casting]] and [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering]] process, needing to perform four primary functions simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>:

1.  **Holding the Green Part Together**
    The binder provides the "green part" (the unfired, molded object) with sufficient strength for handling after it's removed from the mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>. Without it, the part would be too weak and could break, especially delicate features or those with undercuts, during demolding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:29">[01:26:29]</a>.

2.  **Preventing Ice Crystal Formation**
    When the metal powder slurry is frozen in the mold, ice crystals can form, which would significantly degrade the strength of the part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The binder contains special ingredients to inhibit this formation, ensuring the frozen part maintains immense strength due to its composite nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>, similar to how carbon fiber strengthens epoxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>. This strength allows for demolding of complex parts with undercuts and cross-holes without damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

3.  **Reducing Surface Tension**
    The binder reduces the surface tension of the slurry, which facilitates the release of air bubbles and ensures good wetting of the mold cavity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. This is vital for achieving a high-resolution, bubble-free part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. Unlike common surface tension reducers like alcohol, the binder achieves this without depressing the freezing point or significantly weakening the frozen strength of the part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:44">[03:00:44]</a>.

4.  **Enhancing Shear Thinning**
    Shear thinning is a property where a material's viscosity decreases significantly under shear conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. The binder enhances this, allowing the slurry to flow easily and fill every cavity in the mold when vibrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. Once vibration stops, the viscosity increases rapidly, preventing metal particles from sinking to the bottom, which would otherwise lead to a density gradient and distortion in the final part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

## Binder Composition and Availability

The binder used in this process is water-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a> and contains less than 1% solids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. It is typically PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. For crude experimentation, about 2% by weight of white wood glue (polyvinyl acetate) can be used, though it won't yield the same high performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

Due to the complexity of formulating a binder that performs all four critical functions effectively, Rapidia makes the specialized binder available to users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. While not expensive, its precise chemistry is vital for achieving good metallurgy and high-quality parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. The minimal binder content also means no debinding step is required before [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

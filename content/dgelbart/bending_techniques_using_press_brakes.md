A [[press_brake_machine_and_its_components | press brake]] is a machine used for bending sheet metal. It is commonly set up with different sections for various operations: one side for regular bends, another for [[custom_tooling_for_bending | custom bends]] and [[custom_tooling_for_bending | custom tooling]], and a third side for flattening or "undoing" wrong bends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Operation and Setup
To initiate a bend, the machine uses a digital gauge, though some models may have a manual gauge that functions just as effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The desired bend is entered, and the machine adjusts accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Correcting Bends
While a bend can be "undone," it is challenging to achieve a perfectly flat result again due to the enormous pressures required to make the metal flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If a perfect undo is required, the metal must be annealed, which involves heating it to red hot, for instance, with a butane torch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Without annealing, simply flattening a bend will leave a visible ridge or mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Even a 100-ton press struggles to completely remove this mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This difficulty arises because the metal work-hardens during the initial bend, making it harder to flatten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Tooling and Dies
### Goose Neck Tool
A common tool used in [[press_brake_machine_and_its_components | press brake]] operations is the goose neck tool, which has a distinctive profile unlike the simple V-shape of regular tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Its advantage is its ability to create narrow channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Generally, with a [[press_brake_machine_and_its_components | press brake]], a U-bend can only be made if it is wider than its depth to prevent interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, a goose neck tool allows for the creation of narrower channels, such as a 10x10x10 mm channel, where the last bend can wrap around the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This is particularly useful in prototyping where many parts are small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Tools for Deep Channels
For creating deeper channels, a custom tool with a hole can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. These tools can be fabricated by cutting a long bar with a [[combining_water_jet_cutting_with_presswork | water jet]] into various lengths (e.g., 1-inch, 2-inch, 3-inch pieces) or a strategic combination to achieve any desired dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The tool with a hole specifically allows for bending a "very deep U" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, meaning the bent part can be deeper than it is wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Radius Tools
To create a radius bend instead of a sharp angle, a piece of scrap metal can be bent first and then used to give a radius to the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Alternatively, a set of dedicated radius tools is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. These tools often have magnets to help them stick to the [[press_brake_machine_and_its_components | press brake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Material and Capacity
The maximum thickness of metal that can be bent depends on its width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. A 24-ton [[press_brake_machine_and_its_components | press brake]], for example, can bend full widths of about 12 gauge steel (a bit under 3 mm) when using a specific die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. If a wider V-die is used, thicker materials can be bent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Three parameters influence the bending capacity:
1.  Material thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
2.  Material width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
3.  Die opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>

To avoid constantly changing tools, it's advisable to consistently use a 3/4 inch die, which allows for bending relatively thick material in narrow sections and 2.5 to 3 mm thick steel on full width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Aluminum can be bent to greater thicknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Adjustments and Modifications
### Front Adjustment for Angles
Standard [[press_brake_machine_and_its_components | press brakes]] typically have a rear adjustment for bending angles less than 90 degrees, which can be inconvenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. A useful modification is to add a front adjustment, which consists of an air valve that shuts off the air when the desired depth is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This allows for simple adjustment of angles other than 90 degrees by regulating the air flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Table for Narrow Strips
A table, which can be homemade or purchased, is useful for bending very narrow strips of material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. When bending narrow pieces, it can be difficult to ensure squareness if only one stop is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. A table with marks allows for proper alignment of the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Sliding Tube for Fingers
A significant modification for the [[press_brake_machine_and_its_components | press brake]] involves the fingers that hold the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. While narrow fingers are needed for narrow bends, wide fingers provide stability when the part is far from the beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. A useful modification is to narrow the original round bar fingers and then place a sliding tube over them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This tube stops flush with the narrowed bar, allowing the part to be pushed all the way in for narrow bends (as the tube slides back), while still providing a wider resting area for longer parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Making Brackets
Brackets are very common parts made using [[bending_techniques_and_considerations_for_metal_enclosures | bending techniques]].
*   **Simple Right Angle Bracket:** A basic bracket can be formed by bending a piece of metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. If it's flimsy, a separate brace can be bent and spot-welded to it, ideally held against a square for accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Triangular Stiffener:** Another method involves using a triangular stiffener piece with two bent sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This piece is inserted into the bracket and spot-welded, and since the triangular piece itself is bent square, no additional square is needed for alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Ribbed Bracket:** For stiffer brackets, particularly when space is limited, a rib can be bent into the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This is achieved by leaving a space between two segments on the [[press_brake_machine_and_its_components | press brake]] and inserting a hardened steel blade with a rounded top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. The blade should be flush with the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. As the bend is made, the blade simultaneously creates a rib, which provides immense stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Dan Gart has developed a scratch-built, very high precision lathe and grinder capable of cutting, turning, and grinding parts to a tolerance of one micron (40 millionths of an inch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This level of [[Understanding and Detecting High Accuracy Parts | accuracy]] is essential for applications requiring components that exhibit frictionless movement and lifelong durability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Applications of High Precision

A prime example demonstrating the need for such precision is a cylinder and piston assembly made on this machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The piston achieves a complete sliding fit within the cylinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. When the air vent is sealed, the assembly becomes completely airtight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Due to its accuracy, if spun, it rotates freely as if on ball bearings, acting as a self-acting air bearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This means a bearing made with this [[Techniques for Measuring and Ensuring Precision in Mechanical Parts | precision]] would never require lubrication or wear out because there is no physical contact between the inner and outer parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Such parts come out of the machine ready for use, eliminating the need for time-consuming lapping processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Machine Construction and Features

This machine is a full [[Manual and CNC operation of precision machines | CNC]] system, with the hardware built from scratch and the software customized by engineer James Midley from Vancouver, BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. A standard software package could not be used due to the machine's dual functionality as a lathe and grinder, along with other specialized features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Chuck Design

The chuck features an unusual design based on an extinct American design by Skinner Chuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Its unique property is that it remains completely watertight at any jaw opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This is achieved through drive pins that operate the jaws, with the slot covered by the jaw itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Designed for very small loads, the chuck can grip parts using inserted pins for both inner diameter (ID) and outer diameter (OD) work without needing to change jaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. These pins provide a very wide gripping range, allowing the chuck to hold anything from zero to about 200 mm in diameter, in addition to its regular gripping range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Additionally, the chuck has runout adjustment screws, enabling the operator to zero the runout to a reference surface, which is useful when removing and replacing a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Tailstock

The tailstock also operates on air bearings and has a very long travel, extending about 300 mm from its fully retracted to fully extended position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This extended travel allows for a very long center distance on a small lathe, providing almost 600 mm of center distance when the center is inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Air Bearings

All moving parts of the machine, including the saddle, cross-slide, main spindle, and grinding spindle, float on air bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. The air bearings for the main and grinding spindles are surplus units from semiconductor machinery, which are very economical to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Cross-Slide and Grinding Capabilities

The cross-slide has sufficient travel to accommodate both lathe tooling and the grinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. It supports internal grinding; the grinding wheel can be removed to attach internal grinding mounts such as collet adapters for internal wheels or direct-mount threaded internal grinding wheels for more rigid applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. These internal grinding wheels are often made to suit specific jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. They can be easily fabricated by cutting any desired size from a used grinding stone with a water jet cutter and then bonding it with epoxy onto a shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This method provides access to the full range of wheel materials available for external grinding wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Achieving Micron Accuracy

Achieving one-micron accuracy requires an extremely stable bed and precise spindles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. While the spindle air bearings can be sourced as surplus, the bed itself is constructed from granite parallels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. These granite bars have all four sides parallel to a micron over their entire length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

The bed is built by bonding these granite bars with epoxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The process involves bonding one bar to another to form a T-section, and then two of these T-sections are bonded to form the bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. During the gluing process, the entire assembly is flipped upside down on a granite table with very accurate spacers placed inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Once the epoxy cures, the top and bottom surfaces become co-planar, and the internal gap is accurate to a micron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

The glue joints are held under compression by large bolts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This is crucial because while epoxy is very strong in pure shear mode, it is weak in other modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. By keeping the parts under compression, the epoxy is only subjected to shear stress (which tries to cut the parts apart), while all other stresses are absorbed by the compression from the bolts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Other Features

*   **Manual Mode:** The lathe can also function as a manual machine with digital readouts, providing a backup if the software encounters issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Built-in Microscope:** A built-in microscope allows for magnified viewing of small work directly on a display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Operation Demonstration

The machine can perform tasks like cutting threads, with the magnified cutting action visible through a video camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. It also demonstrates multi-pass grinding, with a small coolant flow that minimizes splashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

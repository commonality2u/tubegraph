This article explores the utility and characteristics of keyless chucks and four-jaw chucks, particularly in the context of precision machining on lathes.

## Keyless Chucks

Keyless chucks are preferred over key chucks for several reasons, primarily due to their accuracy and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Advantages
*   **Accuracy** Keyless chucks are generally more accurate than traditional key chucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Time-saving** They save a significant amount of time by eliminating the need to search for a key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, and by allowing for quick insertion and removal of tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Self-tightening** These chucks are self-tightening; as drilling occurs, the chuck naturally tightens itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This feature is useful in a [[general_purpose_drill_mill_setup | general purpose drill mill setup]] but also important for lathe applications involving drilling.

### Disadvantages
*   **Self-opening in reverse** A significant disadvantage is that keyless chucks are self-opening when run in reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Tapping operations** When performing tapping operations, the chuck must be tightened very hard to prevent it from opening when the tap is reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Four-Jaw Chucks

While most lathes are typically equipped with a three-jaw universal chuck, a four-jaw chuck is often a better choice for R&D and most precision work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Comparison with Three-Jaw Chucks
Three-jaw chucks are common in regular shops for handling hexagonal work, such as making fittings from stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. However, it is possible to grip hex stock in a four-jaw chuck without runout, as four points around the hex form a square, allowing for stable gripping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Advantages
*   **Square parts** Four-jaw chucks can securely grip square parts, which is very useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Reduced distortion for thin-walled parts** When gripping round parts with thin walls, four-jaw chucks cause much less distortion because pressure is applied at four points instead of three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Recommendation** It is highly recommended to equip all lathes with a four-jaw chuck for improved versatility and precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

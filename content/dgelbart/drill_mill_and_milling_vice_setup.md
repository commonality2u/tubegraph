A general-purpose drill mill is an essential machine for a workshop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Vise Setup
It is convenient to set up a drill mill with both a milling vice and a drilling vice simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   The drilling vice is quick-acting, which saves time, but it is not stiff enough for [[Milling with Ball Nose and Regular Cutters | milling]] and will loosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   A separate, stiffer vice is required for [[Milling with Ball Nose and Regular Cutters | milling]] operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   There is typically ample room on the machine for both vices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Modifications and Accessories
Several [[modifications_for_milling_machines | modifications]] and accessories can significantly enhance a drill mill's functionality and efficiency:

### Depth Adjustment Nut
The standard depth adjustment often takes a long time to turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A worthwhile [[modifications_for_milling_machines | modification]] involves drilling a hole through the nut at a slight angle. This allows the nut to be turned for fine positioning or tilted and slid for large adjustments, saving considerable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Variable Speed Drive (VFD)
It is a must to replace any belt drive unit with a step pulley system with a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. A VFD provides a very wide range of speed control without needing to physically change pulleys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This is particularly important for tasks like tapping, where precise speed reduction is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Digital Readout
A digital readout is standard and very useful today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Laser Center Finder
A highly useful accessory, which unfortunately cannot be purchased pre-made, is a laser center finder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This device, made from a laser pointer head, battery, and a slightly adjusted lens, clips onto the chuck or collet shank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   It projects a circle of light where the center of the circle is the axis of the spindle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   This allows for easy and precise alignment (up to 50 microns) with marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, holes, or pins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   When lining up with a boss, the ring of light around it is highly sensitive to misalignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   For cross-drilling, centering is achieved when the light is broken evenly at both ends of the object, forming a "V" on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   This tool typically needs to be custom-made, for instance, using a water jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Standardizing Collet Size
It is desirable to standardize on one collet size (e.g., 3/4 inch) for all tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This means the chuck, boring bars, and chosen [[Milling with Ball Nose and Regular Cutters | milling]] cutters should all have shanks compatible with this single collet size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This standardization allows for instant switching between [[Milling with Ball Nose and Regular Cutters | milling]], [[Drilling Holes Accurately | drilling]], and boring operations, saving time and avoiding constant collet changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Note that [[Milling with Ball Nose and Regular Cutters | milling]] cutters should not be used in a drill chuck as it is not rigid enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Keyless Chuck
Using a keyless chuck is highly recommended over a key chuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   Keyless chucks are generally more accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   They are self-tightening, meaning they grip tighter as the machine drills, even if not fully tightened manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This [[drill_press_time_saving_techniques | saves a lot of time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   The main disadvantage is that they are also self-opening if run in reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. When tapping, the chuck must be tightened very hard to prevent it from opening when the tap is reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Lathe Chucks and Enhancements
While this article focuses on drill mills, chuck choices are broadly applicable to machining, and a video camera enhancement is also mentioned for machine tools.

### Four-Jaw Chuck vs. Three-Jaw Chuck
For R&D and precision work, it is often a mistake to use the common three-jaw universal chuck on a lathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. A four-jaw chuck is much better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   Many people associate three-jaw chucks with hexagonal work, but a four-jaw chuck can grip hex stock without runout because a hex shape has four points that form a square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   A four-jaw chuck allows gripping square parts, which is very useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   When gripping round parts with thin walls, a four-jaw chuck applies pressure at four points instead of three, resulting in much less distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   It is highly recommended to equip all lathes with a four-jaw chuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

### Video Camera for Tool Tip Viewing
A very useful enhancement for a lathe, applicable to other machine tools, is to mount a video camera to view the tool tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   This makes intricate operations like threading on complex parts much easier by allowing clear viewing of the tool approaching the part and precise alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   With approximately 100x magnification, it is easy to see errors of a few microns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   The cheapest way to acquire such a system is to buy a car rear-view camera kit, which includes a display and camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   This kit would require a different housing and adjustment of the lens distance to achieve the desired magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. The entire setup costs around $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

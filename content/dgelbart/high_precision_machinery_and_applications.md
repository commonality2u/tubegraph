Dan Gelbart's shop and lab are structured into four distinct zones, including a dedicated high-precision area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This area houses specialized equipment designed for extreme accuracy in manufacturing and measurement.

## Key High Precision Machines

### Moor Number 3 Jig Borer
The Moor Number 3 jig borer is described as an "amazing machine" due to its exceptional precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Accuracy:** It is accurate to about 1 micron, or 40 millionths of an inch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This precision applies to all aspects of the machine:
    *   Orthogonality (squareness) of the three axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
    *   Straightness of motions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
    *   Calibration of micrometer lead screws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
    *   Trueness of rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Certification:** Each machine comes with a test certificate traceable to the National Institute of Standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. For example, lead screws might show an error of half a micron for X and Y, with the book explaining that slight warming during use tends to nullify this error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **[[Materials and construction methods for precision machinery | Design Considerations for Precision]]:**
    *   The headstock is made of Invar, a metal that does not change size with temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   Everything is properly heat-shielded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
    *   Workers performing the final scraping wear aluminized aprons to prevent body heat from distorting the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Affordability:** Despite their original cost of eighty to a hundred thousand dollars, these machines can now be purchased on eBay for about two to three thousand dollars, which is "more or less the price of the steel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Precision Measurement and Alignment Tools
To work with micron-level accuracy, specialized tools are essential:

*   **Video Microscope:** A video microscope is a useful accessory for the jig borer to locate features to one micron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. It provides a thousand-times magnified view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
    *   **Rotation Method:** The most reliable method to align a target (like a speck of dust or a hole center) to the machine's axis of rotation is to rotate the microscope. By minimizing the runout in X and Y, the machine's axis of rotation can be precisely aligned with the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This allows for [[Techniques for precise hole drilling and reaming | drilling holes]] through targets as small as five microns in diameter to one-micron accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

*   **Precision Rotary Tables and Dividing Heads:** These devices offer "amazing accuracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
    *   **Two-Axis Optical Rotary Table:** This table features an optical readout, similar to a theodolite, for tilt and rotation, achieving an accuracy of about one to two arc seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   **Ultrax:** Considered the "most accurate thing in the world in terms of dividing accuracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, made by A. Gauge and Moore.
        *   **Mechanism:** It uses two phase gears with 360 teeth that can mesh every one degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Through repeated meshing, high spots wear out, leading to an averaging of 360 positions, achieving high accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
        *   **Independence from Bearings:** Unlike systems that rely on encoders or bearing accuracy, the two phase gears of the Ultrax define the center of rotation, preventing errors from bearing wander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This allows it to achieve an accuracy of a tenth of an arc second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
        *   **Accuracy Analogy:** A tenth of an arc second is equivalent to lifting the end of a kilometer-long steel bar by one millimeter, or a mile-long bar by a sixteenth of an inch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### General Precision Area Equipment
The general precision area includes standard tools enhanced for high accuracy:
*   Granite table with gauges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   Granite square, accurate to sub-micron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   Autocollimator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   Electronic gauges and capacitance gauges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   Air bearing lathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   Watchmaker's lathe with specialized collets and gripping arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## Precision Lathe Modifications
A wireless lathe in the CNC area has been modified to enhance its precision capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

*   **Video Microscope for Tool Alignment:** A homemade video microscope, built from a car rearview camera kit, is used for aligning tool tips, especially when re-cutting threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. It provides at least 100x magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Adjustable Chuck for Runout Removal:** A custom-built chuck allows for the removal of runout without releasing the workpiece, a significant time-saver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
    *   **Mechanism:** A standard self-centering four-jaw chuck is mounted on a ground and lapped steel plate, which sits between two other ground and lapped steel plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Eccenters can move the entire chuck without losing rigidity, as the plates are very massive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
    *   **Accuracy:** This system allows for accuracy limited only by the lathe's bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, surpassing the accuracy of a collet (which is about two to three microns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. It can eliminate runout at any point along a long bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

## Shop Infrastructure for Precision
The shop itself is built to support high-precision work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>:
*   **Foundation:** It rests on 250 tons of concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   **Climate Control:** The three separate rooms have different air pressures. The room with the most dust and humidity has the lowest air pressure, while the clean room (testing lab) has the highest, ensuring dust and humidity move towards the dirty room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Doors have air filters to maintain this pressure differential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## Other High Precision Processes and Equipment

*   **Inert Gas / Carburizing Atmosphere Oven:** This homemade oven is designed for heat-treating steels without oxidation or decarburization (loss of carbon from the surface) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.
    *   **Method:** It drips methanol (methyl alcohol) at a rate of five to ten drops per minute into the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. Above 400Â°C, the methanol decomposes into a mixture of gases that act as a reducing agent (removing oxide) and add carbon to the steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.
    *   **Functionality:** It has a hot zone and a water-filled cold zone, allowing parts to be moved between them without opening the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>, ensuring parts cool completely in an inert atmosphere.

*   **Fluidized Bed Coater:** This system is used for critical coating applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.
    *   **Mechanism:** Powder inside the coater is made to behave like a liquid by pumping air through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.
    *   **Advantage:** When a hot part is dipped into the fluidized powder, the powder melts and adheres to it, coating both the outside and, crucially, the inside of hollow parts like pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. This prevents internal rusting, a common issue with traditional powder coating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

*   **High Temperature Furnace for Ceramics:** A blue furnace is used for sintering ceramics like aluminum oxide or zirconia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. These materials are essential when parts need to withstand very high temperatures or act as electrical or thermal insulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. Parts are machined in a soft state and then sintered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.

*   **Laser Welder:** A "surprisingly useful machine" for precise welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.
    *   **Versatility:** Can weld almost any metal to any other metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
    *   **No Inert Gas:** The weld occurs so quickly (milliseconds) that the metal doesn't oxidize, eliminating the need for inert gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.
    *   **Microscope Viewing:** Work is viewed through a microscope, and the laser beam is coaxial with the visible light, allowing welding in deep holes or hard-to-reach areas as long as they are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.
    *   **Applications:** Used for welding small items or temporarily attaching things, like securing nuts to screws with a tiny weld that can be sheared if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>. It's superior to Loctite for high-temperature, corrosive, or radiation environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

*   **Diamond Wire Saw:** This machine functions like a bandsaw for cutting glass and ceramics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. It's useful for optics work, such as slicing lenses or cutting prisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>. Homemade, many of its parts were cut on a water jet cutter and then lightly machined for accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>.

*   **Network Analyzer (HP 3577A):** While typically used for RF work, this instrument also has mechanical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.
    *   **Functionality:** It can perform all functions of a spectrum analyzer (useful for balancing rotating machinery by visualizing vibrations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.
    *   **Advanced Capabilities:** It can measure transfer functions of servo systems and plot characteristics of high-speed actuators, showing phase and magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.
    *   **Specs:** It measures down to about a microvolt, covers a huge range from 5 Hz to 200 MHz, and measures phase to a fraction of a degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.
    *   **Cost-Effectiveness:** These sophisticated, one-generation-old instruments, which originally cost tens of thousands, can now be bought on eBay for around $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>.

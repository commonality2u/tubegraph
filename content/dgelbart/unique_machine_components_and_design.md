This article details the design and unique components of a scratch-built, very [[high_precision_cnc_lathe_and_grinder | high precision lathe and grinder]] capable of cutting, turning, and grinding parts to a tolerance of one micron (40 millionths of an inch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This [[homemade_equipment_and_modifications | machine was built from scratch]], with custom CNC software developed by engineer James Midley of Vancouver, BC, due to its specialized features as both a lathe and grinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Necessity of High Precision

Such a high level of [[high_precision_machining_techniques | accuracy]] is required for various jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. An example is a cylinder and piston set, where the piston slides freely within the cylinder, yet creates a completely airtight seal when the air vent is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. When spun, the piston rotates frictionlessly, akin to a self-acting air bearing, due to the lack of contact between the inner and outer parts, meaning it would never require lubrication or wear out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Parts achieving this level of fit can be produced directly from the machine without time-consuming lapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Machine Components and Design Philosophy

The machine incorporates several unique [[design_philosophy_and_aesthetics_for_functional_parts | design choices]] and [[precision_and_adjustability_in_mechanical_components | precision components]].

### Chuck Design

The chuck features an unusual design based on an extinct American Skinner Chuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Its unique characteristic is its ability to remain completely watertight at any jaw opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This is achieved through drive pins that move the jaws, with the slot covered by the jaw itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
Given the lathe's design for very small loads, parts can be gripped using pins inserted into the chuck, allowing for ID or OD gripping without changing jaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. These pins provide a wide gripping range, from zero to about 200 mm diameter, in addition to the regular gripping range of the jaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
The chuck also includes a run-out adjustment feature, allowing for the run-out to be zeroed, which is highly useful when re-chucking a job to a reference surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Tailstock

The tailstock is also mounted on air bearings and has a very long travel of about 300 mm, from being fully retracted to fully extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This enables a very long center distance for a relatively small lathe, offering almost 600 mm of center distance when the center is inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Air Bearings

All moving parts of the machine, including the saddle, cross-slide, main spindle, and grinding spindle, float on air bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. The air bearings for the main spindle and grinder spindle are the only components not made from scratch; they are surplus units from semiconductor machinery, acquired economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Cross-slide and Grinding Capabilities

The cross-slide has sufficient travel to accommodate both lathe tooling and the grinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. It can be moved forward for lathe operations or back for grinding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The grinding wheel is removable, allowing for internal grinding mounts to be attached, such as collet adapters for internal wheels or direct-mount internal grinding wheels threaded onto the spindle for greater rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
Custom internal grinding wheels can be made by cutting any desired size from used grinding stones using a water jet cutter and bonding them with epoxy to a shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This provides access to the full range of wheel materials available for external wheels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Machine Bed Construction

Achieving micron-level accuracy requires an extremely stable bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The bed is constructed from economically sourced granite parallels, which are granite bars with all four sides parallel to a micron over their length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The bed is formed by bonding these bars with epoxy to create T-shapes, and then two T-shapes form the bed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
During assembly, the structure is inverted onto a granite table with accurate spacers, ensuring the top surfaces and internal gap are accurate to a micron once the epoxy cures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The glue joints are held under compression by large bolts to ensure [[strength_versus_stiffness_in_mechanical_design | strength]] and stability. Epoxy is strong in pure shear but weak in other modes; thus, compression bolts prevent other stresses, allowing the epoxy to only experience shear forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Additional Features

*   **Manual Operation**: The lathe can also be used in manual mode with digital readouts, providing a backup if software issues occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Built-in Microscope**: A convenient built-in microscope allows for magnified viewing of small work, displayed on an external screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Demonstrations

The machine is capable of [[basics_of_machining_techniques | cutting threads]] with precision, visible via a magnified video feed of the cutting action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. It can also perform multi-pass grinding operations, with a small coolant flow to minimize splashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

This session focuses on safety, particularly highlighting [[unexpected_hazards_of_woodworking_machines | unexpected safety hazards]] beyond the basic knowledge of machine operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It is crucial to always adhere to the [[safety_rules_in_workshops | specific rules of the workshop]] you are working in, such as mandatory goggles or steel-toed shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Hammering and Chiseling

When using hand tools, the primary hazard often arises during hammering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

*   **Eye Protection**: Even when wearing prescription safety glasses, it is advisable to wear goggles when hammering or chiseling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Hard Steel on Hard Steel**: The fundamental rule for hammering is never to strike hard steel directly onto hard steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   Hammers have hard faces, but tools designed for hammering are made with a soft end for striking and a hard end for their working purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   The soft end will eventually deform and "mushroom" over time, requiring grinding to remove the mushroomed material to prevent pieces from falling off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *   Striking hard steel on hard steel generates immense stress, which can cause a piece of metal to fragment and fly off with enough energy to penetrate the body, similar to a bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
    *   If there is no alternative and you must indent something by hitting hard on hard, always place a piece of soft material in between the hard surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Identifying Hardened Material

If you are unsure whether a piece of steel is hardened, there are two quick methods to check:

1.  **Filing**: Attempt to file the material; a soft material will file easily, while a hardened one will resist the file, causing it to slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
2.  **Bounce Test**: Drop the material onto a known hardened surface and observe its bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. A soft material will not bounce much, whereas a hardened material will bounce significantly higher due to its elasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

Knowing whether you are dealing with hardened material is crucial to avoid striking it directly with a hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

This article provides a tour of a personal workshop and lab, highlighting various homemade, modified, and cost-effective machine tools and equipment. The workshop is divided into four main zones: a high-precision area, a general machine shop with CNC machines, a dirty work area for tasks like woodworking, sanding, grinding, and welding, and a testing lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Workshop Design Philosophy
The entire shop was built with an intentional layout, designed as a workshop from the ground up, utilizing 250 tons of concrete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Practical features include garbage cans integrated into the floor for easy sweeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The three separate rooms have different air pressures, with the dustiest and most humid room having the lowest pressure, and the clean room having the highest. This design ensures dust and humidity migrate towards the dirty room, with air filters in the doors further maintaining air quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## High Precision Area
The high precision area features a Moor Number Three Jig Borer, noted for its accuracy of about 1 micron (40 millionths of an inch) across all axes, motion straightness, lead screw calibration, and rotational trueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Its test certificate is traceable to the National Institute of Standards, showing lead screw errors as low as half a micron, which are nullified by slight warming during use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The machine's headstock is made of invar, a metal resistant to temperature changes, and heat shielding is employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Even the final scrapers wear aluminized aprons to prevent body heat from distorting the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Due to a declining industry, these machines can be acquired cheaply today, often for the price of their steel, despite costing $80,000-$100,000 new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

A useful accessory for high-precision work is a video microscope, essential for locating features like edges or hole centers to within one micron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. By rotating the microscope, the true axis of rotation of the machine can be found and aligned with a target, allowing for one-micron accuracy drilling on objects as small as five microns in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Rotary tables or dividing heads are also vital, with an optical readout two-axis rotary table accurate to one to two arc seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. An "Ultra Dex" model, made by A. G. Davis Gauge or Moor, achieves an accuracy of a tenth of an arc second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This exceptional accuracy is due to two face gears with 360 teeth that mesh at every degree. Repeated meshing wears out high spots, averaging positions and negating the need for a perfectly true bearing, as the gears themselves define the center of rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Other precision tools include a granite square, autocollimator, electronic and capacitance gauges, and an air bearing lathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. A watchmaker's lathe is also mentioned for its specialized collets and gripping arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## General Machine Shop Area
The owner describes starting his first workshop 50 years ago with zero money, building most machines himself, beginning with a table saw, drill press, and lathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Homemade Sheet Metal Brake
One of the first machines built was a sheet metal brake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Constructed from a 4-inch by 0.5-inch cold-rolled steel bar and another 0.5-inch by 1.5-inch bar, the components were hand-cut, drilled, welded, and then case-hardened, ensuring its longevity and like-new appearance 50 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The design features a clamping mechanism with two eccentrics coupled by a belt, allowing the clamping blade to move in and out to adjust for different material thicknesses and bend radii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Homemade Spot Welder
A spot welder was built from leftover steel bars used for the sheet metal brake, with its sides and top also constructed from the same 4-inch by 0.5-inch bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. In a "bootstrapping" style, the part with the rails was built first, and then used to spot weld the housing for the rest of the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

### Lathe Modifications
The lathe, a Wirelas model, has several useful modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Video Microscope**: A very cheap and simple video microscope, built from a car rearview camera kit, is used to align the tool tip, especially for re-cutting threads, providing at least 100x magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Custom Chuck for Run-Out Removal**: A significant [[specialty_tools_and_equipment_modification | modification]] is a chuck that allows for the removal of run-out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Unlike commercially available "grip-through" chucks that shift when clamped, this design uses a standard self-centering four-jaw chuck mounted to a ground and lapped steel plate. This plate sits between two other large, rigid ground and lapped steel plates, allowing the chuck to be moved by eccentrics without losing rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This enables adjustment of run-out to the accuracy of the lathe's bearings, even for long bars, without reclamping, making it more accurate than a collet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

### Mill Modifications
A small Jet mill, primarily used as a drill, also features several [[modifications_for_milling_machines | adaptations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. These include a laser center finder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, a depth stop with a sliding nut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>, and a milling vise with retractable stops to support workpieces without needing blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. The entire tooling setup is standardized on a 3/4-inch collet, meaning all tooling (e.g., boring bars) has a 3/4-inch shank, eliminating the need to change collets frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

### Specialty Hardware Inventory
The workshop maintains a comprehensive inventory of specialty hardware not easily found in regular stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. This includes weldable hardware like standoffs, nuts, and pins for use with a spot welder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. Miniature rivets and eyelets, down to the tiniest sizes, are stocked for electronics and small-scale work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. For model building, scale screws are available, which have head proportions similar to large bolts, unlike standard small screws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Other examples include cut nails (which look better than pressed nails) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>, low-head and ultra-low-head socket screws, and undercut flat head screws for thin sheet metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Bendable metal strips, found in Japan, serve as reusable alternatives to tie-wraps for electrical wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

### Anvil Sound Dampening
A helpful tip for anvils, which tend to "ring like a bell" due to their hardened steel construction, is to laminate two lead sheets to the sides with contact cement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. This significantly dampens the ringing, making the use of [[safe_use_hand_tools | ear protection]] less critical while maintaining the anvil's proper bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

## Dirty Work Area
This area is equipped for various heavy and messy operations, featuring a Jones & Shipman surface grinder and an OMAX [[creating_custom_springs_and_minimizing_machining_using_water_jet | waterjet cutter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. It also includes various sanders, grinders, and a combination table saw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

### Homemade Furnaces and Ovens
A series of furnaces or ovens, mostly homemade, are used for heat-treating steels, powder coating, and similar processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.
*   **Early Oven with Analog Controller**: The first oven, built 50 years ago with limited funds, features a repurposed old airplane instrument as a temperature controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.
*   **Inert Gas/Carburizing Oven**: This oven is designed to prevent oxidation and decarburization (loss of carbon from the surface) during steel hardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Traditionally done with vacuum ovens, this version uses a trick: dripping methanol (methyl alcohol) into the oven at about 5-10 drops per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. Above 400 degrees Celsius, the methanol decomposes into a mixture of reducing and carburizing gases, ensuring parts emerge shiny with no carbon loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. Specifically for air hardening tool steels, this oven has a hot zone and a water-jacketed cold zone, allowing parts to be moved between them via a "boat" without opening the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Opening the oven after cooling produces a blue flame from residual methanol vapor, which is decorative at this size but could be dangerous if scaled up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>.
*   **Induction Heater**: A surprisingly inexpensive induction heater (around $1000 new) is used to quickly heat steel bars for brazing, bending, or forging in seconds, much faster than a torch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.
*   **Fluidized Bed Coater**: For more critical coating applications than traditional powder coating, a fluidized bed coater is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. Powder inside the coater is made to behave like a liquid by pumping air through it. When a hot part is dipped, the powder melts and adheres, coating both the outside and inside of hollow parts like pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. This is crucial for items like lawn furniture, which rust from the inside if not coated there, as regular powder coating only covers the exterior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.
*   **High Temperature Ceramic Oven**: A high-temperature furnace for sintering ceramics (e.g., aluminum or zirconia) is used for parts requiring high temperature, electrical insulation, or thermal insulation, which are machined in a soft state and then sintered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.

## Testing Lab / Clean Room
This room serves as a testing lab and can function as a clean room due to positive air pressure and air filters in the doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

*   **Laser Welder**: A laser welder, though not cheap (around $20,000), is highly useful for welding almost any metal to any other metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. The weld occurs so quickly (milliseconds) that oxidation is prevented, eliminating the need for inert gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. It allows welding in deep holes because only the laser beam needs to reach the target, visible through a coaxial microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. It's also used for temporary attachments, like securing nuts to screws with a weak weld that can be sheared off if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>. This method is superior to Loctite for high-temperature, corrosive, or radioactive environments, as the weld is made of the same metal and unaffected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.
*   **Miniature Spot Welder**: A smaller version of the main spot welder is used for miniature scale work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.
*   **Homemade Laser Cutter and Engraver**: While commercially available models are now inexpensive, a homemade laser cutter and engraver is also present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.
*   **Homemade Diamond Wire Saw**: This machine is specifically designed to cut glass and ceramics, functioning like a bandsaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. It includes accessories like a chuck for holding and rotating glass to cut round discs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. Many of its parts were initially cut on the [[creating_custom_springs_and_minimizing_machining_using_water_jet | waterjet]] and then finely machined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>.
*   **Cost-Effective Test Equipment**: The lab is equipped with one-generation-old electronic test equipment, primarily for RF work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>. While newer models have LCD screens, these older HP machines are preferred for their simplicity, reliability, and extreme cost-effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. For example, a HP 3577A network analyzer, originally costing tens of thousands of dollars, can be bought on eBay for about $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. This allows for replacement rather than repair if a unit fails, making it a highly cost-effective way to equip an electronics lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>. These network analyzers can measure transfer functions of servo systems and plot actuator characteristics, making them useful for mechanical work involving high-speed actuators and [[materials_and_construction_methods_for_precision_machinery | balancing rotating machinery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.

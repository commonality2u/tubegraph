The waterjet cutter, particularly an OMAX 2654 model, is identified as a key machine for prototyping. It is the most expensive piece of equipment needed, costing about ten times more than a [[cnc_plasma_cutter_as_an_alternative | CNC plasma cutter]] and having ten times the operating cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. While a [[cnc_plasma_cutter_as_an_alternative | plasma cutter]] is less versatile, only cutting metals and not all equally well, a waterjet can cut practically anything up to 2 inches thick (or more) and produces beautiful cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

To improve productivity and usability of a waterjet cutter, several modifications are highly recommended.

## Key Modifications

### 1. Sliding Basket
The most important modification is the addition of a sliding basket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Small parts, and sometimes even large ones, can unexpectedly tip over sleds and fall into the waterjet's tank, which is filled with discarded garnet. Once a part drops into the tank, it is essentially lost and very difficult to retrieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

The basket rests on the bottom part of the U-beam that holds the sleds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. It must be positioned about 8 inches (20 cm) below the top of the sleds to prevent it from being cut by the jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The basket can be moved by a pulley, allowing users to pick it up, take it out, find lost parts, and recover metal slugs that can be reused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

For thin sheet metal, parts can sometimes be left hanging by a tab and broken off. However, for anything thicker than about 1/8 of an inch, this method is ineffective, making the basket essential to save time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### 2. Laser Pointer for Beam Alignment
A very desirable modification is to have a way to know where the waterjet beam will hit the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. A laser pointer that shines through the beam path of the jet is an effective solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. While a homemade version is demonstrated, it is anticipated that OMAX Corporation may make this available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

This laser pointer is precisely made to fit exactly where the feed tube goes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. To keep the nozzle clean from water, it is plugged into an air supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The laser spot shows precisely where the jet will hit the metal because it travels through the same feed tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

An additional benefit of this laser pointer is that the shape of the spot can indicate the wear of the mixing tube, allowing users to know when to replace it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This tool is particularly important when:
*   Stopping a job and needing to restart cutting from the exact point where it left off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   Mixing precision holes with waterjet-cut holes, requiring registration of the cutting to pre-existing features like bolt holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### 3. Improved Splash Guard
The cap used to guard against splashes can be significantly improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The best splash guard found is half of a tennis ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This is superior to standard supplied caps because it takes up very little space, allowing the nozzle to get close to the edge of the material, and can be easily flipped over to observe the cutting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### 4. Custom Clamps
Adding custom clamps is another good modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. These clamps can be easily tightened down and are themselves cut on the waterjet, making them quick to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. They are designed to clamp material from 0 to 1 inch thick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Thicker materials (over 1 inch) are typically heavy enough that clamping is not necessary, as they sit securely due to their own weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Complementary Tool: Air Plasma Cutter
While not a modification to the waterjet itself, an air [[cnc_plasma_cutter_as_an_alternative | plasma cutter]] can be a very inexpensive and useful complementary tool, especially when working on [[specialty_tools_and_equipment_modification | specialty tools and equipment modification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

A plasma cutter is very light, requiring only compressed air and regular household power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Although a waterjet cutter might be preferred for most tasks, a [[cnc_plasma_cutter_as_an_alternative | plasma cutter]] is invaluable for cutting holes in large [[designing_enclosures_using_waterjet_cutting | enclosures]] or components (e.g., car parts, cabins) that are too big to fit into the waterjet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Using a Plasma Cutter with Templates
To cut a well-defined hole with a plasma cutter in a large object, a template can be made on the waterjet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This template should be oversized to account for the plasma cutter's nozzle diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The template is then clamped to the workpiece, and the plasma cutter is used to follow its outline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

It is advisable to insulate the plasma cutter tip to prevent it from electrically touching the template and to maintain a small distance from the material being cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. A machined ceramic cap is ideal, but wrapping electrical tape around the tip can suffice for quick jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

Plasma cutters are capable of cutting up to 1/4 inch steel (or 3/4 inch with larger models), stainless steel, and aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. However, they cannot cut non-metallic materials, copper, or materials that conduct heat away very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
When using a plasma cutter, safety goggles with UV filtration are essential due to sparks and intense UV emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

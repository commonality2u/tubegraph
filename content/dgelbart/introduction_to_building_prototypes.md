This short course, presented by Dan Galbart, focuses on how to build physical prototypes quickly and efficiently, primarily for students, scientists, and researchers who may not have formal machinist training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The emphasis is on using equipment that is easy to master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While applicable to some limited production, its greatest benefit is for [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | prototyping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Core Principles and Technologies

The enabling technology that simplifies the [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | prototyping]] process is [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet cutting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The course covers the [[overview_of_materials_for_prototype_building | basic setup]] of tools and machines, desired modifications to enhance productivity, and step-by-step fabrication of parts, starting with simple enclosures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Applications of Waterjet Cutting in Prototyping

[[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | Water jet cutting]] offers a wide range of advantages for fabricating parts:

### Enclosures
Commonly, [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet cutting]] is used for creating enclosures, from simple boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Captive Hardware** For R&D work, designs can incorporate captive hardware, meaning no screws are needed to hold covers, which can snap into place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This avoids the common problem of screws falling into sensitive machine parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Knockouts and Keyholes** Just like electrical boxes, knockouts can be pre-cut to avoid later drilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Keyholes are preferred over regular holes to save time, as they allow parts to be removed without fully unscrewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. These features come at no additional cost when using a [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Lightweight and Strong Designs** Parts can be embossed to achieve [[design_considerations_for_lightweight_structures | lightweight]] yet strong structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Ribs can be added quickly using a dye made from two spot-welded pieces cut on the [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Efficient Bending** A key [[design_philosophy_and_aesthetics_for_functional_parts | design philosophy]] is to construct boxes from U-shaped pieces rather than bending a single piece on all four sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This allows bending on a brake without needing to adjust segments, saving several minutes per bend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Flexures
[[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | Water jet cutting]] is ideal for creating flexures, which can be monolithic or made from spring materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Monolithic Designs** Flexures can be very tiny, such as a four-axis positioner for fiber optics, offering X and Y movement along with tilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Spring Material Integration** Flexures can be made from sheet metal with spot-welded springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Nitinol, a shape memory alloy, can be used for springs to achieve a very large elastic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Cross-Spring Hinges** These act like normal hinges but are entirely spot-welded with Nitinol flexures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Advantages over traditional slides include no wear, no lubrication, no backlash, and significantly lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Large Structures
The [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet]] is also effective for [[creating_lightweight_structures_with_a_press | creating large structures]] and complex assemblies from individual elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Springs
[[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | Water jet cutting]] allows for the fabrication of various types of springs:
*   **Solid Steel Springs** Springs can be carved directly from solid, hard steel, or cut in an annealed state and then hardened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This is useful for springs requiring significant compression force, which would be difficult to wind from thick wire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Disc Springs with Spirals** Intricate disc springs with spirals can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. These springs can compress completely flat, reducing clearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Programmable K-Function Springs** By varying the width of the spiral, the spring's stiffness (K) can be designed to be non-constant (e.g., progressive K) or even linearly tapered for a constant K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This enables the creation of springs with arbitrary force-versus-distance functions, offering a wide dynamic range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### Minimizing Machining
For parts requiring higher accuracy than a [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet]] can provide, the process minimizes subsequent machining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>:
*   The entire part is [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet]] cut, then painted, clamped, and only the precise surfaces are touched up on a machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This is faster than traditional masking and cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. In some cases, 95% of the work is done by [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet]], with only a small rim machined afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Complex Assemblies
Even complex assemblies can be broken down into simple, waterjet-cut components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>:
*   **Modular Construction** A gearbox, for example, can be constructed like simple enclosures from spot-welded, bent metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Bearing mounts can be small inserts attached with screws for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Integrated Components** Gearing can be done with internal timing belts and slip rings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Advanced Chucks** A chuck that grips at different diameters can be made almost entirely from [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet]] parts, combining a pipe and a pressed ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. The internal scroll, which activates the arms, can be a [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | water jet]] cut helix with a flexible steel strip inserted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This avoids the time-consuming process of machining, hardening, and grinding a single steel piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

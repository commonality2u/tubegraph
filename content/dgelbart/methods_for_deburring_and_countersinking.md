After drilling a hole, it is good practice to deburr and countersink it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This removes any rough edges (burrs) that may have formed during the drilling process.

## Deburring and Countersinking Exterior Holes

You can deburr a hole using a countersink tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Another option is a dedicated tool specifically designed for deburring holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

If a drill leaves a large burr, it often indicates that the drill itself was not sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Such a large burr should ideally be removed with a countersink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Deburring Interior or Hard-to-Reach Holes

Sometimes, a hole needs to be deburred from the inside, such as when drilling into a pipe or a box where external tools cannot reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. For these situations, a specialized tool resembling a wood chisel can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

This tool is typically sharpened at a dull angle, around 80 to 90 degrees, and may have a slightly rounded edge for convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. To deburr, you position the tool inside the hole, almost parallel to the surface but at a slight angle, and tap it with a hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This action shears off any burrs on the inside of the hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

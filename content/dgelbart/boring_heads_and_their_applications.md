Boring is a machining process used to create holes, comparable in accuracy to [[techniques_for_precise_hole_drilling_and_reaming | reaming]], but offering variable sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. It is particularly suitable for large holes where it might be difficult to find a reamer of the required size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

## When to Use a Boring Head

Boring heads are utilized in several specific scenarios:
*   **Special-sized holes** When a reamer of the desired size is unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.
*   **Blind holes** Reamers cannot be used for blind holes because they are slightly tapered and require going all the way through to achieve accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. Boring heads are ideal for these applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
*   **Step holes** Boring allows for machining a hole with steps, rather than requiring a continuous through-hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.
*   **Large holes** They are especially useful for creating large holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
*   **Precision shaft fit** A bored hole can provide a nice fit suitable for a shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>, similar to a [[techniques_for_precise_hole_drilling_and_reaming | reamed hole]] for a dowel pin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.

## Rigidity and Setup Considerations

Unlike [[techniques_for_precise_hole_drilling_and_reaming | drilling]] or [[techniques_for_precise_hole_drilling_and_reaming | reaming]], boring involves a single-point cutting action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. This means there's no balancing force (like the two flutes of a drill that cancel out forces) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.
*   **Machine rigidity** Due to the single-point cutting action, the rigidity of the machine is extremely important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.
*   **Minimizing deflection** To prevent deflection, everything on the machine must be adjusted for maximum rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. This includes:
    *   Locking the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.
    *   Minimizing the tool overhang by raising the table as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.
    *   Ensuring everything is tight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

## Operation

1.  **Initial Hole**: Start with a preliminary hole, often created with a [[basics_of_drilling_and_center_punching | center drill]] for rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>, followed by an undersized drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
2.  **Adjust Diameter**: The boring head allows for precise adjustment of the cutting diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.
3.  **Cutting Speed**: For materials like [[differences_between_aluminum_alloys_and_their_applications | aluminum]], a faster speed can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.
4.  **Multiple Passes**: It's beneficial to make multiple passes, going back and forth once or twice, to remove any chatter or flagships from the tool and achieve a clean finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.

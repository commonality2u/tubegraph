When [[choosing_and_using_plastics_in_prototyping | working with materials]] other than metals, such as [[choosing_and_using_plastics_in_prototyping | plastics]] and ceramics, in R&D and prototyping, specific properties and challenges arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Polycarbonate (Lexan) Properties and Limitations

Polycarbonate, commonly known by the trade name [[challenges_of_forming_lexan_plastic | Lexan]], is a widely used engineering [[choosing_and_using_plastics_in_prototyping | plastic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It is highly valued for being shatterproof and ductile, allowing 3/16" polycarbonate to be bent like sheet metal without breaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. While it does exhibit some spring-back (e.g., a 90° bend might spring back slightly, but can be compensated by bending sharper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, its primary disadvantage in construction is its inability to hold threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This is because the material is too weak for direct threading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Solutions for Threading

To overcome the threading limitation, two main methods are employed:
*   **Threaded Inserts:** These inserts are set like pop rivets, providing a robust thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Helicoils:** If space is limited for inserts, Helicoils—small metal springs that form a thread—can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Once a Helicoil is threaded into a plain hole, it provides an excellent thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## General Instability and Thermal Expansion of Plastics

After addressing threading, [[choosing_and_using_plastics_in_prototyping | plastics]] are very usable, similar to metals, but require a few precautions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. A significant challenge is that most [[choosing_and_using_plastics_in_prototyping | plastics]], unless heavily filled with fibers or other materials, are unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Key instabilities include:
*   **Humidity Absorption:** All [[choosing_and_using_plastics_in_prototyping | plastics]] absorb humidity and change with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Temperature Sensitivity:** They soften with increasing temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Thermal Expansion:** [[choosing_and_using_plastics_in_prototyping | Plastics]] possess a much larger thermal expansion coefficient than metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. While metals typically have coefficients between 10 and 23 parts per million (PPM) (e.g., steel ~11, aluminum ~23), [[choosing_and_using_plastics_in_prototyping | plastics]] range from 50 to 150 PPM—almost an order of magnitude more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Consequences of Thermal Expansion

This large expansion can be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. For instance, if a plastic sheet is bolted to a metal sheet at its corners and exposed to sunlight, the [[choosing_and_using_plastics_in_prototyping | plastic]] will expand and buckle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. An expansion of 100 PPM over a meter results in 0.1 mm per degree Celsius, meaning a 10°C temperature change can lead to 1 mm of expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This significant expansion is a major concern for stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Mitigation Strategies

While avoiding [[choosing_and_using_plastics_in_prototyping | plastics]] is sometimes preferable due to these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, they are indispensable for applications requiring heat insulation, electrical insulation, or transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. To manage thermal expansion in large sheets, it is recommended to mount one side with a fixed screw and the other with a slot and washer, allowing the material to expand freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

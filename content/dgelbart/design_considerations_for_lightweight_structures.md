When designing and fabricating lightweight structures, particularly for prototypes or limited production, several techniques leveraging tools like water jet cutting can be employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The emphasis is on building items quickly using easily mastered equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Enhancing Strength and Lightness
To achieve both lightweight and strong parts, especially for enclosures or components, [[Creating lightweight structures with a press | embossing]] can be utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Embossing Ribs**: Ribs can be quickly put into sheet metal using a die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This die can be fabricated in about one minute using a water jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The die itself is typically made of two pieces spot-welded together after being cut on the water jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Adding these ribs makes the structure lighter while maintaining strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Efficient Assembly Design
Designing components for ease of fabrication contributes to efficient production of lightweight structures:
*   **U-Shaped Piece Construction**: For boxes and enclosures, a common design approach is to construct them from U-shaped pieces rather than bending a single piece on all four sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This means a box might consist of a large U-shape and two smaller U-shapes spot-welded together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This method simplifies the bending process on a brake, as it avoids the need to move segments or adjust the brake fingers, saving time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Utilizing Water Jet for Diverse Structures
Water jet cutting is an enabling technology that simplifies many fabrication processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Large Structures**: Water jet cutters are particularly well-suited for creating very large structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Complex assemblies can be fabricated from elements cut using this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Combining Materials**: When a thicker section is required within an otherwise lightweight assembly, it can be added on or welded to the structure and then machined if necessary after the main fabrication is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Minimizing Machining for Complex Parts**: For complex components, the water jet can significantly reduce the need for extensive machining. For example, a chuck that grips at different diameters can be made entirely from water jet cut parts, including a pipe and a ring pressed together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Even internal scrolls that activate arms can be created by water jet cutting a helix and then inserting a flexible steel strip, which is more efficient than grinding a single, complex piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

Spot welding aluminum on conventional transformer-based [[spot_welding_basics_and_setup | spot welders]] is generally considered nearly impossible [00:11:40].

## Challenges with Conventional Spot Welders
The primary reason conventional [[spot_welding_basics_and_setup | spot welders]] struggle with aluminum is that aluminum conducts heat too well [00:12:01]. Specialized capacitive discharge [[spot_welding_basics_and_setup | spot welders]] exist that can weld aluminum due to their very fast discharge [00:11:48]. However, for most shops using transformer-based machines, a direct weld attempt on aluminum typically results in the pieces coming apart immediately [00:12:11]. This highlights a key challenge in [[material_compatibility_with_spot_welding | material compatibility with spot welding]].

## The Sandwich Method for Aluminum Spot Welding
An effective trick for [[spot_welding_basics_and_setup | spot welding]] aluminum using a conventional [[spot_welding_basics_and_setup | spot welder]] involves a "sandwich" technique [00:12:21]. This method was shared by a YouTube viewer who learned it from an experienced individual [00:12:23].

### Materials Needed
*   Two pieces of aluminum to be welded [00:12:44].
*   Two pieces of steel or, preferably, stainless steel [00:12:46], as stainless is slightly better [00:12:52].

### Procedure
1.  Place one piece of stainless steel down [00:12:56].
2.  Lay the first piece of aluminum on top of the stainless steel [00:12:58].
3.  Place the second piece of aluminum (the one to be welded to the first) on top [00:13:01].
4.  Cover the aluminum pieces with the second piece of stainless steel, effectively sandwiching the aluminum between the two stainless steel sheets [00:13:06].
5.  Proceed with the [[spot_welding_basics_and_setup | spot welding]] process as usual [00:13:14].

### How it Works
In this indirect [[spot_welding_basics_and_setup | spot welding]] method, the stainless steel itself gets hot enough to melt the aluminum, forming a small puddle that creates the weld [00:13:35]. The stainless steel does not stick to the aluminum [00:13:21]. This technique results in a strong weld where the aluminum pieces are nicely joined [00:13:24].

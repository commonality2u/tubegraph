While a [[effective_use_and_limitations_of_shop_presses | press]] can be very useful for various tasks, it is considered one of the most dangerous machines in a [[workshop_safety_rules | shop]] due to its deceiving appearance [00:00:28]. Understanding and adhering to safety precautions is paramount.

## Dangers of Stored Energy and Shattering Materials
When a piece of steel is compressed, it stores a significant amount of energy [00:00:37]. If the material being pressed is brittle, it can suddenly shatter, releasing all this stored energy at once [00:00:43]. This release can be extremely violent; for example, a block of steel compressed near its strength limit can store more energy than a bent truck spring and, if it shatters, can release energy "much more than a cartridge from a rifle," capable of instantly killing a person [00:01:00].

Due to the Poisson ratio, forces are not only vertical but also sideways, causing pieces to fly like shrapnel in all directions upon shattering [00:01:36].

> [!warning] Never Press Hardened or Brittle Materials
> The first rule of a [[effective_use_and_limitations_of_shop_presses | press]] is to never compress a hardened or brittle piece of material [00:01:48]. Doing so guarantees it will store energy and, if it shatters, will fly like a hand grenade, posing a severe risk of injury or death [00:01:54], [00:04:04].

Even when working with ductile materials, there's always a risk that the tooling or the [[effective_use_and_limitations_of_shop_presses | press]] itself might be hardened [00:02:04].

### Essential Safety Shield
To mitigate the risk from flying shrapnel, it is highly recommended to use a shield made of half-inch polycarbonate [00:02:15]. Polycarbonate is shatterproof, providing a crucial barrier [00:02:21].

> [!tip] Shield Usage
> Anything except pressing sheet metal should be done with a polycarbonate shield in place [00:02:28], [00:12:28].

## Risk of Damage to the Press Itself
Concentrating the full force of the [[effective_use_and_limitations_of_shop_presses | press]] on a very small area can damage the machine [00:02:37]. For instance, applying 100 tons of force on an area the size of a dime (or 2 square centimeters) far exceeds the yield strength of even the best steel, leading to a dent in the [[effective_use_and_limitations_of_shop_presses | press]] [00:02:47]. Most steels yield at 10-20 tons per square centimeter, meaning 50 tons per square centimeter would cause damage [00:03:02].

> [!caution] Avoid Concentrated Force
> To prevent damage to the [[effective_use_and_limitations_of_shop_presses | press]], avoid applying full force to an area less than 10 square centimeters [00:03:30]. Mistakenly applying too much force can dent or even crack the [[effective_use_and_limitations_of_shop_presses | press]] [00:03:38]. This is unintuitive, as even small pieces of plastic or wood can damage the press if the force is too concentrated [00:03:44].

When operating, it is important to center the material in the [[effective_use_and_limitations_of_shop_presses | press]] to avoid bending the [[effective_use_and_limitations_of_shop_presses | press]] frame [00:10:32], [00:15:11].

## Applications and Techniques
A [[effective_use_and_limitations_of_shop_presses | press]] is primarily useful for straightening and flattening materials [00:04:16]. Its capabilities are greatly enhanced when combined with a [[combining_water_jet_cutting_with_presswork | water jet]] [00:04:23]. A [[combining_water_jet_cutting_with_presswork | water jet]] can quickly cut custom tooling from mild steel plates, which can then be used in the [[effective_use_and_limitations_of_shop_presses | press]] to form shapes in sheet metal [00:04:28]. This process is significantly faster than using a CNC mill for complex patterns [00:07:37].

The [[effective_use_and_limitations_of_shop_presses | press]] is excellent for creating lightweight, high-performance structures by forming closed-form pieces or pressing in ribs, which increase stiffness in bending and torsion without adding significant weight [00:04:47]. Materials like 17-7 stainless steel can be formed in an unhardened state, spot-welded, and then heat-treated (aged) to achieve a high elastic range and hardness [00:06:26].

For cylindrical boxes, the [[effective_use_and_limitations_of_shop_presses | press]] can create round covers with a bent lip using male and female tooling cut by a [[combining_water_jet_cutting_with_presswork | water jet]] [00:07:57]. When making male and female tooling, a clearance of 1.5-2mm (for 1mm material) is necessary to prevent jamming [00:08:30].

### Pressing Techniques
*   **Male Tool against Rubber/Lead**: A male tool can be pressed against hard rubber or lead to create a rib [00:09:39]. Rubber needs to be bigger than the metal being pressed to prevent wrinkling [00:11:22]. This method yields a nice rib but with less sharp definition [00:11:10]. Lead can be reused by melting [00:14:23].
*   **Male and Female Tooling**: For sharper definition and deep drawing, male and female tooling is used [00:11:34], [00:13:08]. The key challenge is alignment when sheet metal is in between [00:09:58]. One method is to first press a rough shape against rubber, which then helps register the male and female halves for a second, more accurate press [00:11:37], [00:14:04].
*   **Deep Drawing**: For deep draws, the material may need to be annealed (heated to red hot and cooled) in between multiple drawing steps to prevent tearing, similar to the stamping industry [00:13:14], [00:13:46].
*   **Shearing vs. Pressing**: There's a fine line between pressing and shearing. If a tool has sharp corners and is pressed into rubber or lead, it might shear the material out, which can be useful for punching out many parts [00:14:34]. If corners are rounded, it will press; if sharp, it might shear [00:16:00].

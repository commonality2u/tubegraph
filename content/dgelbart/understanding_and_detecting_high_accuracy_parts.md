Even after finish machining, a part may appear visually appealing but lack true accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. If moving parts slide against each other, conventionally machined components can quickly wear out and develop "play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This occurs because the machined surface, despite looking beautiful, only touches another part at a few high spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Identifying Inaccurate Surfaces

To demonstrate this, one can color a machined surface with a dry-erase marker (or specialized flatness-detecting fluids) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Sliding this part against a highly accurate granite plate will show that the ink only transfers where the part actually touches, revealing only a few high spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This limited contact means that as soon as these high spots wear off, the part will become loose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Assemblies not properly made may seem accurate initially but rapidly lose their precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Achieving Full Bearing Area

For a part to maintain accuracy and prevent wear, its entire surface should touch the mating part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This "full bearing area" is critical for two main reasons:
1.  **Increased Surface Area**: More material is available to resist wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
2.  **Hydrodynamic Lubrication**: With a perfectly flat surface and proper [[the_role_of_lubrication_in_reducing_wear_in_high_accuracy_parts | lubrication]], an oil film forms, preventing metal-to-metal contact and resulting in virtually zero wear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Grinding: An Intermediate Step
Surface grinding can significantly improve machining accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This is because grinding involves much smaller forces between the cutting tool and workpiece, and less clamping force is required, reducing distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. However, even ground surfaces still only touch at a few spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Lapping
Lapping is a method to create a truly flat surface on small parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. It involves moving the part in a randomized motion on an abrasive surface, such as emery paper on a granite surface plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

*   **Process**:
    *   Clean a granite surface plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
    *   Stick emery paper (e.g., 220, 180, or 400 grit) to the plate, possibly with a drop of water to help it stick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   Lap the part in a figure-8 motion, applying uniform pressure, and occasionally turning the part over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
    *   Continue until the entire surface appears dull, indicating all machining marks are removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Checking Progress**: Initially, only a few spots will show the abrasive effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. As lapping progresses, the shiny "high spots" will spread until the entire surface is uniformly shiny, indicating full area bearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Parallelism**: Small errors in parallelism can be corrected by leaning on the higher side of the part during lapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
*   **Lapping Other Shapes**:
    *   **Holes**: Use a split lap with abrasive paper around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   **External Cylinders**: Use a split external lap with emery cloth, rotating the part in a lathe while moving the lap back and forth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
    *   Lapping requires motion in at least two directions to randomize the abrasive action and prevent grooves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Shapes like tapers are harder to lap accurately for this reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Soft Materials**: When lapping soft materials like aluminum or brass, there's a risk of abrasive particles embedding in the material, causing it to act as a permanent lap and wear down mating harder parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Special softer lapping compounds are available for these materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

### Scraping
Scraping is an alternative to lapping, particularly suitable for large or heavy parts that cannot be easily moved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

*   **Process**:
    *   Touch the surface with a known reference plate (e.g., granite) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
    *   Identify high spots, often visible by reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
    *   Remove these high spots by peeling off very thin layers of metal with a scraper tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
    *   Scrape in one direction, then the other, and re-check for high spots, repeating the process many times until the high spots are uniformly spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Tools**: Hand scrapers are used, or power scrapers for large areas, which make the process faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Appearance**: [[high_precision_machinery_and_applications | High precision machine tools]] often feature a truly scraped surface, while less precise tools might have a "fake" scraped appearance over ground marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

## Benefits of Full Bearing Surfaces
When surfaces have a full bearing area and are lubricated, they offer:
*   **Accuracy**: The part sits accurately and doesn't "walk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Stiffness**: The load is distributed, allowing the part to bear heavy loads with much higher stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
*   **Zero Wear**: Perfect planes with lubricant become hydrodynamic, preventing metal-to-metal contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This is demonstrated by hard drive spindles that lose electrical contact when spinning due to the oil film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Even air can act as a lubricant between perfectly flat surfaces, allowing frictionless movement at low speeds due to low pressure over a large area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

### Using Reference Surfaces
For simple measurements like flatness, one can rub the part against a known flat granite surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. To ensure squareness, a part can be clamped to a known accurate square reference bar (e.g., submicron accuracy) before grinding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. Parallelism can be achieved by flipping the part and grinding, then fine-tuned with hand lapping by adjusting pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

### [[reversal_methods_in_precision_instruments_and_metrology | Reversal Methods]]
In metrology, a challenge arises when measuring properties like straightness, roundness, or squareness without a perfect reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. [[reversal_methods_in_precision_instruments_and_metrology | Reversal methods]] provide a powerful principle to solve this by measuring the combined error of two unknown components and then inverting one to create independent equations.

*   **Principle**: If you have two unknown straight edges, you can measure their combined deviation using a dial gauge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. Then, by flipping one part over and measuring again, you get a second set of readings. These two sets of measurements form two independent equations (e.g., `f(x) + g(x)` and `g(x) - f(x)`), allowing you to solve for the individual straightness of each unknown component, `f(x)` and `g(x)`, even if they have an initial tilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
*   **Applications**: This concept is fundamental in separating runout from roundness when measuring a spindle, determining straightness, and accurately dividing circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

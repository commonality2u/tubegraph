When fabricating items such as [[design_and_fabrication_of_enclosures | enclosures]], a common design approach involves using U-shaped pieces rather than attempting to bend a single sheet on all four sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. This method, often enabled by [[designing_enclosures_using_waterjet_cutting | waterjet cutting]], offers significant benefits, particularly in terms of fabrication efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

## Simplified Bending Process

The primary advantage of designing with U-shaped pieces is the simplified bending process on a brake press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. When bending a single piece on four sides, it is typically necessary to adjust the brake segments (or fingers) to accommodate the part's geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. This adjustment involves finding the correct combination of brake segments, which can take an extra couple of minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

In contrast, a U-shaped piece can be bent using a full-length bar on the brake without needing to modify or adjust the brake segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. This eliminates the time-consuming step of segment adjustment, making the bending process much faster and more straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

## Assembly and Fabrication

Complex [[design_and_fabrication_of_enclosures | enclosures]] can be efficiently designed as a combination of multiple U-shaped pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. For example, a box might be constructed from one large U-shaped piece and two smaller U-shaped pieces, which are then spot welded together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This modular approach leverages the ease of bending individual U-shapes to create more intricate assemblies. However, it's important to note that a piece that is too deep cannot be bent on a brake without interfering with the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Keyless Chucks
Keyless chucks offer several benefits for general-purpose drill mills and similar machines. They are convenient to set up with a drilling vice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, providing quick action and saving a significant amount of time compared to traditional key chucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Key advantages include:
*   **Accuracy** Keyless chucks are generally more accurate than key chucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Self-Tightening** They are self-tightening, meaning that as a drill operates, the chuck will tighten itself even if not fully secured initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This feature significantly contributes to [[drill_press_time_saving_techniques | time savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Self-Opening in Reverse
> The primary disadvantage of a keyless chuck is its self-opening nature when run in reverse. If performing tapping, the chuck must be tightened very hard to prevent it from opening when the tap reverses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Four-Jaw Chucks
For R&D and most precision work, it is highly recommended to equip a lathe with a four-jaw chuck rather than a three-jaw [[lathe_self_centering_chuck_usage | self-centering chuck]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Key advantages of a four-jaw chuck include:
*   **Hexagonal Stock Gripping** Contrary to common belief, a four-jaw chuck can grip hexagonal stock without runout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This is because four points around the hex form a square, allowing for stable gripping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Square Part Gripping** It is very useful for gripping square parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Reduced Distortion** When gripping round parts with thin walls, a four-jaw chuck causes much less distortion compared to a three-jaw chuck, as it distributes pressure across four points instead of three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

> [!TIP] Universal Recommendation
> It is strongly advised to equip all lathes with a four-jaw chuck for improved precision and versatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

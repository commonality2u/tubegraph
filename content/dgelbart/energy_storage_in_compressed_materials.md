Presses, while useful for various tasks, are considered one of the most dangerous machines in a shop due to the significant energy they can store in compressed materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Danger of Stored Energy
When a piece of steel is compressed, it stores a considerable amount of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. If the material is brittle, this energy can be suddenly released if it shatters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Consider a large truck spring bent in two; if it snaps open, it can kill a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, a block of steel of the same weight, compressed near its strength limit, stores more energy than a bent truck spring because the spring is not stressed to its limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. A piece of steel of the same weight compressed with 100 tons, if it shatters, can release energy equivalent to, or greater than, a rifle cartridge, and can instantly kill a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Shrapnel Risk
When steel shatters due to compression, the forces are not just vertical but also sideways, a phenomenon influenced by Poisson's ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This causes pieces to fly like shrapnel in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Never press a hardened or brittle piece of material, as it will store up energy and, if it shatters, can explode like a hand grenade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Even when compressing ductile materials, the tooling used may be hardened, presenting a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Safety Precautions
To mitigate the risks associated with energy release, it is advisable to provide a shield made of half-inch polycarbonate, as polycarbonate is shatterproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Anything other than pressing sheet metal should ideally be done with such a shield in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Press Damage from Concentrated Force
It's crucial to understand that applying the full force of a press onto a very small area can damage the press itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For example, concentrating 100 tons onto an area the size of a dime (approximately 2 square cm) far exceeds the yield strength of even the best steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Most steels yield at around 10-20 tons per square cm, so applying 50 tons per square cm will dent the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

A 100-ton press should ideally not be loaded with more than approximately 10 tons per square cm, taking a safety factor into account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Therefore, one should not press anything with an area less than 10 square cm, as applying more force by mistake could dent or even crack the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This means even compressing a small piece of plastic or wood can damage the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Applications of Presses
While a press is primarily useful for straightening and flattening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, its true potential is unlocked when combined with a water jet cutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This combination allows for rapid cutting of custom tooling from mild steel plates, which can then be used in the press to form shapes in sheet metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

This method is particularly valuable for [[creating_lightweight_structures_with_a_press | creating lightweight structures with a press]] that are high-performance, such as for airborne applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. To achieve stiffness in [[design_considerations_for_lightweight_structures | lightweight structures]], using closed-form pieces is effective, similar to how cars gain rigidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. For instance, pressing ribs into a flat metal strip significantly increases its moment of inertia, improving [[strength_versus_stiffness_in_mechanical_design | strength versus stiffness in mechanical design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Closed shapes offer superior torsional strength compared to open bends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

For truly high-performance [[overview_of_materials_for_prototype_building | structures]], certain stainless steels, such as 17-7 stainless, which can be heat-treated after forming without quenching, are ideal [[materials_used_for_flexures_and_their_properties | materials used for flexures and their properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. These materials can be pressed into shape, spot-welded, and then hardened through a temperature cycle in an oven, resulting in a very high elastic range that allows them to spring back after bending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

This press-and-water-jet method is much faster than CNC milling for creating complex patterns, as it avoids clamping and other setup concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Another application is creating cylindrical boxes with round covers that have an upturned lip for spot welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Tooling for this can be cut from a water jet, providing both male and female dies simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. A crucial detail for such tooling is to ensure sufficient clearance (e.g., 1.5-2 mm for 1 mm thick material) to prevent jamming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### Pressing Techniques
Two primary methods for pressing shapes:
1.  **Male tool against rubber or lead**: The male tool presses the material into a hard rubber or polyurethane backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Lead can also be used and is reusable by melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. This method typically produces shapes with less sharp definition but is often sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. The rubber or lead must be larger than the metal piece to prevent wrinkling of edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
2.  **Male and female tooling**: Once a rough shape is established (e.g., from the first method), this shape can serve to register and align male and female dies, allowing for much sharper and more accurate definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

For deep drawing, it's often necessary to anneal the material (heat it red hot and let it cool) between draws to prevent tearing, especially with complex shapes or significant depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

### Pressing vs. Shearing
The distinction between pressing and shearing is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. If the male tool has sharp, unrounded corners and is pressed into a softer material like rubber or lead, it can actually punch out (shear) the part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This is useful for producing many identical parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. A tool with sharp corners can sometimes result in shearing on one side and pressing on another, depending on the uniformity of the corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

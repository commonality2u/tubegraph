Brazing relies on flux to achieve successful and strong joints. Flux is a crucial component in the brazing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Purpose of Flux

The primary functions of flux in brazing are:
*   **Wetting the metal:** Flux allows the brazing filler metal to spread and flow over the base metal surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Dissolving oxides:** It breaks down and removes existing oxides on the metal surfaces, which would otherwise prevent proper bonding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Protecting from oxidation:** During the heating process, flux creates a protective barrier that prevents new oxides from forming on the metal surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Without flux, brazing would not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Fluxes are generally inexpensive compared to brazing wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Types of Flux

There are typically two main types of flux used in brazing:

### White Flux
*   **Composition:** Primarily borax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Applications:** It is the most common flux used for all non-ferrous metals and can also be used on iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. For example, white flux can be used on brass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Black Flux
*   **Composition:** Believed to be a fluoride salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Applications:** This type is more aggressive than white flux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a> and is specifically used for stainless steel and other harder-to-braze materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Application of Flux

Flux usually comes in a paste consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. To apply, it can be filled into corners where the braze joint is desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, or applied everywhere on the joint area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The goal is to create a small fillet with the flux where the braze fillet is intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Excess flux is generally not a major problem, as it cleans up easily after the brazing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. However, it's advisable to wipe off excess flux for cosmetic reasons, as the flux can slightly attack the metal surface at high temperatures, potentially causing surface defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. The brazing wire should be partially buried in the flux for optimal results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

If brazing in multiple steps or on different planes, it is important to fill all gaps with flux to prevent oxidation, even if they won't be brazed in the current step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

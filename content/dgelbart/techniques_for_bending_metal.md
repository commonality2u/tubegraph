The press brake is a machine primarily used for bending metal, with various setups allowing for regular bends, [[customization_and_tooling_for_precision_bending | custom bends and tooling]], and flattening operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Basic Bending Operation
To bend a piece of metal, the machine is set up using a digital or manual gauge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The desired bend is input, and the machine adjusts accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Undoing Bends (Flattening)
The press brake has a side specifically for "flattening dies," acting as an "undo button" for incorrect bends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. However, achieving a perfectly flat piece after bending is challenging due to the enormous pressures required to make the metal flow again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Simply undoing a bend without heat will leave a mark or ridge that is difficult to remove, even with a 100-ton press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

For a cleanly undone bend, the metal must be annealed. This involves heating it to red hot with a butane torch before attempting to flatten it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Metal work hardens during bending, making it harder to flatten without annealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Specialized Tooling for Bending
Different tools and [[customization_and_tooling_for_precision_bending | customizations]] can be used on the press brake to achieve specific bend types and geometries:

### Gooseneck Tool
This tool has a unique profile compared to the regular V-shaped tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Its advantage lies in allowing the bending of narrow channels (e.g., 10x10x10 mm), which would otherwise interfere with the brake's components if using a standard tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. In [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | prototyping]], where small parts are common, the gooseneck tool is preferable for creating narrow channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Deep Channel Tool
A specialized tool with a hole can be made to create very deep U-shapes, deeper than their width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. These tools are typically custom-made using a water jet to cut a long bar into segments of various sizes (e.g., 1-inch, 2-inch, 3-inch pieces) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. It's smart to cut them in a specific [[bending_order_and_techniques_for_enclosure_assembly | bend order]] to minimize the number of pieces needed for any dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Radius Bends
To achieve a radius bend instead of a sharp one, a piece of scrap metal can be bent first and then used to guide the die, creating a rounded aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Alternatively, a set of dedicated radius tools can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. It is a good idea to embed magnets in these tools to help them stick to the press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Workholding and Alignment
### Table with Marks
For bending very narrow strips, a table with alignment marks is useful. This allows the operator to line up the strip precisely, ensuring the bend is square even when the piece is too small to touch both stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Sliding Tube Modification for Fingers
The press brake fingers are often supplied too wide, preventing them from entering narrower than the beam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. A very useful modification is to narrow the original round bar of the finger and then put a sliding tube over it. This allows the operator to push in a very narrow tongue for narrow bends, while the tube provides a wider resting area for longer parts, preventing misses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## Bending Capacity
The thickness of metal that can be bent depends on several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>:
*   **Press Tonnage:** A 24-ton press brake, for example, can typically bend full-width gauge 12 steel (just under 3mm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Material Width:** Thicker material can be bent if it's a narrow section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Die Opening (V-width):** A wider die opening allows for bending thicker material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
To avoid frequent tool changes, it's often best to keep a 3/4-inch die installed, as it allows bending quite thick material in narrow sections and approximately 2.5-3 mm material across the full width for steel (more for aluminum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Angle Adjustment
Press brakes come with a rear adjustment for bending angles less than 90 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. However, this is often inconvenient. A more practical modification is to add a front adjustment, such as an air valve, which shuts off the air when the desired depth is reached, allowing for simpler adjustment of angles like 45 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Stiffening Brackets
When [[techniques_for_constructing_enclosures_and_flexures | constructing enclosures]], brackets are commonly used but can be flimsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Here are methods to make them rigid:

*   **Simple Brace:** A separate brace can be bent and [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | spot welded]] into place. To ensure accuracy, the brace should be held against a square during spot welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Triangular Stiffener:** A triangular stiffener piece with two bent sides can be inserted into the bracket and [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | spot welded]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. If the triangular piece itself is bent square, a separate square is not needed during welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Integrated Rib:** For very stiff brackets where space is limited, a rib can be bent directly into the bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This is achieved by leaving a space between two segments on the brake and inserting a hardened steel blade with a rounded top, positioned flush with the die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. As the metal bends, the blade presses a rib into it, providing immense stiffness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

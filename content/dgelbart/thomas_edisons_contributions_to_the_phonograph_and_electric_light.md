Thomas Edison is widely recognized for his inventions, particularly the lightbulb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## The Phonograph: A Revolutionary Invention

Edison's most original invention, which emerged without clear precedent, was the phonograph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This device marked the first time in history that a person could hear their own voice or record music for preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

The original Edison machine engraved sound onto tinfoil cylinders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Later, [[the_invention_of_the_automatic_phone_exchange_by_almon_strowger | Bell]] changed the recording medium to wax, which was more durable and easier to engrave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. The phonograph operated mechanically, using a diamond needle that followed the groove of a rotating wax cylinder, with no electrical connection for sound amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

The machine could both record and playback; the only difference was a sharper needle used for recording, which could be easily exchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Invented in 1877, just before the lightbulb, the phonograph was an instant success, with millions of cylinders produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Even today, a wide variety of music from that era remains available on Edison cylinders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## The Electric Lightbulb: Systemic Improvements

While Edison is well-known for the lightbulb, electric lighting systems, such as those by Swan in England, existed before his contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Early lightbulbs typically used metal filaments and low voltage, requiring them to be wired in series. This meant that if one bulb failed, the entire circuit would go out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

Edison's significant contribution was his understanding and implementation of a parallel wiring system for lightbulbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. He realized this was crucial for a successful electrical lighting system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. To achieve this, he focused on finding a filament with very high resistance, allowing bulbs to be plugged into a 220-volt DC system (which later became AC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Although he improved upon an existing idea, Edison's work enormously advanced the lightbulb and the broader distribution of electricity for lighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. An original Edison lightbulb used a carbon filament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

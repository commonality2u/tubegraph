A [[spot_welding_basics_and_setup | spot welder]] is a versatile machine, often homemade, used for welding sheet metal and other components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This guide covers its use, particularly for [[introduction_to_building_prototypes | prototyping]], including temporary and permanent joining techniques, material considerations, and specific applications.

## Spot Welder Setup and Operation

When operating a [[spot_welding_basics_and_setup | spot welder]], the primary adjustable setting is time, which must be carefully set based on metal thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Some machines also have a pressure setting, which should generally be set to maximum and ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The ideal power for a spot welder is between 15 and 25 KVA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. A 15 KVA unit can weld up to 3mm to 3mm (gauge 12 to gauge 12) in mild steel, and slightly heavier in stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Safety Precautions
>
> *   Wear goggles, or use glasses, as the machine sparks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
> *   Do not wear sandals; molten metal can drip and cause burns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
> *   While the voltage is low (2.5 volts), the current is very high (5,000 amps), generating significant magnetic force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>. Be aware that magnetic or metallic objects may be attracted to the electrodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.

## Testing and Calibration

To determine the correct time setting for sheet metal, perform a tear test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>:
1.  Take two pieces of metal of the same thickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
2.  Make a few welds at different time settings (e.g., 2, 3, 4 cycles for 0.7mm sheet metal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
3.  Attempt to tear the welded pieces apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
4.  A proper weld will cause the metal itself to tear, rather than the weld opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Once calibrated, it's recommended to create a chart for different materials and thicknesses (e.g., one for stainless steel and one for mild steel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. If your machine has adjustable current, always set it to the top current and adjust time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Higher current with shorter times minimizes heat escape, resulting in better welds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Material Compatibility

A [[spot_welding_basics_and_setup | spot welder]] can weld mild steel and stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. It can also weld exotic metals like tungsten, titanium, and niobium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Generally, it welds metals that do not conduct electricity well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Non-ferrous metals (e.g., copper, aluminum) cannot be welded due to their high electrical conductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

The spot welding range ends where [[advanced_welding_and_coating_processes | TIG welding]] becomes easy for thicker materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. [[advanced_welding_and_coating_processes | TIG welding]] thin materials is difficult, as it's easy to burn a hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Prototyping and Temporary Welding

A key advantage of [[spot_welding_and_repairing_errors_in_metal_prototypes | spot welders]] for [[introduction_to_building_prototypes | prototyping]] is the ability to create both temporary and permanent welds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>:
*   **Temporary Weld**: By setting a lower time (e.g., one cycle), a very weak weld is created that can be broken by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This is useful for positioning components temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Permanent Weld**: A higher, calibrated setting creates a strong, permanent bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### Correcting Welding Errors

If a permanent weld needs to be opened, especially if multiple welds are present, the only effective method is to drill it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The weld typically leaves a center mark, making it easy to use a 3-4mm drill bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Attempting to pry or twist permanent welds will likely tear the metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Welding Rods and Captive Hardware

Spot welders are very efficient for welding rods due to the small contact area and concentrated heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. A 15 KVA unit can easily weld 3/8-inch and even 1/2-inch rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. The tear test for rods involves twisting; the rod should shear before the weld opens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

Spot welders are also highly useful for attaching captive hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>:
*   **Studs and Standoffs**: These typically have a small point that fits into a pre-made mark (e.g., from a water jet cutter) for accurate positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Special hollow electrodes are needed to hold them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Standard round-head screws can also be welded in place of specialized studs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Nuts**: "Spot welding nuts" have three projections and a pilot shoulder for accurate placement into a pre-cut hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. They are welded between two flat electrodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Plain pieces of metal or washers can be welded to sheet metal to create enough thickness for tapping threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Hinges and Latches**: Many types of spot weldable hardware, including hinges and latches, are available for purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Balls**: Small metal balls can be welded to flat surfaces or the ends of rods for kinematic mounts, omnidirectional pivots, or adjustable couplings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Conical electrodes are used to hold the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## Specialty Welding Techniques

### Invisible Welds

To achieve a perfectly flat outer surface without visible weld marks (e.g., for aesthetics or cleanliness in medical devices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>:
*   Standard methods using one flat electrode often result in a slight indentation that requires extensive sanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
*   The optimal method uses a special electrode with a small, shallow dimple (a few millimeters in diameter, 50 microns deep) at the weld point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. This dimple pushes the metal out by an amount equal to the shrinkage during cooling, resulting in a perfectly flat surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.

### Welding Non-Weldable Materials

Materials like Nitinol, phosphor bronze, or beryllium copper, which cannot be easily welded or soldered, can be joined using a [[spot_welding_and_repairing_errors_in_metal_prototypes | spot welder]] by trapping them between two pieces of a weldable material, such as stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. The weld passes through the non-weldable material, joining the outer layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. For strips or wires, [[techniques_for_bending_metal | bending]] the ends of the outer layers to create a gradual radius prevents abrupt transitions and weak points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

### Watertight Enclosures

To create a watertight enclosure, spread a very thin bead of RTV silicone between the two metal pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. Then, weld through the silicone at a dense pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. The welding pressure displaces the silicone, creating a strong, watertight bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.

### Salvaging Material for Water Jet Cutting

A [[spot_welding_and_repairing_errors_in_metal_prototypes | spot welder]] can be used to salvage small pieces of material for water jet cutting. Since water jet machines cannot cut all the way to the edge due to clamping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>, a larger piece of scrap material can be attached to the small piece to provide a clamping area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. For thicker materials where a step is undesirable, the pieces can be butt-welded flush at the joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. This horizontal weld melts them together without a step, providing enough grip for the water jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

## Custom Electrodes

Many welding jobs require custom electrodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   **Material**: Electrodes are typically made of copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Copper is easy to [[techniques_for_bending_metal | bend]] and work-hardens upon bending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   **Tips**: For long-lasting tips, inserts made from copper-tungsten alloy or copper-chromium alloy are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. These can be machined with a taper and pressed into a tapered hole in the copper electrode body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.
*   **Design**: Custom electrodes can be made to reach deep into cavities, provide offsets, or hold parts at precise angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
*   **Non-Marking Electrodes**: To prevent marking on one side of a part, use an electrode with a much larger contact area on that side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. This larger area prevents it from heating up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.

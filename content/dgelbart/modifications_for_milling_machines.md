A general purpose [[drill_mill_and_milling_vice_setup | drill mill]] is a versatile machine for a workshop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is convenient to set up with both a [[drill_mill_and_milling_vice_setup | milling vice]] and a drilling vice simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While a drilling vice is quick and saves time, it is not stiff enough for [[basics_of_machining_techniques | milling]] and will loosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Therefore, a separate [[drill_mill_and_milling_vice_setup | milling vice]] is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Recommended Modifications and Accessories

Several modifications can significantly improve the efficiency and precision of a [[drill_mill_and_milling_vice_setup | drill mill]]:

### Depth Adjustment Nut Enhancement
The standard depth adjustment on many mills can be slow to turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Drill a hole through the nut at a slight angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This allows for precise turning to position the nut.
*   For larger movements, the nut can be tilted and slid, saving considerable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) Conversion
If a machine comes with a belt drive unit and a step pulley, it is highly recommended to replace it with a VFD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   A VFD is simpler and more cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   It allows for a very wide range of speed changes without manual pulley adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   This is especially important for operations like tapping, which require lower speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Digital Readout (DRO)
A digital readout (ER readout) is a standard and very useful accessory for [[drill_mill_and_milling_vice_setup | milling machines]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Homemade Laser Center Finder
A highly useful accessory that is not commercially available is a homemade laser center finder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   It consists of a laser pointer head, with the lens adjusted for focus, and a battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   It is designed to clip onto the chuck or straight onto the shank in case collets are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   This device projects a circle of light, with the center of the circle indicating the axis of the spindle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   It makes it very easy to line up the machine with a feature to be drilled, such as a mark, a hole, or a pin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   The spot size can be made larger to help find the center of a feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   For aligning with a hole or a pin, the sensitivity of the ring of light allows for alignment to within 50 microns in a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. When centering to a hole, adjust until the ring of light is horizontal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   For cross-drilling, align until the light is just broken at both ends simultaneously, forming a 'V' shape on both sides, indicating the center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   This device, often made on a waterjet cutter, offers around 50-micron precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Tooling Standardization
It is desirable to standardize on one collet size for all tooling to avoid constantly changing collets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   For example, standardizing on a 3/4-inch collet means that chucks, boring bars, and [[milling_with_ball_nose_and_regular_cutters | milling cutters]] can all share the same shank size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   This allows for instant switching between [[basics_of_machining_techniques | milling]], drilling, and boring operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Note that [[milling_with_ball_nose_and_regular_cutters | milling cutters]] should not be used in a chuck as it is not rigid enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   Adding a wheel on top of the collet chuck can eliminate the need for wrenches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Keyless Chucks
A keyless chuck is preferred over a key chuck for convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   Keyless chucks are more accurate and self-tightening, meaning they will tighten as they drill, even if not fully tightened initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   To operate, simply close it to lock and open it to release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   The main disadvantage is that if run in reverse, they are self-opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. For tapping, the chuck must be tightened very hard to prevent it from opening when reversing the tap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

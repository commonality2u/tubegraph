A [[general_purpose_drill_mill_setup | general purpose drill mill setup]] is a fundamental machine for a workshop, often benefiting from specific modifications to enhance efficiency and precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While a drilling vice is quick for drilling, it's not stiff enough for milling and will loosen, necessitating a separate milling vice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Key Modifications

### Depth Adjustment
Original depth adjustment mechanisms on these machines can be slow to turn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A worthwhile modification is to drill a hole through the adjustment nut at a slight angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This allows for quick coarse adjustments by tilting and sliding the nut, and fine adjustments by turning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) Conversion
If a drill mill comes with a belt drive unit and a step pulley, it is essential to replace it with a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. A VFD simplifies speed changes, making it possible to adjust speed over a very wide range without touching the pulley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This is particularly important for operations like tapping, which require lower speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Laser Center Finder
A highly useful accessory for a drill mill is a laser center finder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This tool, which is not commercially available and must be [[homemade_and_diy_machine_tools | homemade]], typically consists of a laser pointer head with a slightly refocused lens, a battery, and a clip to attach to the chuck or collet shank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

The laser center finder projects a circle of light where the center of the circle is the axis of the spindle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This makes it very easy to:
*   Line up the machine with a mark for drilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   Find the center of a spot by making the circle larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   Align the spindle with a hole or a pin by forming a ring around the feature; the ring's position is very sensitive to misalignment, allowing for alignment to within 50 microns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   Cross-drill by adjusting until the light is broken at both ends simultaneously, forming a 'V' shape when centered on a diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

This device can be easily made, for instance, on a [[modifications_to_improve_waterjet_productivity | water jet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Tooling Standardization
It is desirable to standardize on one collet size for all tooling, such as a 3/4 inch collet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This allows for instant switching between operations like milling, drilling, and boring without needing to change collets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Accessories like chucks and boring bars should have the same shank size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Milling cutters should also be selected with the same shank size when possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

To further simplify operations, add a wheel on top of the collet chuck, eliminating the need to search for wrenches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Keyless Chucks
When drilling, using a keyless chuck is preferable to a key chuck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. [[using_keyless_chucks_and_fourjaw_chucks_on_lathes | Keyless chucks]] are generally more accurate, self-tightening during drilling, and save time by eliminating the need for a key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. However, a disadvantage of [[using_keyless_chucks_and_fourjaw_chucks_on_lathes | keyless chucks]] is that they are self-opening when run in reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. For tapping, where reverse operation is necessary, the chuck must be tightened very hard to prevent it from opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Video Camera Magnification
Mounting a video camera, such as a modified car rear-view camera kit, on a machine tool can provide 100x magnification of the tool tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This allows for easy viewing and precise alignment, even down to a few microns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. The camera and monitor kit costs around 100 dollars and requires a different housing and lens distance adjustment to achieve the desired magnification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This modification can be applied to various [[manual_and_cnc_operation_of_precision_machines | machine tools]], not just lathes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

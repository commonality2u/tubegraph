From: [[dgelbart]] <br/> 

This article explores a novel 3D printing method developed by Rapidia, known as "Cast to Sinter," which enables the production of metal and ceramic objects with exceptionally high resolution and superior surface finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This approach leverages advancements in [[process_of_converting_sla_printed_parts_to_metal_and_ceramic_parts | SLA plastic printing]] to achieve results that surpass other [[introduction_to_metal_3d_printing | metal 3D printing]] methods in terms of detail and smoothness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Advantages of the Cast to Sinter Method

The "Cast to Sinter" method offers several significant advantages:
*   **Highest Resolution and Best Surface Finish** This method produces the highest resolution and best surface finish of any known [[introduction_to_metal_3d_printing | 3D metal printing]] method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>. It can reproduce micron-level details and intricate features like cross holes and threads perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.
*   **Mirror Finish Potential** Parts produced are already shiny and smooth, allowing for a mirror finish with simple electropolishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Traditional 3D printed parts are too coarse for electropolishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Complex Geometries** Like other 3D printing methods, it can produce parts of any complexity, including those difficult to machine, such as spiral gears with internal gears and undercuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Material Versatility** The process works with any metal or ceramic material that can be sintered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>. This includes tungsten carbide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>, alumina, and zirconia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. It is particularly well-suited for exotic materials or small quantities, such as platinum or gold, where only a few grams might be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   **Low Cost per Part** The primary cost is the metal powder, which is cheaper than filament or bound metal slurry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>. Molds are inexpensive and reusable, making the process very cheap for batch production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.

## Enabling Technology: High-Resolution SLA Printers

The "Cast to Sinter" process is fundamentally enabled by the availability of new generation, low-cost, high-resolution resin plastic printers, commonly known as [[process_of_converting_sla_printed_parts_to_metal_and_ceramic_parts | SLA machines]] or resin printers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. These UV-curable resin printers create mirror-finished plastic parts with super high resolution at a very low cost, often selling for less than $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The "Cast to Sinter" method essentially [[process_of_converting_sla_printed_parts_to_metal_and_ceramic_parts | converts these plastic SLA parts into metal or ceramic parts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## The "Cast to Sinter" Process

The process involves several distinct steps:

### 1. SLA Model Creation and Scaling
The process begins with an SLA (resin) printed plastic model of the desired part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Since converting powder to solid metal involves shrinkage, the SLA model must be oversized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. In this specific process, the shrinkage is about 19%, so the plastic model is scaled 19% larger than the final desired part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Before making a mold, the SLA model must be spray-painted with any type of paint or varnish to prevent the photopolymer resin from inhibiting the polymerization of the silicone rubber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### 2. Silicone Rubber Mold Creation
A silicone rubber mold is made from the oversized and painted SLA model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. A recommended silicone rubber, like BVDino's blue 30A durometer, is self-degassing (no bubbles after mixing) and exceptionally strong, resisting tearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The silicone parts are mixed one-to-one by volume or weight and poured over the SLA model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The mold can be ready in a few hours, or within two hours if heated to 60-80°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. For complex parts, the mold is typically cut with a knife to facilitate part removal, with marks to ensure precise realignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Despite being soft and elastic, silicone rubber maintains its shape without distortion during [[casting_processes_for_plastics_and_metals | casting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. For simpler shapes, a one-piece mold that flips inside out can be used, eliminating cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. More complex molds can be designed for injection under pressure with vents to ensure complete filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

### 3. Metal Slurry Preparation and Pouring
A metal slurry, consisting of metal powder and a specialized binder, is prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. For high resolution, finer powder (e.g., 10 to 25 micron) is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The binder, typically PVA-based, serves four critical functions:
1.  **Green Part Strength**: Holds the green (un-sintered) part together for handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.
2.  **Ice Crystal Inhibition**: Prevents the formation of ice crystals during freezing, which would degrade part strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.
3.  **Surface Tension Reduction**: Controls surface tension to ensure good wetting, bubble release, and overall mold filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.
4.  **Shear Thinning Enhancement**: Improves shear thinning, causing viscosity to drop under shear (like vibration for pouring) and increase when static, preventing metal particle settling and density gradients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.

The metal powder and binder are thoroughly mixed, typically with an electric drill and bent wire, until the mixture achieves a smooth, honey-like consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Air bubbles are removed by vibration or partial vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. The slurry is then poured into the silicone mold under strong vibration to ensure it fills every cavity and expels air bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Any leftover slurry can be used to cast a "raft," a plate of the same material placed under the object during [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering]] to prevent cracking or distortion due to shrinkage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### 4. Freezing and Demolding
The filled mold is placed in a freeze dryer, ideally pre-cooled to -40°C, and frozen for a minimum of 2 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. The key innovation here is that the frozen mixture of metal powder and water forms a composite material that is immensely stronger than ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. This composite strength allows for demolding of parts with undercuts, cross-holes, and threads without breakage or damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

### 5. Drying (Freeze Drying)
After demolding, the frozen "green part" is immediately placed back into the freeze dryer to prevent melting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. This is the longest step in the process, taking approximately 20 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

### 6. Sintering
The dried green part is then placed in a furnace for the [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering]] cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
*   **For Metals**: A vacuum [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering]] furnace (like Rapidia's) is required to convert the green part into solid metal of high quality (99% density) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. This cycle typically takes about 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   **For Ceramics**: Ceramics can be sintered in air using a much less expensive furnace (around $4,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

Before [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering]], a thin layer of alumina powder is sprinkled on the raft to prevent the part from fusing to it during the high-temperature process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. Furnaces can accommodate multiple shelves and parts, allowing for batch processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

## Cost Implications and System Setup

[[cost_implications_and_applications_of_the_novel_3D_printing_method | The cost]] of setting up this system varies significantly between ceramics and metals:
*   **Ceramics**: A full system for high-performance, high-resolution 3D printing of ceramics can cost under $10,000, primarily due to the affordability of air [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering]] furnaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
*   **Metals**: A system for metal 3D printing is significantly more expensive, costing around $140,000, mainly due to the necessity of a vacuum [[sintering_process_in_metal_3d_printing | sintering]] furnace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. Without a vacuum furnace, good quality metal parts cannot be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.

The company Rapidia owns the intellectual property for this process but makes it publicly available to encourage the sale of their furnaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. They also provide the specialized binder and metal powder to those experimenting with the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>.

## Disadvantages

While offering exceptional resolution and surface finish, the "Cast to Sinter" method has some drawbacks compared to fully automated [[introduction_to_metal_3d_printing | 3D metal printing]] systems like Rapidia's own printers:
*   **Manual Steps and Delays** The process involves many manual steps and significant delays due to freezing and drying times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>.
*   **Distortion** It exhibits more distortion than traditional 3D printed parts due to density gradients caused by metal particles settling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. While rotationally symmetric parts might have minimal distortion (30-50 microns), parts with overhangs can experience up to 1% distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. Supports must also be cast for overhangs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.
*   **Shape Limitations** It cannot produce hollow shapes or infills that cannot be [[casting_processes_for_plastics_and_metals | cast]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

Despite these disadvantages, for applications requiring the highest resolution, best surface finish, and flexibility with a wide range of exotic or small-batch materials, the "Cast to Sinter" method presents a very interesting and [[cost_implications_and_applications_of_the_novel_3D_printing_method | cost-effective]] alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

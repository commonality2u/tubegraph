When [[introduction_to_building_prototypes | building prototypes]], working with materials other than metals, such as plastics and ceramics, is common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Among engineering plastics, polycarbonate, widely known by its trade name [[properties_and_challenges_of_working_with_lexan | Lexan]], is a very useful material in R&D work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Properties of Polycarbonate (Lexan)

Polycarbonates are highly valued for their shatterproof and ductile nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. A 3/16-inch polycarbonate sheet can be bent much like sheet metal without breaking, which is a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. However, it does exhibit some spring-back; for instance, a bend intended for 90 degrees might spring back slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This can be compensated for by bending it sharper than the desired angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Challenges in Working with Plastics

Despite their benefits, [[characteristics_and_applications_of_various_plastics | plastics]] present several challenges for [[overview_of_materials_for_prototype_building | prototype building]]:

### Thread Holding
A significant disadvantage of polycarbonate is its inability to hold threads directly due to its inherent weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. To address this, designers must use threaded inserts, which are set like pop rivets, or helicoils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Helicoils are small metal springs that form a thread when screwed into a plain hole, providing an excellent and durable thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Material Instability
Most plastics are considered unstable materials unless heavily reinforced with fillers like fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This instability manifests in several ways:
*   **Humidity Absorption** All plastics absorb humidity, leading to changes in their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Temperature Softening** They tend to soften when exposed to increased temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **High Thermal Expansion** Plastics have a much larger thermal expansion coefficient compared to metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   Metals typically have expansion coefficients between 10 and 23 parts per million (PPM) (e.g., steel ~11 PPM, aluminum ~23 PPM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
    *   Plastics, in contrast, typically range from 50 to 150 PPM, which is almost an order of magnitude greater than metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   This large expansion can be problematic; for example, a plastic sheet rigidly bolted to a metal sheet at the corners will buckle when exposed to sunlight due to the differential expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. An expansion of 100 PPM over a meter translates to 0.1 mm per degree Celsius, meaning a 10-degree change can result in 1 mm of expansion, a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

The overall instability of plastics is a major consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. While it's often better to avoid them if possible, plastics are indispensable for applications requiring heat insulation, electrical insulation, or transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. When using large plastic sheets, it's advisable to fix one side with a screw and the other with a slot and washer, allowing for expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

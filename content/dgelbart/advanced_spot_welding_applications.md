Spot welders are versatile tools, capable of handling applications beyond simple sheet metal joining. They are particularly useful for [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | prototyping]], integrating captive hardware, and even welding materials typically difficult to join.

## Temporary vs. Permanent Welds for Prototyping
A key advantage of spot welding is the ability to create both temporary and permanent welds, making it very convenient for [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | prototyping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:16">[03:29:16]</a>.
*   **Temporary Welds:** By setting the welder to a lower time (e.g., one cycle), a weak weld can be made that can be easily broken off by hand or twisted off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This allows for positioning parts and adjusting hinges or covers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. It's akin to using temporary glue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.
*   **Permanent Welds:** Once satisfied with the positioning, the final welds can be made at a higher setting (e.g., two or three cycles for typical sheet metal) to create a strong, permanent bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.
*   **Correction for Permanent Welds:** If a permanent weld needs to be removed, it cannot be pried or twisted off as it will tear the metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. The only way to open it is to drill out the weld, which leaves a convenient center mark for drilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## Welding Rods and Wire
Spot welders are highly efficient at welding rods due to the small contact area, which results in high current density and minimal heat escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.
*   A 15 KVA unit can easily weld 3/8-inch rods and even half-inch rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.
*   The same tear test applies: the rod should shear without the weld opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.
*   This makes spot welding ideal for creating structures from wire, such as custom-made wire frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

## Welding Captive Hardware
Spot welders are very useful for integrating various types of captive hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.
*   **Types of Hardware:** This includes hinges, nuts, studs, standoffs, latches, and closures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. A wide range of spot weldable hardware is available commercially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.
*   **Custom Electrodes:** Welding these requires a set of hollow electrodes to accept standard screw sizes, often with a ball and spring mechanism to hold the hardware in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.
*   **Accurate Placement:** Studs often have a small "pip" or point at the end that can align with a small mark (e.g., from a water jet cutter or 1mm drill hole) on the sheet metal, allowing for accurate positioning by feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.
*   **Welding Nuts:** Special "spot welding nuts" with three projections and a pilot shoulder are available. A hole is cut for the pilot, and the nut is welded using two flat electrodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, a plain piece of metal or washer can be welded to the back of thin sheet metal to provide sufficient thickness for tapping a thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>.

## Welding Balls for Kinematic Mounts and Adjustments
Spot welding balls is useful for creating kinematic mounts, couplings, and adjustable mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>.
*   **Applications:** Balls are cheap and accurate, making them suitable for adjustments where a rod needs to move in multiple directions or for omnidirectional pivots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>.
*   **Special Electrodes:** A conical hole electrode is used to hold the ball <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>. For welding a ball to the end of a rod, a special collet adapter is used to grip the rod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>. The ball must be smaller than the hole in the electrode to allow removal after welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>.
*   **No Marking:** If there's sufficient contact area between the copper electrode and the ball, the ball will not be marked, even if it melts at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>.

## Invisible Welds
For aesthetic reasons or cleanliness (e.g., medical devices), invisible welds can be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>.
*   **Standard Method (Ineffective):** Textbooks suggest using one flat electrode and one regular electrode, but this often results in an inward pull or mark upon solidification that requires significant sanding of the entire surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>.
*   **Special Electrode Method:** The correct way is to use a special electrode with a very small, shallow dimple (e.g., a few millimeters in diameter, 50 microns deep) at the weld point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>. This dimple pushes metal outwards by an amount that compensates for the shrinkage upon cooling, resulting in a perfectly flat surface that requires minimal or no sanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>.

## Welding Difficult Materials
Some materials, like Nitinol, phosphor bronze, or beryllium copper, are difficult to weld directly because they are non-ferrous and conduct electricity well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>.
*   **Trapping Technique:** These materials can be spot welded by trapping them between two pieces of a weldable material, such as stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>. The weld passes through the outer layers and the trapped material, fusing everything together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>.
*   **Example:** A Nitinol flexure hinge, which provides zero wear and lubrication for wide-range movement, can be welded by trapping it between stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>.
*   **Preparation:** It's a good idea to bend the ends of the trapped material to create a gradual radius, avoiding abrupt transitions that could create weak points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>. The setting should be slightly higher than for just welding stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>.

## Watertight Enclosures
Spot welding can be used to create watertight enclosures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:35:00">[28:35:00]</a>.
*   **Method:** A very thin bead of silicone RTV (Room Temperature Vulcanizing) silicone is spread along the joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:41:00">[28:41:00]</a>.
*   **Welding:** The spot welds are then made through the silicone bead at a dense pitch. The welding pressure displaces the silicone, allowing the metal to weld while the displaced silicone creates a seal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:54:00">[28:54:00]</a>.
*   **Application:** This technique is useful for building gas tanks or other sealed containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:30:00">[29:30:00]</a>.

## Salvaging Material for Water Jet Cutting
Spot welding can help salvage small pieces of material for water jet cutting, especially when the clamping area limits how close to the edge a cut can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:37:00">[29:37:00]</a>.
*   **Joining Scrap:** If materials are thin, they can be stacked and spot welded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:02:00">[30:02:00]</a>.
*   **Butt Welding:** For thicker materials where a step is undesirable, two pieces can be butt-welded flush at the joint using a spot welder. This melts them horizontally, creating a smooth, strong enough joint to hold the material for water jet clamping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:08:00">[30:08:00]</a>.

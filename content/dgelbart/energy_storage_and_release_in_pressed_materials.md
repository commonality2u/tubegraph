Presses are powerful machines capable of performing many useful tasks in a shop, but they are also considered one of the most dangerous machines due to the immense energy they can store and release during operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## How Energy is Stored

When a piece of steel is compressed, it stores a significant amount of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This stored energy can be compared to a large truck spring bent in two, which can kill a person if it snaps open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. However, a block of steel compressed to near its strength limit can store even more energy than a bent truck spring, as the spring is not stressed to its maximum limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. For example, a piece of steel of the same weight, compressed with 100 tons, can release more energy than a rifle cartridge if it shatters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## The Danger of Sudden Energy Release

The primary danger arises if the compressed material is brittle or hardened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Such materials can suddenly shatter, releasing all the stored energy at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. When steel shatters, the forces are not only vertical but also sideways, due to Poisson's ratio, causing pieces to fly out like shrapnel in all directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This uncontrolled release of energy can instantly kill a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Material Considerations
A fundamental rule in [[safety_precautions_in_presswork | presswork safety]] is to never press a hardened or brittle piece of material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Doing so will cause it to store energy and, upon shattering, disperse like a hand grenade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Even when pressing ductile materials, there is still a risk if the tooling used is hardened, or if the press itself, which is hardened, is stressed improperly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Accidental compression of hardened steel is guaranteed to shatter, and the resulting shrapnel is extremely dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Safety Measures
To mitigate the risk of shrapnel from shattering materials, especially when pressing anything other than sheet metal, it is crucial to use a protective shield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. A half-inch polycarbonate shield is recommended because polycarbonate is shatterproof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Material Properties and Applications
For [[effective_use_and_limitations_of_shop_presses | high-performance structures]] requiring lightweight strength, certain stainless steels, such as 17-7 stainless, are ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. These alloys can be heat-treated after forming (without quenching) to achieve a very high elastic range, allowing them to spring back even after being bent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This process involves forming the material, spot welding, and then heat treating it in an oven to enhance its elastic properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

The ability to [[bending_techniques_using_press_brakes | press materials]] to create stiff, lightweight structures with features like ribs demonstrates the utility of presses beyond simple straightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. By pressing in ribs or creating closed forms, the moment of inertia and overall strength increase significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

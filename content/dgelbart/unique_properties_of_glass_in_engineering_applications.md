Glass possesses an unusual property that makes it invaluable for specific engineering applications, particularly in optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## Shape Retention Property
A unique characteristic of glass is its ability to maintain its prismatic shape even when heated and drawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. If a shape, such as a D-shaped cross-section with sharp corners, is ground into glass, it will retain that shape as it is drawn thinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Even when drawn to hundreds of its original diameter, a sharp corner will be retained when viewed under a microscope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

The accuracy of retaining the form is approximately one micron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, and the process is predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Any error in retaining the form is repeatable, allowing for its measurement and compensation by grinding the preform with the error included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. This enables the achievement of sub-micron accuracy after a single pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## Manufacturing Process
The drawing process must be performed in a proper oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, heating the glass gently to avoid cracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Temperature control is crucial; if the glass becomes too soft, it will flow together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. The drawn glass must also be allowed to cool properly to prevent cracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data= "00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## Applications in Optics
This unique property is indispensable for creating miniature cylindrical lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### Miniature Cylindrical Lenses
A common method involves starting with a long glass bar (e.g., one foot), which is then ground on a CNC grinder to an aspheric profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. This bar is then heated in an oven and drawn into hundreds of feet of miniature lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

These resulting lenses are nearly diffraction-limited and spherically corrected cylindrical lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. They are subsequently used in the manufacturing of special micro-lenses for lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. These drawn pieces are later cut and installed into mounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

### Other Prismatic Shapes
Beyond cylindrical lenses, this process is ideal for manufacturing other prismatic shapes, such as squares, triangles, or aspheric lenses, when precise form retention is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. This highly specialized technique is used when no other substitute exists for the required quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

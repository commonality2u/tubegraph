The process of creating a metal enclosure from design to finished product involves several steps, including cutting, bending, assembly, and finally, painting and finishing. These latter steps are crucial for the product's appearance, durability, and user safety.

## Pre-Painting Preparation

Before any paint is applied, the metal enclosure requires thorough preparation to ensure optimal adhesion and a smooth finish.

### Edge Treatment
It is important to break sharp edges on the metal to protect fingers and allow other components to lay flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Sharp edges can also cause paint to chip off, leading to an unsightly finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

### Error Correction
Mistakes made during the cutting process, such as extra or misplaced holes, can be repaired using a spot welder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. To do this, a slightly oversized piece of metal is placed over the defect and melted into the hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. After welding, the area should be cut and touched up, potentially sanded, especially if it's on the top side, as imperfections will show up after painting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Incorporating Hardware
Any studs, nuts, or other captive hardware that will be permanently integrated into the enclosure should be spot welded in place *before* painting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. Once the part is painted, spot welding is no longer possible because paint acts as an insulator, preventing electrical contact necessary for the welding process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.

### Sandblasting
After all structural and hardware components are in place, the enclosure undergoes [[methods_for_protecting_against_rust | sandblasting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. This process cleans the surface and prepares it for painting.

### Masking
Areas that should not be painted, such as threads or specific mounting points, must be covered. This can be done using silicon rubber tubes or Kapton tape, both of which can withstand the high temperatures of the curing oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. It's sometimes advisable to cover these areas even before sandblasting if abrasive treatment is undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. Threads, however, usually require cleaning after painting anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

### Hanging for Painting
To prepare for painting, the enclosure is hung using hangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. These hangers should be positioned in a way that their contact points are not visible on the finished product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. Hangers are designed to ground the part during the [[powder_coating_and_electrostatic_painting | powder coating]] process and cannot be reused once they themselves are powder-coated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

## Painting Process: Powder Coating

[[powder_coating_and_electrostatic_painting | Powder coating]] is a common method for finishing metal enclosures, known for its durability and aesthetic appeal.

### Application
The enclosure is typically painted white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. When applying [[powder_coating_and_electrostatic_painting | electrostatic paint]], the voltage may need to be reduced for inside corners (e.g., 15 kilovolts) to minimize shielding effects, while other areas can be painted at 20 to 50 kilovolts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. A proper enclosure for painting, made of non-metal, would typically minimize overspray by attracting the electrostatic particles only to the workpiece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. In a professional setup, the part would be hung on a rotating shaft for even coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.

### Curing
After paint application, the enclosure is placed in an oven for curing. The nominal curing procedure for epoxy paint involves:
*   Initial heating: 5 minutes at 235°C (approximately 380°F) to allow the paint to flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.
*   Secondary heating: Temperature is then dropped to 190°C (less than 350°F) for another 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.
*   Total cycle: The entire curing process takes approximately 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

Leaving the paint at the higher temperature for the entire duration (e.g., 275°C for 20 minutes) may cause the paint to yellow slightly, resulting in an off-white or light beige color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. The secondary heating step is crucial for "crosslinking," which provides the paint with its hardness and durability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. If the full curing time is not met, the paint will be soft even if it appears to have flowed properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

## Post-Painting Steps

Once the enclosure has cooled down from the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>:
*   **Remove Protectors:** Silicon rubber or Kapton tape protectors are removed from threads and other masked areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.
*   **Clean Threads:** Threads often accumulate dirt from spot welding and paint, so they need to be cleaned using a tap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.
*   **Defect Repair:** If there are any defects after painting, the part can be oversprayed with powder and re-hung in the oven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

## Design Considerations for Painting

When designing metal enclosures, several factors related to painting should be considered:

*   **Rounded Edges:** Recessing the cover a couple of millimeters from the edge of the main body creates a rounded edge when closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This prevents sharp edges that can cause injury or lead to paint chipping over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Hole Proximity to Bends:** If a hole is too close to a bend line (e.g., 3mm instead of 10mm), it can twist and distort during bending, especially round holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. It's recommended to keep openings at least 10mm away from bend lines to avoid distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. If a hole must be at a bend line, making it a U-shape where the flat part aligns with the bend line can help maintain its form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
*   **Integrated Components:** Design should include all necessary internal brackets, clamps, or small pieces that can be cut from the same sheet metal and painted simultaneously to ensure consistent finish and fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
*   **Captive Hardware and Keyholes:** Employing captive hardware and keyhole slots for covers and components significantly reduces assembly time and the risk of losing small parts, thereby streamlining future maintenance and preventing potential short circuits in electronic assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

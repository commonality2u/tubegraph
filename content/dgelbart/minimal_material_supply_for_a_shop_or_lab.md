For a minimal yet comprehensive supply of materials in a shop or lab, a curated selection of metals, non-metals, and other useful consumables is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Metals

### Mild Steel
[[materials_and_construction_methods_for_precision_machinery | Cold-rolled mild steel sheets]] are considered a fundamental material due to their strength, affordability, and widespread availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It is suitable for spot welding, bending, and water jet cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Recommended Gauges**: Gauge 18 (approx. 1.2 mm) and Gauge 10 (approx. 3 mm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. These two gauges can cover about 95% of building needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   Gauge 10: For heavy-duty applications like brackets, bases, and massive assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   Gauge 18: For all other general purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Stainless Steel
Stainless steel, particularly the 300 series, is valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Recommended Series**: Cheapest 300 series stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Recommended Gauges**: Gauge 18 and Gauge 12 (instead of 10, as stainless is costly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Spring Temper Stainless**:
    *   **301 Full Hard (or 3/4 hard)**: Convenient for making springs by cutting a sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It can be sheared and bent despite its springiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This is preferred over 400 series spring temper stainless, which is harder to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   **17-7 PH Stainless Steel**: This alloy comes in an annealed (very soft) state and can be heat-treated in an oven to become very hard and springy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This allows for forming, bending, and spot welding while soft, then hardening the finished piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
        *   **Heat Treatment Cycle**: Typically involves heating to 760°C, cooling completely, then reheating to 580°C and cooling again (no quenching) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Always follow manufacturer instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Free-Machining Alloys
For bars and rods of both steel and stainless steel, always buy the free-machining type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   Free-machining properties are achieved by adding elements like lead or sulfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   Though slightly more expensive, it significantly reduces machining time and improves surface finish, outweighing the material cost for individual parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Aluminum
Aluminum is useful for large structures and as a heat sink material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. While copper is better for heat sinks, aluminum is a good, affordable alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Recommended Alloy**: 5052 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Its advantage is that it can be bent without cracking, unlike the more common 6061 alloy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Recommended Gauge**: Gauge 10 or 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Spring Wire
Stocking a few sizes of spring wire allows for easy creation of custom compression and tension springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Making Springs**: Wire can be gripped in a chuck with a mandrel and wound on a lathe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Ends can be bent for tension springs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, or the tension spring can be overstretched and cut to form a compression spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This process is very fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **Types**:
    *   **Music Wire**: Carbon steel, cheapest, available in all sizes, but not [[preventing_rust_in_workshop_environments | rust-proof or corrosion-resistant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
    *   **17-7 PH Stainless Steel**: For [[preventing_rust_in_workshop_environments | corrosion resistance]], available in wire form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This wire requires only one heating cycle after winding (typically 480°C for 1 hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Bearing Bronze
Bearing bronze (not brass) is the best material for components that slide on steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. A small amount of bronze plates or rods is useful for bushings or wear pads, providing long-lasting, lubricated performance against hardened steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

### Hardenable Steels
For hardening purposes, a specific type of steel is recommended due to its ease of use and minimal distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
*   **A2 Steel (Air-Hardening)**:
    *   **Advantages**: Does not require quenching, simply heat and cool in air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. It exhibits very low dimensional change after hardening, allowing for near-net-shape machining before hardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
    *   **Decarbonization Prevention**: To prevent the outer layer from losing hardness during heating, wrap the steel in paper, then in stainless foil, and seal it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. The carbonizing paper absorbs oxygen inside the foil bag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **440 Stainless Steel**: A hardenable stainless steel, often used for surgical tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. It hardens similarly to A2 (heat, then cool fast) but is not as corrosion-resistant as the 300 series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   **High-Speed Steel**: Used for cutting tools like drills and reamers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Pieces can be ground to make custom cutting tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
*   **Carbon Steel**: The cheapest hardenable steel, but requires quenching and more specialized knowledge, making it less recommended for a general shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.

#### Identifying Steels by Spark Test
Different steels can be identified by the sparks they produce when held to a grinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>:
*   **Mild Steel**: Few sparks, no "star" bursts at the end of the spark trail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.
*   **Carbon Steel**: Many sparks, with "star" bursts at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
*   **A2 Steel**: Darker, dimmer sparks, no "star" bursts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
*   **High-Speed Steel**: Even darker sparks, almost no bursts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.
*   **440 Stainless Steel**: Similar to high-speed steel, very few to no sparks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

#### Hardening Steel (A2 Example)
For small pieces, hardening can be done with a torch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.
1.  **Preparation**: Place a thermal insulator (e.g., fire brick) behind the piece to reflect heat and speed up heating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
2.  **Heating (Hardening)**: Heat the A2 steel to a white-hot temperature (around 950°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
3.  **Cooling**: Allow it to cool down in the air (move it away from the insulator if it's cooling too slowly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. Once cooled, the steel will be fully hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.
4.  **Tempering (Relieving Brittleness)**: At full hardness, the steel is brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. Tempering reduces brittleness by reheating the steel to a lower temperature, trading some hardness for toughness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
    *   **Temperature Range**: 220°C to 300°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
        *   250°C: Achieves Rockwell 60C, suitable for most applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.
        *   300°C: Achieves Rockwell 56C (lower hardness) but offers much better toughness for impact strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.
    *   **Torch Tempering**: Use a small flame and continuously move it to avoid overheating one spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. For asymmetrical parts, direct more heat to the thicker sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
    *   **Color as Indicator**: Steel changes color within this temperature range, providing a visual guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>:
        *   Straw color (approx. 220°C): Full hardness (Rockwell 60C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.
        *   Brown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
        *   Very dark blue (approx. 270°C): Rockwell 56C (more toughness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.
        *   Light blue (approx. 300°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.
        *   Overheated: Goes gray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

#### Carbide Tips
A useful technique is to braze a piece of discarded carbide insert onto a mild steel stem to create a custom cutting tool or special-sized drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. This is done by placing carbide, flux, and brazing alloy on the stem and heating the assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.

## Non-Metals (Plastics)
A minimalist selection of plastics covers various applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Polycarbonate (Lexan)
An excellent material that is completely shatterproof and can withstand fairly high temperatures (at least 100°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Acetal (Delrin)
Known for its excellent machinability among plastics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. It is relatively inexpensive and available in various shapes (plates, rods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Phenolic Laminate (G-10, Bakelite)
This material is a composite of phenolic resin and cotton fabric layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Advantages**: Does not deform easily with heat (low creep), does not break easily, machines beautifully, and holds threads very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Self-Lubricating**: Due to its cotton content, it can absorb oil and self-lubricate, making it ideal for moving parts like gears and bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Steel gears against phenolic gears offer quiet, long-lasting performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Teflon
Known for its excellent lubricity and high-temperature resistance (up to 200°C) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. It also has very good electrical properties, making it useful in RF work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. However, it is a weak material, prone to cold flow, and does not hold threads well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Primarily used for bushings that are not highly loaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### PVC and ABS
These are inexpensive plastics that can be easily glued together with solvent-based glues (commonly used by plumbers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This allows for the creation of large, strong, glued structures like boxes or tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Limitations**: Low temperature resistance (weakens above 70-80°C) and does not hold threads well without inserts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Availability**: Readily available, especially in pipe forms from hardware stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

### Polyimide (Vespel)
A very expensive but highly exotic and useful polymer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Forms**: Available as tape (useful for electrical insulation) and bulk materials like rods or plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
*   **Properties**: Highest temperature-rated polymer, usable up to 300°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Excellent electrical insulation and very good cut-through resistance (prevents sharp corners from slowly cutting through the insulation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. It holds threads well, is very rigid, and maintains its shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Variants**: Available as virgin material or filled with carbon, MoS2, or other materials to enhance bearing properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

## Other Useful Materials

### Loctite
Useful for tight fits, such as mounting bearings on shafts, and for [[creating_airtight_and_frictionless_parts | securing screws]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   **Caution**: Loctite products can cause cracking in some plastics if exposed to vapors or in close proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

### Wax Stick
A cheap and useful cutting lubricant, especially for aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.
*   **Applications**: Prevents aluminum from sticking to cutting tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. Allows aluminum to be machined with woodworking tools (e.g., cutting aluminum plates with a table saw or routing aluminum sheets with a router) by applying wax to the blade or workpiece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

Spot welding is a versatile joining process, often performed with machines that share a similar appearance, even homemade ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This technique is primarily used for welding sheet metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> and is particularly effective for connecting thin materials or rods due to high current density at small contact areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Machine Settings

The primary setting to adjust on a spot welder is the **time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Pressure Setting**: Some machines offer a pressure setting; this should generally be set to maximum and left there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Time Setting**: The time setting must be carefully adjusted based on the thickness of the metal being welded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Higher current is generally preferred with minimal time to reduce heat escape sideways, resulting in better welds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Adjusting current is typically only necessary if the lowest time setting is still too high for the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Determining the Correct Setting (Tear Test)

To find the optimal time setting:
1.  Take two test pieces of metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
2.  Make a few welds at different time settings (e.g., start with 2 cycles, then 3, then 4 cycles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
3.  Perform a **tear test**: Attempt to tear the welded pieces apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. A correct setting is achieved when the metal tears *without* the weld itself opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. If the weld opens, the setting is too weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
4.  Once familiar with the machine, you can create a chart for different materials and thicknesses (e.g., one for stainless steel and one for mild steel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Material Compatibility and Machine Limits

Spot welders operate by passing a high current (e.g., 5,000 amps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>) through the metal, generating heat due to resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Weldable Materials**: Generally, spot welders can effectively weld metals that do not conduct electricity well, such as mild steel, stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, tungsten, titanium, and other "exotic" metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Non-Weldable Materials**: Non-ferrous metals, like copper or aluminum, are generally not weldable because they conduct electricity too well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Attempting to weld them can cause electrodes to fuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Power Units**: A 15 KVA unit is typically the minimum recommended, capable of welding 3mm to 3mm thick material (Gauge 12 to Gauge 12 or Gauge 10 to Gauge 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. A 25 KVA unit can weld one gauge thicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Rods**: Spot welders are very efficient for welding rods, even half-inch rods with a 15 KVA unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This is because of the small contact area and limited heat escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Thickness Transition**: Spot welding is ideal for thinner materials. As material thickness increases, it becomes easier to weld with a TIG welder, conveniently picking up where spot welding becomes difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Applications

### Prototyping and Temporary Welds
A significant advantage of spot welding is the ability to create both temporary and permanent welds, which is very useful for [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | prototyping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Temporary Welds**: By using a lower setting (e.g., 1 cycle for a material that needs 2 cycles for permanent weld), a weak weld can be made that can be easily broken off by hand or twisted off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This allows for precise positioning of parts before making permanent connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Repairing Errors**: If a permanent weld needs to be opened, it's best to drill it out. The weld often leaves a clear center mark, making it easy to drill with a 3-4mm drill bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Attempting to pry or twist multiple permanent welds will only tear the metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Captive Hardware
Spot welding is ideal for attaching [[advanced_spot_welding_applications | captive hardware]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>:
*   **Studs**: Special weld studs have a small pip for accurate positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Standard round-head screws (Allen, slot, Phillips) can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Nuts**: Spot welding nuts have three projections and a pilot shoulder for precise alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. They require flat electrodes and a higher setting due to the larger contact area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Washers**: A plain washer can be spot welded to the back of thin sheet metal to create double thickness, allowing for tapping threads directly into the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Hinges**: Long strips of hinges can be easily spot welded to covers or boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   **Balls**: Balls are cheap and accurate, making them useful for kinematic mounts, couplings, or adjustable mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Welding balls requires custom electrodes with a conical hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Invisible Welds
To achieve an invisible weld, especially for aesthetic or cleanliness reasons (e.g., medical devices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>:
*   Standard methods using one flat electrode often result in a slight inward mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   The ideal method is to use a special electrode with a very small, shallow dimple (few mm diameter, 50 micron deep) at the weld point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. This dimple pushes metal out to compensate for the shrinkage when the molten metal cools, resulting in a perfectly flat surface that requires minimal sanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.

### Welding Difficult Materials
For materials that are difficult or impossible to weld directly, such as Nitinol (a common material in medical devices) or beryllium copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>:
*   Trap the non-weldable material between two layers of weldable material, typically stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. The weld then goes *through* the non-weldable material and fuses the stainless steel layers, effectively securing the inner material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   Bending the ends of the non-weldable material into a gradual radius before welding can prevent abrupt transitions and create a stronger joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

### Watertight Enclosures
Spot welders can create watertight enclosures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>:
*   Apply a very thin bead of RTV silicone between the parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.
*   Weld through the silicone at a dense pitch. The pressure of the weld displaces the silicone, creating a fused joint while the surrounding silicone forms a seal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.

### Salvaging Material for Water Jet Cutting
To maximize material usage with a water jet cutter (which has a clamping area that prevents cutting to the very edge) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>:
*   Spot weld a small scrap piece of material to the edge of the main piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.
*   For thin materials, simply overlap and weld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.
*   For thicker materials where a step is undesirable, butt the pieces flush and weld directly on the joint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. This horizontal melt is less strong but provides a smooth, unstepped surface for gripping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

## Electrode Creation and Customization

Many spot welding jobs require [[custom_electrode_creation_for_spot_welding | custom electrodes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
*   **Electrode Body Material**: Electrodes are primarily made from copper bars (square or round) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Copper is easy to bend and work-hardens, but can be annealed if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   **Electrode Tips**: For long-lasting tips, insert special alloys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. Copper by itself is too soft and will wear easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.
    *   **Materials**: Copper-tungsten alloy or, more commonly and cheaply, copper-chrome alloy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>.
    *   **Manufacturing**: Machine a taper on the alloy rod and press it into a corresponding taper hole in the copper electrode body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. The taper hole can be made using a simple "D-bit" tool ground from a dowel pin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.
*   **Specialty Electrodes**: Electrodes can be customized for specific access needs, such as reaching deep inside cavities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>, offset electrodes for getting around metal folds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>, or angled electrodes for precise stud alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
*   **Preventing Marking**: To prevent marking on one side of a part, use an electrode with a much larger contact area on that side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. This increased area dissipates heat, preventing it from getting hot enough to leave a mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.

## Safety Precautions

*   **Eye Protection**: Spot welding produces sparks, so always wear goggles or glasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Footwear**: Molten metal can drip, so avoid wearing sandals; closed-toe shoes are essential in a shop environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Electrical Safety**: While the voltage (around 2.5 volts) is very low and safe to touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>, be aware of the extremely high current (5,000 amps). This current generates significant magnetic forces that can attract magnetic or metallic objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.

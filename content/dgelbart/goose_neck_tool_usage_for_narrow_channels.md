The goose neck tool is a specialized piece of [[press_tooling_and_alignment_techniques | press tooling]] used on a press brake, particularly beneficial for creating narrow channels and for [[customization_and_tooling_for_precision_bending | custom bending applications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Tool Profile and Functionality
Unlike a regular bending tool, which typically has a simple V-profile at the bottom, the goose neck tool features a distinct profile that allows it to wrap around the material during the final bend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This design enables the bending of very narrow channels, even those where the depth exceeds the width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Overcoming Limitations of Standard Tools
Standard press brake tools generally limit bends to U-shapes that are wider than their depth, as the tool itself would otherwise interfere with the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The goose neck tool circumvents this limitation, allowing for "10 x 10 x 10 mm" narrow channels where the last bend can wrap around the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Application in Prototyping
For [[waterjet_cutter_for_prototyping | prototyping]] and working with small parts, the goose neck tool is highly advantageous because it facilitates the creation of these otherwise challenging narrow channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Custom Goose Neck Tools
Some specialized goose neck tools, particularly those designed for very deep channels (e.g., featuring a hole), must be custom-made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. These custom cuts are typically achieved using a [[utilizing_waterjet_cutting_for_electronic_enclosure_precision | waterjet cutter]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. To save costs, a long bar of material can be purchased and then cut into various lengths (e.g., 1-inch, 2-inch, 3-inch pieces) and special pieces as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The ability to bend deeper than wide is a key benefit of such custom tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

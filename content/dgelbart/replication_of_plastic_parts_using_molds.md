Replication of plastic parts using molds is a useful technique, especially when a part with a very good finish or specific [[characteristics_and_applications_of_various_plastics | plastic properties]] (e.g., filled plastics) is needed that cannot be achieved with [[metal_3d_printing_process | 3D printers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This process involves creating a mold, typically from [[silicone_rubber_mold_making | silicone rubber]], and then casting the desired plastic into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Creating a Silicone Rubber Mold

To create a mold, an original part (e.g., a knob) is placed in a small box and covered with [[silicone_rubber_mold_making | silicone rubber mold making]] material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This specific type of silicone rubber is unique because it does not stick to anything, eliminating the need for mold release agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The two components of the mold-making silicone rubber are mixed and poured over the part, then allowed to cure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

The flexibility of [[silicone_rubber_mold_making | silicone rubber]] allows it to capture intricate details and replicate parts with undercuts, holes, and even hex shapes (like an Allen screw head) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The process can copy details down to a molecular level, offering exceptional surface texture and detail fidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. While excellent for surface texture, the mold can distort due to its flexibility, so for dimensionally accurate molds, a metal screen can be embedded within the rubber to provide strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Removing Air Bubbles from Mold Material

When mixing viscous materials like epoxies or silicones, air bubbles can become trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. To remove these, the mixed material must be placed in a vacuum chamber and degassed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. During this process, the material will foam up significantly, requiring a container four times taller than the initial volume to prevent overflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The vacuum is maintained for about half an hour until all air bubbles have collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Casting the Copy in Vacuum

For a high-quality copy without air bubbles or defects, casting is done under vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Casting Process

1.  **Degas Resin:** First, the casting resin (e.g., polyester, epoxy, or polyurethane) itself must be degassed in a vacuum chamber, similar to the silicone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
2.  **Prepare for Casting:** Place the mold inside the vacuum chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. A guard around the mold is advisable to contain any overflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
3.  **Vacuum Fill:** Insert a feed tube with one end in the degassed resin and the other in the mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. As vacuum is applied to the chamber, it will suck the resin into the mold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
4.  **Release Vacuum:** Once the mold is full, pinch off the feed tube to stop resin flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Then, release the vacuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Releasing the vacuum causes any miniature air bubbles introduced during the filling process to collapse and disappear, ensuring a defect-free cast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
5.  **Curing:** Remove the feed tube, turn on the heater, and cure the resin according to instructions, typically between 50 to 80 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. [[silicone_rubber_mold_making | Silicone]] itself cures at around 100 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

The resin can be dyed with pigment to achieve any desired color for the replica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Mold Variations and Applications

*   **Two-Part Molds:** For parts with features on multiple sides, a two-part mold can be made by pouring a second layer of silicone over the first, incorporating registration pins for proper alignment when assembled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This enclosed mold would have a feed hole and an air escape hole for filling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Inserts and Fillers:** Metal inserts can be placed in the mold for features like threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Fillers like finely chopped carbon fiber can be mixed into the resin or laid directly inside the mold and impregnated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Impregnation:** This vacuum process is also used to impregnate electrical coils or other items that need to be waterproof and durable, as it ensures resin fills every void where air might otherwise be trapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Metal Casting:** [[silicone_rubber_mold_making | Silicone]] can withstand high temperatures for a short term, allowing it to be used for casting molten metals. Red silicone, designed for higher temperatures, can easily be used to pour zinc alloy parts and sometimes even certain aluminum alloys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. While a silicone mold can produce hundreds of plastic parts, it might only yield about ten metal parts before degrading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. A common zinc-aluminum alloy used for die casting can be cast perfectly into silicone molds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

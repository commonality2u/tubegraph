Drilling holes accurately on a [[Drill Mill and Milling Vice setup | drill press]] usually involves a multi-step process: using a center punch to mark the spot, followed by a center drill to deepen the hole, and then finally the regular drill bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. However, there are techniques that can save significant time while maintaining accuracy.

## Faster Hole Starting

Normally, if a drill is started on a surface, especially a sloped one, without a center mark, it will tend to wander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. To avoid this, a simple time-saving tip allows you to skip the center punch and center drill entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>:
*   Instead of letting the drill wander, "peck" the drill a few times quickly into the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   After a few pecks, the drill will no longer wander, allowing for a precise start and saving a lot of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Emergency Left-Hand Tapping

If you need to tap a left-hand thread but only have a right-hand tap, an emergency solution can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>:
1.  Take a standard right-hand tap and grind it flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The flat section should leave only about a third of the tap's original diameter in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  For improved tapping, two grooves can be ground into the remaining section to provide a rake angle for the cutting edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This is done after flattening the tap, using a hand grinder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
3.  First, [[Drilling Holes Accurately | drill a hole]] in your workpiece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
4.  Place the modified tap into the drill press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
5.  Apply cutting fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
6.  **Crucially**, run the drill press *backwards* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. By reversing the drill's rotation, the modified right-hand tap will cut a perfect left-hand thread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Drilling Accurate Cross Holes in a Lathe

Drilling accurate cross holes on the center line of a cylinder can be challenging without specialized jigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. While the classic "Regloo" jig is very effective, it is also very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. A simple and inexpensive alternative involves replacing the tailstock center with a V-block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>:
*   Use a hardened steel V-block where the V is precisely aligned with the center line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   For better accuracy, position the V-block horizontally rather than vertically. If placed vertically, any tailstock misalignment could lead to off-center drilling, whereas horizontal placement is less susceptible to this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   When the cylindrical workpiece is placed in the V-block, it will be held exactly on the center line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   This setup allows for accurate drilling of cross holes using a center drill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

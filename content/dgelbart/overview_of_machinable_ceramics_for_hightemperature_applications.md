Working with materials other than metals, such as plastics and ceramics, is often necessary in R&D work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Ceramics are specifically chosen when high-temperature resistance, excellent electrical insulation, or transparency are required, for example, in applications like heaters or crucibles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Machinable Ceramics

A significant advantage of certain ceramic materials is their machinability, often comparable to that of aluminum, while retaining high-temperature resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Most machinable ceramics can be tapped and threaded without needing inserts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. All mentioned machinable ceramics can be perfectly cut using a water jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Micx (Glass-Mica Composite)

Micx is a glass-mica composite that can withstand temperatures up to approximately 1,000°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Its [[Basics of Machining Techniques | machinability]] is similar to aluminum, allowing for filing and drilling at comparable speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. It maintains a very good finish and is a highly stable material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Micx exhibits omnidirectional properties, meaning its characteristics are consistent regardless of the direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Unfortunately, it is becoming rarer and more expensive as it is being phased out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Machinable Alumina

Machinable alumina is readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. While machinable in its unfired state, it can be subsequently fired to become extremely hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Boron Nitride (Hexagonal Form)

Sometimes referred to as "white graphite," hexagonal boron nitride possesses exceptional lubricity, feeling self-lubricating, making it ideal for bearings and sliding surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. It can withstand very high temperatures, at least 1,500°C, and potentially higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. It also has a low thermal expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Boron nitride is very easily machinable, not overly expensive, and completely inert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Its primary limitation is its lack of strength and hardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Slate

Considered a "poor man's ceramic," slate is versatile and very inexpensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. It is machinable, with speeds comparable to boron nitride or micx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Slate can be sanded beautifully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. The main disadvantage is its tendency to delaminate when heated near 1,000°C, due to its layered structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This can be mitigated by designing parts such that strength is not required in the delaminating dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### Zirconia

Zirconia is an exotic ceramic material renowned for having one of the highest hardnesses, strengths, and melting points among all ceramics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. It is also an excellent thermal insulator, surpassing alumina in strength, hardness, and insulating properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

Though expensive (5-10 times more than other options) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, zirconia can be acquired in "green fired" (semi-fired) blocks, often used for dental crowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. These soft blocks can be machined on a regular milling machine or with a file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. After machining, the parts are sent to a dental lab for firing, which transforms them into an extremely hard material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

A critical consideration for zirconia is the significant linear shrinkage (20-30%) that occurs during firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This shrinkage is predictable and omnidirectional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, allowing for parts to be scaled up by the shrinkage factor before machining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Due to slight uncertainties, leaving 0.1-0.2 mm of material for post-firing [[high_precision_machining_techniques | diamond machining]] is recommended for final [[high_accuracy_in_machining | accuracy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Once fired, zirconia can only be machined with diamond tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Its properties are similar to tungsten carbide, capable of cutting steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

## Hardened Alumina

Unlike machinable ceramics, pre-hardened alumina parts (pipes, plates, rods) cannot be filed and will damage a file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. It is very hard, strong, and brittle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. If the required size is available, it can be cut or ground using diamond tooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

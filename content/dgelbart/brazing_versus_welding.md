When constructing three-dimensional, rigid, and machinable structures, alternatives to milling from a solid block or using castings are necessary, especially in an R&D environment where [[comparison_of_brazed_assemblies_and_cast_iron | castings]] are tedious to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Two common industrial methods for building up segments are welding and brazing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Comparison of Brazing and Welding

### Welding
Welding is widely used in industry for building up structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

**Disadvantages of Welding:**
*   **Skill Requirement:** Welding generally requires more skill than brazing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Distortion:** Heavy distortion occurs due to the shrinkage of the weld bead, regardless of how carefully the welding is performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Material Compatibility:** Welding struggles with very [[material_compatibility_with_spot_welding | dissimilar metals]]. For example, two types of steel can be welded together, but steel and brass cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Brazing
Brazing is an alternative process for building up segments from different materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

**Advantages of Brazing:**
*   **Skill Requirement:** Brazing requires less skill compared to welding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Material Versatility:** A key advantage is the ability to join very [[material_compatibility_with_spot_welding | dissimilar metals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This allows for assemblies where each segment can be made from the optimal material (e.g., steel for one side and brass for bearings or machining on another) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This capability is not possible with traditional casting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Strength:** [[benefits_of_brazing_in_prototype_building | Brazed assemblies]] are generally stronger than [[comparison_of_brazed_assemblies_and_cast_iron | cast iron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Cast iron, especially older high-quality versions, is not a strong material and can be easily broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Aesthetics:** Once brazed, surfaces can be finished to look like a perfect casting, often appearing nicer because they have smoother surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Brazing Process for Near Net Shape Assemblies
The process of building up assemblies by brazing to resemble [[comparison_of_brazed_assemblies_and_cast_iron | castings]] typically involves creating near net shape parts, which are then machined at critical points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Preparation
1.  **Part Cutting:** All individual parts are typically cut out using a water jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
2.  **Part Registration/Tacking:**
    *   To register and secure parts, a tab can be cut, or a small finger/square hole can be used for alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, parts can be temporarily [[prototyping_and_temporary_welding_techniques | tacked in place]] using a [[laser_welding_advantages | laser welder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. A [[spot_welding_basics_and_setup | spot welder]] can also be used for tacking, but not for brazing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Dowel pins are another option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
    *   [[laser_welding_advantages | Laser welders]] are versatile for tacking as they can weld in hard-to-reach places, weld [[material_compatibility_with_spot_welding | dissimilar metals]] (e.g., aluminum to steel, silver to lead) due to fast pulse, and weld without inert atmosphere because the weld is so fast that oxidation doesn't occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
3.  **Brazing Material and Flux Application:**
    *   Brazing is done using small pieces of brazing wire, typically a silver-copper alloy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
    *   Flux is crucial as it dissolves oxides and protects the metal from oxidation, allowing the brazing material to wet the metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
    *   Common fluxes include:
        *   White flux (borax-based), used for non-ferrous metals and iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
        *   Black flux (fluoride salt), more aggressive, used for stainless steel and harder-to-braze materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
    *   The brazing wire is placed around the joint, typically half-buried in the flux, which is applied as a paste to create a fillet where the braze should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
    *   Excess flux should be wiped away as it can chemically attack the metal at high temperatures, causing cosmetic surface defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
    *   For vertical joints, it is ideal to lay out everything horizontally. If not possible, more material can be placed on top to be pulled down, or a hole can be drilled to insert slugs of brazing wire and flux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
    *   Brazing in multiple steps is problematic because the first braze can oxidize. It's better to find a way to complete the braze in one step, ensuring all gaps are filled with flux to prevent oxidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
    *   Ideal gaps for brazing range from zero to about half a millimeter; larger gaps weaken capillary action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Brazing foils can be used for large areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

### Heating and Cooling
1.  **Oven Heating:** The assembly is placed in an oven, typically set to about 750°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The temperature should be 50-100°C above the melting point of the braze alloy to ensure it melts and flows well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
2.  **Soaking Time:** After reaching temperature, a soaking time is necessary for the material to absorb heat and equalize. A general rule of thumb is one hour for every kilo of material, plus an initial period for reaching temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
3.  **Cooling:** After the soaking period, the oven is turned off, and the assembly is left untouched until it cools down to approximately 500°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

### Post-Brazing Finishing
After cooling, the part is typically sandblasted to remove residual flux and reveal the brazed joints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The brazing process creates a nice fillet due to good wetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. To achieve a perfectly smooth appearance for painting, the fillets can be lightly sanded to round them up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

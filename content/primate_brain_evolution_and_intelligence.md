In the recent discussion with Carl Shulman, several fascinating insights into [[neuroscience_insights_on_intelligence_and_ai | primate brain evolution and its implications for understanding intelligence]] were explored. This discussion provides a window into how natural selection for cognitive abilities occurred and how this knowledge can be applied to the development of artificial intelligence.

## The Scale-up of Primate Brains

One of the core ideas presented was the incremental evolution of primate brains, specifically focusing on the human brain as a scaled-up version of primate brains. [[evolution_of_intelligence_and_learning | Herculano-Houzel's work]] on dissolving brains to count neurons and study scaling laws reveals important trends, illustrating how the structure and size of the brain regions change across different mammals as they scale up [00:40:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">40:52</a>).

### Resource Allocation and Cognitive Payoff

A significant part of the discussion centered on how humans expended more resources on brain growth and development to gain cognitive benefits. Shulman stated humans allocated such resources towards bigger brains and longer childhoods. [[ai_scaling_and_its_effectiveness | This investment echoes the incentives for training larger AI models today]], analogous to investing more compute in a larger model for better AI performance [00:41:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">41:45</a>).

## Trade-offs in Evolution

Shulman described that the evolutionary constraints witnessed in animals do not apply to AI development, suggesting that AI might surpass human intelligence by avoiding the evolutionary trade-offs that biological organisms faced. Many animals did not evolve human-level intelligence because they lived in environments where a larger brain wasnâ€™t worth the energy costs. [[human_evolutionary_biology_and_anthropology | In contrast, humans ended up in an ecological niche]] where technological advancements and language increased returns to larger brains and longer developmental periods [00:44:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">44:01</a>).

### Energy Concerns and Evolutionary Pressures

A further point was made about human metabolic energy distribution. Humans direct about 20% of their metabolic energy towards maintaining brain activity, which showcases a significant investment in cognitive functions. Nevertheless, despite pressures such as high energy demands and risks of disease, this investment was maintained because cognitive enhancements provided greater evolutionary benefits over time [00:54:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">54:56</a>).

## Implications for AI Research

Shulman pointed out that the constraints which limited evolution's capacity to develop intelligence further are not necessarily applicable for developing AI. Where evolution might have favored energy efficiency and risk minimization, [[future_capabilities_and_progress_of_ai_models | AI development can prioritize raw computation and information processing]], surpassing what evolution achieved in neural architectures [01:01:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">01:01:10</a>).

## Conclusion

The conversation with Carl Shulman draws interesting parallels between biological evolution and the development of AI. Understanding the evolution of primate brains not only helps explain human intelligence's unique development path but also highlights opportunities and strategies for creating advanced artificial intelligence. [[challenges_and_considerations_for_achieving_agi | By bypassing the ecological constraints]] that limited biological organisms, AI has the potential to explore new levels of cognitive capabilities, echoing the path of evolutionary scaling yet without its limitations.

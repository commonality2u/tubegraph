Dominic Cummings, former chief advisor to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and a key figure in the Brexit campaign [[impact_of_brexit_on_uk_politics | impact of Brexit on UK politics]], offered insights into the workings and dysfunctions of the UK government and its bureaucracy. This article summarizes his observations based on his experiences.

## The Reality of No. 10 Downing Street

### Physical Environment and Daily Chaos
No. 10 Downing Street is described not as a modern office building, but as a "rabbit warren of old townhouses that have been knocked together behind the scenes". This creates a "very, very odd physical environment". Cummings emphasizes the "constant string of chaos" that defines daily life within the building. He illustrates this with an example of a single day during the COVID crisis, which could involve discussions on lockdowns, the Prime Minister's girlfriend's media concerns, calls from then-US President Trump about military action in Iraq, conflicting advice from the "deep state," and other concurrent disasters like flooding. This relentless influx of news and crises makes it intrinsically difficult for the small number of people involved to address extremely hard problems [[vaccinateca_initiative_and_vaccine_distribution_issues_during_covid19 | VaccinateCA initiative and vaccine distribution issues during COVID-19]].

### Technological Deficiencies
Upon arriving in No. 10 in summer 2019, Cummings noted a severe lack of basic modern office technology, such as a functional file-sharing system like Google Docs or Microsoft Teams. This absence was attributed to a combination of bureaucracy, security concerns, and inter-departmental arguments [[institutional_failures_in_us_public_health_and_logistics | institutional failures in U.S. public health and logistics]]. The debate over whether Teams or Google Docs was more susceptible to interception by China or Russia ensued for months without resolution, even impacting COVID response efforts. Eventually, GCHQ was tasked to build a system. However, years later, the Cabinet Office and No. 10 were reportedly still debating the issue and planning to hire consultants for millions of pounds to study it [[big_techs_role_and_limitations_in_public_sector_crises | Big Tech's role and limitations in public sector crises]].

## Core Problems in UK Government Management

### Prioritization and the Prime Minister's Time
A fundamental problem is the management of the Prime Minister's (PM) time and prioritization. The PM's time is the "most important asset" because their decisions are often the only way to break bureaucratic resistance and ensure action, especially since normal parts of the system "can't really do anything quickly at all, even in a crisis". However, this asset is "constantly pulled hither and thither by all of this craziness".

Cummings described an attempt to reorient No. 10 away from being a "press entertainment service" focused on media responses, towards a system that prioritizes important long-term issues. However, daily crises, like a terrorist incident, inevitably demand the PM's attention. The issue is that this crisis-response model has become the norm for how PMs spend almost all their time, with no background system or dedicated team focused on truly important long-term agendas like science, technology, productivity, or procurement reform [[leadership_and_strategic_reform_within_government | leadership and strategic reform within government]].

### Media Obsession vs. Substantive Work
A major point of contention between Cummings and Boris Johnson, emerging as early as January 2020, was the focus on media relations [[media_influence_on_politics | Media influence on politics]]. Following the 2019 election victory, Johnson wanted to "make friends with all of these people [journalists]". Cummings argued against this, advocating for a focus on systemic change and addressing "big problems facing the country". Johnson's preference was to avoid alienating the media, leading Cummings to warn that this approach would result in "chasing the bullshit in the media all day" and achieving little of substance.

Cummings observes that most politicians prefer spending time "running around all day dealing with the media" rather than on important problems. This is partly because they've grown up in a system where they "don't know any better" and because promotions are often perceived to depend on being a "good media performer". This incentivizes leaking and prioritizes media appearances over departmental goals. In early 2020, an attempt was made to reduce media engagement by stopping ministerial appearances on a prominent BBC Radio show, which resulted in the media and many MPs going "completely crazy".

### Ministerial Power (or Lack Thereof)
Ministers, despite being described as "running the department," have very limited direct power. For example, a Secretary of State for Defence can typically only fire the three personal staff they bring in, not the hundreds of thousands of others in the department. Personnel decisions largely rest with the "Permanent secretary".

Only the Prime Minister has the legal and constitutional ability to order the removal of a failing senior official from their post, though this too has complications. This concentrates significant power but also creates tremendous bottlenecks in No. 10.

### Bureaucratic Bottlenecks and Sloth
The "incredibly old, centralized bureaucracies" struggle to cope with crises. Cummings notes that the British constitutional system operates on the principle that "Responsibility and authority are not delegated together," unlike effective management principles highlighted by General Groves of the Manhattan Project [[the_making_and_impact_of_the_atomic_bomb | the making and impact of the atomic bomb]]. This means "nobody really is in charge of anything. Lots of people can criticize... Almost nobody ever has the authority just to build something or just to do something".

#### The Role of the PM in Overcoming Bureaucracy
During crises, when no part of the system can move fast, bottlenecks escalate dramatically to the PM's office. This is because "ultimately only the president or only the Prime Minister can give certain kinds of orders".

*   **Example: PPE Procurement during COVID:** At the peak of the COVID crisis, when essential PPE was not expected until summer due to standard shipping from China, Cummings instructed to "call up the airlines, tell them that we're taking their planes, we're flying all the planes to China, we're picking up all our shit, we're bringing it back here. Do that now". Only the PM could authorize this by personally accepting legal responsibility and overriding EU rules, treasury guidance, etc. [[vaccineca_initiative_and_vaccine_distribution_issues_during_covid19 | VaccinateCA initiative and vaccine distribution issues during COVID-19]].

*   **Example: Vaccine Task Force:** To deal with vaccines, a completely different entity was created outside the normal system. The PM instructed the appointee to "Ignore all the EU procurement rules. Ignore all UK procurement rules. Ignore everything... We're freeing you from all the normal Whitehall, HR, all the normal things which add massive friction". Despite this, the task force was still plagued by resistance from Whitehall. Success depended on the empowered individual's willingness to push, their access to the PM, and the PM's willingness to support them and remove obstructive officials [[leadership_and_strategic_reform_within_government | leadership and strategic reform within government]].

*   **Example: Rapid Testing:** To get rapid testing operational, a former SAS commanding officer was brought in. Despite an initial meeting where top officials agreed to wartime footing and exemption from normal civil service HR and procurement bullshit, a week later, no progress was made. Cummings had to reconvene the meeting and threaten firings via the PM to get the system to comply.

Even in a crisis with thousands dying, large parts of the bureaucracy will "still simply say 'No. We are optimizing for sticking to the old rules'".

## The Civil Service and Bureaucratic Culture

### Historical Origins and Evolution
The modern British civil service system originated in the 1850s as a move away from an aristocratic patronage system towards a meritocratic one [[cultural_evolution_and_its_role_in_human_history | cultural evolution and its role in human history]]. While the old system had corruption, it also moved faster and more efficiently in crises. Over time, the supposedly meritocratic system has become a "closed caste," promoting almost entirely internally and thus closed to most external talent [[human_genetic_and_cultural_adaptations | human genetic and cultural adaptations]]. This is defended on constitutional grounds but is self-serving and leads to paralysis.

### Talent and Promotion
Cummings clarifies that his critique is not that everyone in the civil service is "rubbish". Many able people, especially younger ones, exist within it. However, the system weeds out the "young, excellent people" through self-selection. These individuals, often idealistic, observe the promotion process and their bosses, and the best ones decide they don't want to conform to a culture of "bullshit" where they can't build anything. Consequently, "the most entrepreneurial... leave and the most HR compliant, disastrous people... are the ones who are promoted". This self-reinforcing culture makes change very difficult [[leadership_and_strategic_reform_within_government | leadership and strategic reform within government]].

### Resistance to Change and Innovation
Many within the system don't perceive it as dysfunctional; it's simply "normal" for them. Cummings gives an example of data projects taking two and a half years, where the actual work took 8-12 weeks, the rest being "the system emailing each other about legal permissions". For those who've been in the system for decades, this is "completely standard". Attempts to do things differently, as in 2020, were "extremely disruptive and extremely unwelcome".

#### Post-COVID Reversion
Instead of learning from successes like the Vaccine Task Force or sewage monitoring, these initiatives were largely closed down or reverted to standard bureaucratic control after Cummings and his team left [[historical_influence_of_economists_hayek_keynes_smith | historical influence of economists: Hayek, Keynes, Smith]]. Those "most wrong" during COVID were often given awards and promotions, while those "most obviously repeatedly right have almost all left". When a new entity like the Vaccine Task Force is created outside normal rules, once the strong counterforce (like direct PM backing) is removed, different parts of the system (e.g., Cabinet Office HR, Treasury spending rules) will automatically seek to bring it back under normal, restrictive controls. "The system will just devour the new entity very, very quickly" unless the PM actively prevents it.

### Incentives and Disincentives for Speaking Out
There is little incentive for officials to speak out about dysfunction. Even after a major crisis like COVID, the system tends to revert to normal, with MPs ignoring lessons learned. In 2021, legal actions were brought arguing that the problem in 2020 was "that we went too fast," targeting the Vaccine Task Force and rapid testing. The system investigated these claims rather than defending rapid action, sending a clear signal: "You will be promoted for being the most insane process, and you will be demoted and blacklisted if you say this process is insane and try to do better".

## The Role of the Prime Minister

### Authority and Limitations
The PM in the British system, in some ways, has more power and is less legally constrained than the US President due to ancient assumptions of operating with the authority of the Crown and royal prerogative, especially in crises [[prime_ministers_authority_and_decisionmaking | Prime Minister's authority and decision-making]]. However, Cummings argues it's "impossible to be a good PM if you accept the way that the job currently works", as one is "just buffeted by media events all day, and you don't actually control the government". Historically, effective leaders did not operate under such constraints.

### The PM's Office vs. Departments
An "oddity" in the system is the PM's private office, which traditionally includes a dozen or so "young, bright people". These individuals, while not formally senior in the hierarchy, wield significant unofficial power due to their daily proximity to the PM. Cummings cited Jono Evans (Brexit negotiations) and Hannah (deep state coordination) as examples of such capable individuals. He joked that swapping these private secretaries for the Cabinet ministers would improve caliber tenfold.

### Impact of PM's Personal Priorities (e.g., Boris Johnson)
Boris Johnson was prepared to be "aggressive and revolutionary" in 2019 to survive as PM, not necessarily for the country's benefit. Post-election, his priority shifted to wanting a "nice time" and being "friends with insiders," rather than undertaking the hard work of systemic reform. The perceived weakness of the opposition (Keir Starmer) also reduced Johnson's impetus for radical change.

After the first wave of COVID, Johnson was initially "highly aggressive" about systemic change, leading to the removal of about half a dozen permanent secretaries in summer 2020. This was met with accusations of a "rolling coup" by insiders. However, Johnson later retreated from major reforms, fearing it would "annoy so many people".

## Specific Departmental Issues

### The Treasury
Cummings describes the Treasury as often "anti-growth in most important ways". He promoted Rishi Sunak to Chancellor because Sunak was brighter than typical MPs, hardworking, detail-oriented, had private sector experience, and seemed interested in useful work rather than media appearances [[historical_influence_of_economists_hayek_keynes_smith | historical influence of economists: Hayek, Keynes, Smith]].

A key reform attempt was to create "one team between Number 10 and Number 11 (the Treasury)" with transparent data sharing. Traditionally, the Treasury hides significant financial information from No. 10, which Cummings calls "completely insane". This unprecedented transparency was reversed within hours of Cummings leaving No. 10.

As PM, Sunak is seen as "trying to make the old system work" and treating it with respect, resulting in "political disintegration" where he lacks control and a clear message.

### Ministry of Defence (MoD)
MoD procurement is characterized as "catastrophic". There's resistance from senior figures to adopting new, cheaper technologies like drones, often to protect existing budgets and programs [[leadership_and_strategic_reform_within_government | leadership and strategic reform within government]]. The Watchkeeper drone program, admitted internally to be a disaster in 2020, was not closed down but received more funding, continuing to fail.

Debates in 2019-20 about future fighter jets being manned by 2040-2045, with classified studies allegedly showing drones couldn't do the job, were dismissed by Cummings as "total bullshit" after suggesting review by AI experts [[the_impact_of_modern_technology_on_warfare_and_strategy | the impact of modern technology on warfare and strategy]]. Despite this, the UK continues with plans for an optionally manned fighter with BAE Systems.

British aircraft carriers are described as a "joke" and a "massive waste of money"; in war games against peer opponents, they "immediately flee... so that they don't get sunk".

## National Security Implications of Dysfunction

### General Secrecy and Lack of Oversight
While intelligence services and special forces have "incredibly able and incredibly public spirited people", the bureaucracy in this world also exhibits some of the "very worst, most appalling aspects," partly because classification can hide "extraordinary public disasters". The prioritization process for intelligence capabilities is "extraordinarily awful". Much of this has shifted away from political oversight, with Cummings noting he was often the only political figure discussing these matters with officials in a long time [[cold_war_and_international_alliances | Cold War and international alliances]]. This lack of oversight allows bureaucracy to metastasize.

### Cybersecurity (China's Infiltration)
China's infiltration of critical UK infrastructure and data systems is "much, much worse than practically all MPs have any comprehension of". Cummings recounts meetings where senior figures, including the now-PM, were "literally with their mouths wide agog" at the revelations. He describes a nightmare scenario where critical data systems are controlled by Chinese intelligence, stating "That is the reality" [[cybersecurity_and_ai_vulnerabilities | cybersecurity and AI vulnerabilities]].

### Nuclear Enterprise
The state of the UK's nuclear weapons infrastructure, safety, and procurement is "absolutely horrific". This is due to years of administrations punting hard problems, catastrophic procurement, and classification hiding issues. Tens of billions of pounds needed for the nuclear infrastructure do not appear in official accounts, and parts of the infrastructure "just don't work properly" with "appalling safety" [[cold_war_nuclear_weapon_developments_and_global_politics | Cold War nuclear weapon developments and global politics]].

### Biosecurity
In a summer 2020 meeting on biosecurity, system insiders reassured Cummings that various advanced biotech capabilities were "impossible" or "ten years away". However, a young scientist Cummings brought to the meeting, who had worked at Janelia Farm, revealed that "pretty much everything that everyone has said is impossible or will take ten years, I have personally done in the lab in the last two or three years" [[ai_for_science_and_societal_challenges | AI for Science and Societal Challenges]]. This highlights a disconnect between official assessments and cutting-edge reality.

## Challenges to Reform

### Systemic Resistance
The entire system, from civil servants to MPs, is deeply entrenched in existing ways of working. Attempts at radical change are met with fierce resistance, often framed as undermining democracy or constitutional norms [[historical_analysis_of_world_war_i_and_world_war_ii | historical analysis of World War I and World War II]].

### Lack of Political Will
Even with a large majority and a crisis like COVID, fundamental reform was stymied by the PM's eventual reluctance to confront widespread opposition and pursue difficult changes. Most politicians prioritize "social relations within the insider network" over substantive achievement.

### The "Kayfabe" of Politics
There is a "Potemkin charade" where MPs are filmed going into Cabinet meetings that are largely scripted, creating an illusion of them being in charge. The media perpetuates this, as reporting on the actual power wielded by relatively unknown officials (like PM's private secretaries) would "antagonize everyone" [[challenges_of_political_leadership_and_governance | Challenges of Political Leadership and Governance]].

### The Catch-22 of Attracting Talent
The more dysfunctional politics becomes, the less likely competent people are to get involved, preferring to insulate themselves in successful private ventures ("fish ponds"). Those who do step in, like Elon Musk, face intense vilification if they challenge prevailing narratives [[challenges_and_advancements_in_ai_training_techniques | Challenges and advancements in AI training techniques]].

## Proposed Solutions/Paths Forward (Cummings' Perspective)

### Need for Elite Shift
Fundamental change requires a subset of elites, currently outside politics, to decide their goal is solving problems, not maneuvering within the existing social hierarchy of insiders. This group needs common goals and the ability to build a wider network [[leadership_and_strategic_reform_within_government | leadership and strategic reform within government]].

### Focus on Voters (for elections)
Winning elections is the "easy part" if a political entity genuinely focuses on voters, as existing parties are often disconnected from public concerns [[challenges_of_political_leadership_and_governance | Challenges of Political Leadership and Governance]]. Obsessing on the "customer" (the voter) like Jeff Bezos did at Amazon is key [[stripe_growth_strategy_and_impact_on_global_markets | Stripe's growth, strategy, and impact on global markets]].

### Parallel Structures and Sunset Clauses
To reform entities like the MoD, one shouldn't try to reform existing procurement from within. Instead, "set up a parallel thing... and then you have to close the existing procurement system and get rid of 95% to 99% of the people involved". Long-term change requires building in mechanisms for "constant reinvention and rejuvenation and closing and refounding of things" [[ai_alignment_and_safety_research | AI alignment and safety research]].

### Odyssean Education for Leaders
Politics requires leaders with diverse knowledge, understanding Thucydides and statistical modeling, literature, and science, capable of synthesis. Current elite education (e.g., PPE at Oxford) encourages "wordcel bluffing" over substance and implementation. New educational approaches could combine broad intellectual study with practical experience in diverse fields like startups, military, or healthcare. Bringing established external talent into government for specific problems is also vital [[effective_learning_strategies_and_tools | Effective learning strategies and tools]]. Policy and management/implementation roles should be integrated from the start of policy development.

Cummings concludes with "pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will": expect historical patterns of failure, but still try to effect positive change.

For those who are visual learners, [[creating_a_mind_map_for_ad_inspiration | mind maps]] can be a game-changer in [[creative_strategy_and_datadriven_systems | creative strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. They provide a way to visualize the many dimensions available for testing variations in messaging angles, offer scripts, [[visual_hooks_and_modular_creative_strategy | hooks]], static formats, video formats, duration, visual treatments, and audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

This approach helps to visualize what elements are performing well for brands or clients, what is not working as effectively, and what can be iterated upon for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The core idea is to combine these successful elements or "dimensions" to create winning video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Since this system is [[databacked_creative_decisionmaking | data-backed]], combining previously successful elements increases the creative win rate over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Creative Dimensions Categorization

The [[mind_map_for_cataloging_ad_elements | mind map]] organizes creative dimensions based on their performance, moving from most proven to ideas for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>:

*   **Scalers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>: Elements that reliably scale a creative concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **What Works** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>: Elements that are currently performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Middle of the Road** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>: Variations where some are winning and beating cost-per-acquisition (CPA) goals, but others are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. These are areas for potential iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Don't Work** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>: Static or video formats that consistently fail despite testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. It's important to label and track these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Currently Testing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>: Elements that are presently being evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Ideas** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>: A repository for new hooks, audio, visual treatments, scripts, and format concepts to test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Examples of Creative Elements

Within the "Ideas" bucket, various types of creative elements can be explored:

*   **Static Formats**: Examples include "us versus them," "before/after," Post-it notes, simple tweet style, Apple notes style, WhatsApp conversations, and iMessage conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Video Formats**: Can include "before/after," "us versus them," founder story, and user-generated content (UGC), including [[ai_tools_for_creative_production_and_testing | AI-generated UGC]], which is currently being tested and shows promising results on par with regular UGC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Scripts**: Frameworks like listicles, problem-agitate-solution, before/after bridge, and feature-advantage-benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Visual Treatments**: Such as a split-frame concept (e.g., video game on bottom, podcast clip on top) or adding kaleidoscope effects to a visual hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Hooks**: Can be further categorized into text hooks (e.g., "This could be you in three months"), visual hooks, and audio hooks (e.g., trending music or viral audio clips) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Combining Elements for Higher Win Rates

As more creative elements are tested, the mind map provides a clearer understanding of what works, what doesn't, and what scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This enables the strategic combination of known high-performing elements for a higher win rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. For example, combining a successful hook like "bust through a 20-year plateau" with a blue Post-it note, or a "how to get better at Guitar" script with an artist performance, based on past account performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

This [[scientific_process_in_creative_strategy | scientific process]] provides conviction and helps visualize the next steps for testing, fostering [[alloying_concept_in_creative_strategy | creative diversity]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

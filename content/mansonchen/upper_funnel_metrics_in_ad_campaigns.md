When [[evaluating_ad_performance | evaluating ad performance]], particularly for creative testing, upper funnel metrics provide insights into how effectively an ad captures initial attention and engagement before a conversion occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. These metrics are crucial for understanding initial user interaction with video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Key Upper Funnel Metrics

Several [[custom_metrics_in_facebook_ads | custom metrics]] are considered important for upper funnel analysis:
*   **Link Click-Through Rate (LCTR)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>
*   **Hook Rate** – Calculated as 3-second video views divided by impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This metric indicates how many people watch at least the first three seconds of a video ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Hold Rate** – Calculated as through-plays (15-second views) divided by impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This shows how many people watch at least 15 seconds of a video ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Importance of Elements Affecting Upper Funnel Metrics

The initial elements of an ad significantly impact upper funnel performance:
*   **Hooks** – These are among the most important elements to test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
    *   Text Headline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
    *   Visual Hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>
    *   Audio Hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>
*   **Beginning of the Body** – The first frame of the body video is important, as is the problem statement after the hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Call-to-Actions (CTAs)** – These are considered less important to test compared to hooks and the beginning of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. On average, users only watch 5-6 seconds of a video ad, meaning testing the hook and beginning of the body covers 60-75% of the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Using Upper Funnel Metrics in Creative Testing

Upper funnel metrics are critical for [[testing_video_ad_effectiveness_with_metrics | testing video ad effectiveness with metrics]] and identifying which specific ad components are working or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. When [[understanding_facebook_ads_reporting_for_creative_testing | understanding Facebook Ads Reporting for Creative Testing]], different scenarios can inform testing strategies:

*   **High Hook Rate, Bad CPA** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>:
    *   If the hook rate is above a benchmark (e.g., 30%) but the Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) is not meeting goals, it suggests the hook is effective, but the rest of the ad is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   In this case, test different body videos with the same hook, focusing on scripts, visuals, or music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

*   **Low Hook Rate, Bad CPA** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>:
    *   If the hook rate is below a benchmark (e.g., less than 30%) and CPA is bad, the hook itself is the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
    *   Focus on testing different hooks, headlines, creators, visuals, or music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

*   **High Hold Rate, Bad CPA** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>:
    *   If the hold rate is high (e.g., 10%) indicating people watch past 15 seconds, but CPA is bad, this suggests engagement but not conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   Consider testing different hooks, creators, visuals, music, or scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## Avoiding Campaign Damage with Upper Funnel Performance

It is recommended to have a [[optimizing_and_scaling_facebook_ad_campaigns | dedicated creative testing campaign]] separate from an [[optimizing_and_scaling_facebook_ad_campaigns | Evergreen campaign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This is because ads with very good upper funnel metrics (high hook rate, high install rate) but poor lower funnel performance (low trial starts or subscriptions) can lead Meta (Facebook) to spend a lot on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. These ads capture attention and clicks due to strong visuals or hooks, but don't convert to desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This can "wreck" an Evergreen campaign by spending significant budget on non-converting ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

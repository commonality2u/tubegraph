When generating [[AIgenerated visual hooks | visual hooks]] for creatives using the Deforum Stable Diffusion notebook, custom model checkpoints can be utilized to augment creative strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Model Selection

The process involves using a custom model checkpoint within the Stable Diffusion notebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   The `deliberate` model is currently in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   For initial runs, it is recommended to select the `V 1.5 pruned EMA only` checkpoint, which is linked in the resource page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Setup and Directory Structure

Setting up the model for the first time can be tricky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
1.  **Download the Model:** Obtain the `V 1.5 pruned EMA only` checkpoint model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
2.  **Create Directory Path:** Establish the following folder structure within your Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>:
    *   `content/drive/my drive/AI/models/` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
3.  **Move the File:** Place the downloaded `V 1.5 pruned EMA only` checkpoint file into the `models` folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Many marketing teams understand the importance of [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] but may not know the exact methodology for effective implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While there isn't a single universal approach, a structured [[principles_of_creative_testing_campaigns | creative testing structure]] can be tailored to various needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. One key element of this structure is creating a dedicated creative testing campaign.

## Setting Up Your Dedicated Creative Testing Campaign

When running ads on [[creative_testing_in_facebook_ads | Meta]] (Facebook), it's crucial to establish a separate campaign specifically for testing creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Within this campaign, you'll set up individual test ad sets (e.g., Test Ad Set 1, 2, 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Optimization Event
The optimization event for your [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] campaign should align with your Evergreen campaign's objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For example, if your Evergreen campaign optimizes for purchases, your [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] campaign should do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For app install campaigns, optimizing for trial starts is generally recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Budgeting
Ideally, the daily budget at the ad set level should aim for at least 50 conversions per week at your average Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. For instance, if your average CPA is $10, an ad set daily budget of approximately $70 would be appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Although [[effective_creative_testing_strategies_on_facebook | Facebook]] recently adjusted its learning phase to require only about 10 conversions per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, aiming for 50 conversions per week per ad set test generally leads to more stable performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Structuring Ad Set Tests

Within each ad set test, the goal is to isolate and test one specific variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This allows marketers to pinpoint what is (or isn't) working effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Key Elements to Test
Common variables to test include:
*   **Hook:** This can involve testing different text headlines, visual portions, or audio hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, as the hook and beginning of the body make up 60-75% of your video ad's initial viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Body:** The body encompasses the script (e.g., problem-agitate-solution, listicles, educational scripts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, music/voiceover, and visual concepts (e.g., 3D motion graphics, UGC ads, talking head ads, Founder story ads, skit ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Call to Action (CTA):** While testable, CTAs are generally less critical than the hook or the start of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, as most users only watch 5-6 seconds of an ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Performance Metrics
Ads are primarily judged on their CPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Aim for at least 30 conversions on an ad before deciding to duplicate it into your Evergreen campaign or pause it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This ensures confidence in the ad's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

Upper-funnel metrics to consider during [[testing_and_iterating_ad_concepts | iteration]] include:
*   **Link Clickthrough Rate (LCTR)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>
*   **Hook Rate:** 3-second video view divided by impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>
*   **Hold Rate:** Throughplay (15-second view) divided by impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>

These metrics help guide [[testing_and_iterating_ad_concepts | iteration]] strategies. For example:
*   If hook rate is good (e.g., >30%) but CPA is bad, test different body videos, scripts, visuals, or music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   If hold rate is low (e.g., <10%) and CPA is bad, people aren't watching past 15 seconds, so test different hooks, creators, visuals, music, or scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   If hook rate is low (e.g., <30%) and CPA is bad, test different hooks, headlines, creators, visuals, or music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Why a Dedicated Campaign is Crucial

The primary reason for having a separate dedicated [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] campaign and an Evergreen campaign is to prevent ads with strong upper-funnel performance but weak lower-funnel performance from negatively impacting your main campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

*   **Preventing Budget Waste:** An ad might have a high hook rate or high install rate (meaning people click or watch the hook), causing [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | Facebook]] to spend heavily on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. However, if these users don't convert to actual trials or subscriptions, such an ad would waste budget in your Evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Isolating Performance Issues:** A dedicated testing campaign allows you to identify creative winners that not only grab attention but also drive conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Only ads that meet your CPA goal with significant spend should be duplicated from the testing campaign into your Evergreen campaign and ad set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The Evergreen campaign should house all your proven creative winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

This structured approach ensures that only truly effective ads are scaled, protecting your main campaign's budget and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. While this is a general [[principles_of_creative_testing_campaigns | creative testing structure]], it can be tweaked to suit specific business situations, such as budget or creative production constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Adding text overlays to [[visual_hooks_in_video_ads | visual hooks]] is a feature designed to enhance the experimentation and performance of video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:01">[03:47:01]</a>. It allows for the bulk application of textual elements onto short visual clips, enabling efficient testing of different [[creating_engaging_text_hooks_in_ads | text hooks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:01">[03:01:01]</a>.

## Purpose of Text Overlays

The primary goal of applying text overlays to [[visual_hooks_in_video_ads | visual hooks]] is to facilitate extensive experimentation on the optimal order and messaging of hooks and body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:01">[03:13:01]</a>. This process aims to identify the most effective combinations that capture audience attention.

## How to Add Text Overlays

The process involves uploading [[visual_hooks_in_video_ads | visual hooks]] and then applying text in bulk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:01">[03:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:01">[03:47:01]</a>.

### Steps for Application
1.  **Upload Visual Hooks**: Users can upload up to 20 raw [[visual_hooks_in_video_ads | visual hooks]] at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:01">[03:53:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:01">[03:56:01]</a>. These hooks are typically around 3 seconds long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:01">[02:38:01]</a>.
2.  **Customize Copy**: [[creating_engaging_text_hooks_in_ads | Text hooks]] can be customized with various messages, such as "three reasons why you can't sleep" or "did you know you needed this to lose 20 lbs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:01">[02:51:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:01">[03:59:01]</a>.
3.  **Edit Text Properties**: Users can choose the font, edit the size, and position the text to ensure it does not block important visuals, especially for specific aspect ratios like 9x16 where text should be in a safe zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:01">[04:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:01">[04:12:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:01">[04:19:01]</a>.
4.  **Add Visual Enhancements**: Options include adding a background color, a border radius, or adjusting shadow effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:01">[04:25:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:01">[04:31:01]</a>.
5.  **Apply in Bulk**: Once customized, the text overlay can be applied to all uploaded [[visual_hooks_in_video_ads | visual hooks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:01">[04:40:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:01">[04:43:01]</a>.

### Integration with Video Ad Creation
After adding text overlays, these new hooks can be used to create [[visual and text hook variations | video ad variations]] by stitching them with existing or new body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:01">[06:57:01]</a>. This allows for testing numerous combinations quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:01">[07:00:01]</a>.

## Measuring Performance

When testing video ads with different text overlays, it is crucial to measure specific metrics to assess effectiveness:

*   **Hook Rate**: This is calculated as the 3-second video view divided by impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:01">[03:24:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:01">[03:27:01]</a>.
*   **Hold Rate**: On platforms like Meta, this is measured by "through-play" divided by impressions, indicating how many people watch past 15 seconds of the video ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:01">[03:30:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:01">[03:32:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:01">[03:37:01]</a>.
*   **CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)**: This is another important metric to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:01">[03:44:01]</a>.

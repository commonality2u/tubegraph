Approaching [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] in 2024 requires a focus on volume and [[creative_diversity_in_ad_strategies | diversity]] to identify high-performing ad variants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## The Need for Volume and Diversity

A recent study by AppsFlyer revealed that out of many ad variants, only one in 50 typically captures 68% of ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This statistic excludes video ads or those with less than $50 in spend, suggesting that in reality, even fewer variants achieve such a high share of spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This highlights the critical need to "crank out as many ads as I can" while maintaining quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

An older Meta study further supports this by indicating that the fastest-growing advertisers tested 11 times more creative per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>. The AppsFlyer study bolsters this finding, emphasizing the necessity of testing more ads than one might initially consider to find the highly effective "needle in the haystack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>. As Alex Hormozi suggests, "volume negates luck," a principle applicable to [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] on platforms like Meta and TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.

## What is Creative Diversity?

[[creative_diversity_in_advertising | Creative diversity]] means utilizing a wide range of ad formats and messages, rather than having everything look, sound, or say the same thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. This includes testing various ad types such as:

*   Static ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>
*   Video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>
*   User-generated content (UGC) ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>
*   3D motion graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>
*   AI-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>
*   "Ugly" ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>
*   Post-it ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>
*   Product-focused ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>

The goal is to test a multitude of different ad types to find what resonates best with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>.

## Managing Creative Volume

When executing a high volume of [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]], it is crucial to keep meticulous track of every ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Implementing a consistent ad naming convention is essential for future analysis to understand which ads performed well over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

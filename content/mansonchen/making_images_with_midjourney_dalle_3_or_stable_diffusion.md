To create your own visual hooks using AI, a common workflow involves generating images with AI models like Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Stable Diffusion XL, and then converting them into short video clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Image Generation Process

### 1. Finding Image Inspiration

The process often begins by seeking inspiration from platforms like [[using_lex_art_for_image_inspiration|Lex.Art]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. On [[using_lex_art_for_image_inspiration|Lex.Art]], users can browse through numerous image visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. A key feature is the ability to copy prompts directly from images that are aesthetically pleasing or inspiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### 2. Generating Images

Once a desired prompt is acquired, it can be used with various AI image generation websites to create unique images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Popular options include:
*   Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   DALL-E 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
*   Stable Diffusion XL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>

Users can generate multiple images and then select the one they prefer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## From Image to Video Hook

### 1. Creating a Video from an Image

After selecting an image, the next step in creating a visual hook involves converting it into a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This can be done using tools such as [[using_runway_ml_to_create_videos_from_images|Runway ML]]'s Gen-2 model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This AI model can transform a still image into a video clip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### 2. Enhancing the Visual Hook

The resulting video is typically a short clip, often around 4 seconds long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Users can then apply their own effects and transitions to this clip to further enhance it and complete the visual hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Performance of Visual Hooks

When assessing the effectiveness of these AI-generated visual hooks, a good hook rate to aim for is 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

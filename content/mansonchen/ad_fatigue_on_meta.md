Advertisers often encounter a common problem where their best-performing ads begin to decline in effectiveness, leading to rising Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This phenomenon, known as ad fatigue, occurs when audiences are exposed to the same ad too many times. Facebook's research indicates that a 60% drop in conversion rate can occur after just four repeated exposures to an ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Many advertisers wait until their CAC becomes excessively expensive before attempting to test new ad creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

To counteract ad fatigue and enable scaling to over $10,000 a day in profitable ad spend, three key techniques can be employed to refresh winning ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. These strategies are crucial given that Facebook has found 50% of ads do not last longer than two days, highlighting the importance of creative volume for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Meta itself recommends adopting [[creative_testing_structure_for_meta_ads | modular creative at scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Refreshing Winning Ads

### 1. Hook Swapping

Once a successful combination of hook, body, call to action, and music is identified, new hooks can be swapped onto that existing, proven combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Since the body and call to action are already known to perform well, testing new hooks allows for reaching new, incremental audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The hook effectively acts as the targeting mechanism, enabling advertisers to maximize the potential of a winning ad concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

*   **Example**: The Simple Intermittent Fasting app successfully used this technique by testing 16 different visual hooks with one consistent text hook, all leading to the same User-Generated Content (UGC) testimonial ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Many other apps and e-commerce companies also utilize this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### 2. Substitute

A winning ad can be transformed into wildly different formats while retaining its core winning trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This approach helps increase ad volume by creating variations of an already successful creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

*   **Examples**:
    *   Convert a winning static ad into a [[video_ad_formula_for_meta | video ad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   Turn a winning video ad into a static ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   Transform static ads into new carousel ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

The "winning trait" that should be kept intact could be the creator, the script, the imagery, or the editing style of the original ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### 3. Combination

Elements from two or three different winning ads can be combined to create a new ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This is analogous to alloying in chemistry, where combining two metals creates a stronger, new metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

*   **Example**: For a men's mental health app, ads featuring shark imagery performed well, as did angles adopting a skeptical point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. By combining these two winning elements—a heavy text overlay with a skeptical message over a shark image—they created their top-performing ad for several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Actionable Steps

To combat ad fatigue and sustain performance, apply these three techniques to the top 25% of ads that exhibit the lowest Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) and highest spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Create a batch of these iterations to test consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

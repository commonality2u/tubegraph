Building a repeatable system is key to growing Facebook ad spend from zero to $100K per month, rather than relying on randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This guide outlines a weekly checklist and essential foundational setups for app founders and performance marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Foundational Setup

Before diving into the weekly checklist, several foundational elements must be correctly established:

### Ad Naming Convention
Set up an ad naming template within Ads Manager to maintain organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. A sample template includes:
*   Concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>
*   Hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>
*   Angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>
*   Type (video, static, carousel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>
*   Aspect Ratio (e.g., 9x6, 1x1, 4x5, PAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>
*   Landing Page (e.g., homepage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>

### [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | Creative Testing Framework]]
Establish a system for objective ad tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. This involves understanding how to set up ad set tests and campaign types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

### Tracking Production
Utilize a Kanban board (e.g., Trello, Asana, ClickUp) to track creative production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. This is crucial for [[scaling_facebook_ads | scaling]] creative output, keeping track of static and video ads, and assigning ownership to creative strategists, editors, designers, and media buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

### [[setting_up_a_facebook_ads_dashboard_for_creative_tests | Creative Dashboard]]
Set up a [[setting_up_a_facebook_ads_dashboard_for_creative_tests | creative dashboard]] to monitor creative tests and track the creative win rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. This can be built within Ads Manager or independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **Creative Win Rate** is calculated as the number of winning ads (meeting KPI goals) divided by the total number of ads tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   Aim for a monthly creative win rate between 10-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### Conversion API Setup
For web-to-app flows, setting up the Conversion API is non-negotiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Tools like Stape.io, Zapier, or Make (formerly Integromat) can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   Send bottom-funnel events (e.g., purchase, start trial) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   Include parameters like Facebook cookie and Facebook click for the highest match rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
*   The Conversion API can capture significantly more conversions than the pixel alone, overcoming limitations from ad blockers or browsers like Safari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

## Weekly Cadence for Facebook Ads

Once the foundations are set, follow this weekly checklist:

### 1. Launch Fresh Ads Weekly
Continuously launch new ads, including both iterations of existing concepts and entirely new concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   Increased ad testing correlates with business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.
*   Start with small budgets for [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creative testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   Increase budgets on ads and ad sets that meet or exceed KPI goals within the [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creative testing]] campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   More ads tested can lead to more purchases in subsequent months without increasing Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

### 2. Become a Student of Ad Libraries
Regularly analyze ad libraries (e.g., Motion App's free plan) to save ads and track brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
*   Avoid blindly copying ads, as their performance might not be known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.
*   Focus on identifying concept trends: observe which concepts competitors keep iterating on or localizing, as this indicates successful investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

### 3. Brainstorm with Mind Maps
Use mind maps for brainstorming sessions with your team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.
*   Consider static ad formats, video formats, universal human motivators for angles, messaging frameworks, and stages of awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.

### 4. Source New Content Weekly
Actively source new content on a weekly basis, aiming for visual diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.
*   **Methods:** Film with an iPhone (B-roll, founder story, selfie videos, green screen), generative AI, User-Generated Content (UGC), voice-overs, and reaching out to creators (e.g., Backstage.com, Fiverr) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
*   **Creative Diversity Framework (Obby Brand):**
    *   **Bottom Left (Low-Fi Static):** Handwritten notes, photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>
    *   **Top Left (Hi-Fi Static):** Designer-produced images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>
    *   **Top Right (Hi-Fi Video):** Studio shoots (expensive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>
    *   **Bottom Right (Low-Fi Video):** UGC videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>

### 5. Implement a Traffic Light System for Iterations
Categorize ads as green, yellow, or red to guide iteration efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.
*   **Green Ads:** Meet your KPI goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.
*   **Yellow Ads:** Close to the KPI goal (e.g., within 25%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.
*   **Red Ads:** Far from the KPI goal (e.g., double CAC, 50% higher CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. Do not work on these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

**Iteration Opportunities for Green/Yellow Ads:**
*   Test new creators on winning scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.
*   Test new scripts on winning creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.
*   Swap new hooks on winning ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.
*   Swap new bodies on winning ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.
*   Test new music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   Combine two winning ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.
*   Try new formats (e.g., winning image to video, winning video to image, winning images to carousel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.

### 6. Utilize Modular Creative Briefs for Video Ads
A basic framework for video ads includes a hook, body, and call to action (CTA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.
*   **Hooks:** Visual metaphors of a problem, unboxing, or oddly satisfying visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
*   **Bodies:** Building blocks of clips that can be used interchangeably or as hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. These can include problem-solution narratives, unique selling propositions (USPs), social proof, and reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.
*   **Call to Action (CTA):** The concluding instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

### 7. Manage Evergreen Campaigns
Winning ads from the [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creative testing]] campaign should be moved into an evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.
*   **Consolidate Post IDs:** Obtain the post ID from the winning ad in the [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creative testing]] campaign and duplicate it into the evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. This is an often overlooked part of ad account consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.
*   **Campaign Type:** Evergreen campaigns can be Advantage Shopping Plus, CBO, or another campaign type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.
*   **Monitoring:** Monitor evergreen campaigns every couple of days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.
    *   Monitor top ads for fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.
    *   Cut "decayed" ads before their Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) becomes too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.
    *   Consider implementing triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.
    *   Adjust bids and budgets weekly or every 3-5 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.
    *   Review 7-day rolling averages of ad, ad set, and campaign level performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.
    *   Implement exclusions via dynamic and static lists to avoid targeting existing users in prospecting campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.

When [[creating_engaging_text_hooks_in_ads | customizing ad hooks]], users can choose from 10 distinct [[creating_effective_ad_messages_and_concepts | copywriting tones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These tones are part of an automatic process for creating video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Tone Selection Process
To select a tone, the user is presented with 10 different [[creating_effective_ad_messages_and_concepts | copywriting tones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. An example of a tone that can be chosen is "assertive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. After a tone is selected, the system initializes clips using AI, kicking off background processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The status of this initialization, which can take up to a minute for AI-generated visuals to finish, is updated for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Once the clips have successfully initialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, the user can proceed to create the final video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

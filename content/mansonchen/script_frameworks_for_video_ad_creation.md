Nine-figure brands utilize a simple video ad formula to create video ads at low cost, often without expensive agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This approach allows for successful, profitable, and highly scalable ads, particularly on platforms like Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Core Video Ad Formula: Hook, Body, CTA

The fundamental formula for video ads is: Hook, Body, Call to Action (CTA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Understanding this structure enables the creation of custom ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

*   **Hook**: Designed to grab attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This can involve visual, text, and audio elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. For example, a visual hook might feature an old man in a red shirt, paired with text like "After decades together, I convinced him to try this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Body**: Conveys the main message or point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This is where [[script_frameworks_for_video_ads | script frameworks]] are primarily applied.
*   **Call to Action (CTA)**: Instructs the viewer on the next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. While important, it's considered less critical than the hook and the initial seconds of the body, as average view durations are often short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

This formula aligns with Meta's recommendation for [[modular_approach_to_video_ad_creation | distributing modular creative at scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. A [[modular_creative_strategy_for_video_ads | modular approach]] allows for easy remixing of video blocks, driving down costs by reusing effective content, and enabling advertisers to [[creating_video_ads_faster | double down on winners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. For instance, 10 hooks, 10 bodies, and 3 CTAs can generate 300 video ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Script Frameworks for the Body

The "body" of the video ad benefits significantly from structured [[script_frameworks_for_video_ads | script frameworks]]. Here are four examples:

### 1. Problem-Solution

This framework was instrumental in a case study with Javi Coffee, showing video ads to be 13 times more incremental than static ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. It's effective for top-of-funnel campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

*   **Problem**: Identify an issue the target audience faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Plunge the Knife and Twist It**: Emphasize the pain points associated with the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Introduce Product**: Present the product as the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: Explain what the user gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Social Proof**: Showcase who is getting results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Urgency**: Provide a reason to act now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### 2. Three Reasons Why (Listicle)

This framework is highly versatile and allows for numerous variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. It can be adapted to "three myths," "three benefits," or "five reasons why," for example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Testimonials can be interwoven between each reason to bolster the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

*   First reason why your product is awesome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   Second reason why your product is awesome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   Third reason why your product is awesome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### 3. Testimonial Mashup

Ideal for building social proof, this framework involves chaining together multiple short testimonials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. These can come from User-Generated Content (UGC) or creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

*   Example: "I lost 35 lbs in one month." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>
*   Example: "Everyone's complimenting me on my skin." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>
*   Example: "I'm matching with too many chicks on Bumble." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>

### 4. Basic Feature-Benefit

This straightforward framework pairs a product feature with its corresponding benefit, explaining why the viewer should care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

*   **Feature One**: Describe an awesome thing your product does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Benefit One**: Explain why anyone should care about that feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Feature Two**: Describe another awesome thing your product does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Benefit Two**: Explain why they should care about that feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

Creating effective performance video ads involves understanding their fundamental structure and leveraging tools to generate numerous variations for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The speaker, who previously worked in growth and creative strategy at Calm and Cash App, is currently bootstrapping a platform to [[creating_performance_video_variations | create performance video ad variations]] at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## General Building Blocks of Video Ads

Performance video ads are generally composed of three main parts:
*   **Hook** The opening segment designed to capture attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Body** The main content or message of the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Call to Action (CTA)** The concluding instruction guiding the viewer on what to do next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Examples of Building Blocks

*   **Hooks:** Can be a visual metaphor of a problem, an unboxing, or an oddly satisfying visual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Body:** Typically features a visual sequence that follows a [[script_frameworks_for_video_ad_creation | script framework]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Common frameworks include:
    *   Problem-Agitate-Solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
    *   Unique Mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
    *   Educational Script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
    *   "3 Reasons Why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   **Call to Action:** Examples include "Shop Now," "Download Now," or "Try for Free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Automating Video Ad Creation with Sovereign

Sovereign is a platform designed to help users [[creating_video_ads_faster | create winning video ads four times faster]] by mixing and matching different combinations of hooks, bodies, and call to actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Key Features for [[automatic_video_ad_creation | Automatic Video Ad Creation]]

1.  **Unlimited Building Block Selection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>: Users can select an unlimited number of hooks, body videos, and CTAs to stitch together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. For example, combining 20 hooks, 10 body videos, and 2-3 call to actions can generate 400-600 video ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  **Projects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>: This feature allows performance creative agencies or in-house teams to organize assets for different [[creating_video_ad_concepts | ad concepts]], new creators, creative testing rounds, or specific clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Projects can be named based on client, creator, video ad concept, or creative round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
3.  **Bulk Add Text to Visual Hooks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>: Users can upload up to 20 raw visual hooks (typically 3 seconds long) and apply text overlays in bulk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This enables [[costeffective_strategies_for_video_ad_content_creation | experimentation]] with different text messages on hooks, such as "Three reasons why you can't sleep" or "Did you know you needed this to lose 20lbs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Users can customize font, size, position, background color, and border for the text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Workflow and Benefits of Sovereign

The platform allows users to:
*   Upload up to 20 clips at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   Select an unlimited number of hooks, body videos, and optional call to action videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   Add audio to each variation, with future capability to make audio a variation itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   Choose aspect ratios such as 1x1, 4x5, 9x16, or 16x9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   Generate video ad variations within one to two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   Variations come with an automatic naming convention (e.g., hook\_name\_body\_name\_CTA\_name\_audio\_file\_name\_aspect\_ratio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, with the option to disable it and use a custom naming convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   Download the created video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

The ability to bulk apply text to visual hooks allows for rapid [[costeffective_strategies_for_video_ad_content_creation | experimentation]] with new hooks, which can then be tested with winning or new body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This process aims to save significant time; one customer created 1600 video ad variations in a quarter, reducing the time a designer would take from 1 hour to 10-15 minutes using Sovereign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Key Metrics for [[improving_video_ad_performance | Improving Video Ad Performance]]

When creating and testing video ads, key metrics to monitor include:
*   **Hook Rate:** Calculated as 3-second video views divided by impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Hold Rate:** Measured on platforms like Meta as through-plays (15-second views) divided by impressions, indicating how many people watch past 15 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **CPA (Cost Per Acquisition):** A fundamental metric for evaluating ad efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

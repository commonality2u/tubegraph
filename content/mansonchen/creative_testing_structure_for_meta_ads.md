This article outlines a structured approach to [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] for Meta ads, which has been used to test 50 to 100 ads per week with significant monthly ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While there isn't a single, one-size-fits-all solution, this [[creative_testing_framework_for_meta_ads | creative testing structure]] can be tailored to individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Dedicated Creative Testing Campaign

To begin, create a dedicated [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creative testing campaign]] within Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Within this campaign, establish multiple "test ad sets" (e.g., Test Adset 1, 2, 3) to house different ad tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Optimization Event
The optimization event for your [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creative testing campaign]] should align with your Evergreen campaign's optimization event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. For example, if your Evergreen campaign optimizes for purchases, your [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creative testing campaign]] should also optimize for purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For app install campaigns, optimizing for trial starts is usually recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Adset Daily Budget
Generally, the daily budget at the adset level should aim to achieve 50 conversions in a week at your average CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. For instance, if your average CPA is $10, an adset daily budget of about $70 is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Although Meta recently changed the learning phase requirement from 50 to approximately 10 conversions per week, having more conversions generally leads to more stable performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. It is still recommended to aim for at least 50 conversions per week on your adset tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Structuring Adset Tests

Ads within each ad set test should focus on one specific variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This approach helps to isolate what is (or isn't) working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Testing Key Variables
*   **Hook**: When testing the hook, aim to vary only one element: the text headline, the visual portion, or the audio portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Body**: The body of the ad comprises the script, music/voiceover, and visual sequence/concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   **Scripts**: Test different copywriting frameworks like Problem-Agitate-Solution, three reasons listicles, unique mechanism educational scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   **Visual Concepts**: Experiment with 3D Motion Graphics, UGC ads, talking head ads, podcast ads, Founder story ads, or skit ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Call to Action (CTA)**: While CTAs can be tested, they are less critical than the hook or the beginning of the ad's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The average video view duration for most ads is typically 5 to 6 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Testing the hook and the start of the body already covers 60% to 75% of your video ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Ad Judgement Metrics

Ads are primarily judged based on their CPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **CPA**: Aim for at least 30 conversions on an ad before deciding to duplicate it into the Evergreen campaign or pause it, ensuring confidence in its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Upper Funnel Metrics
These metrics provide additional insights:
*   **Link Click-Through Rate (CTR)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>
*   **Hook Rate**: 3-second video view divided by impressions (e.g., 30% benchmark) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>
*   **Hold Rate**: Throughplay (15-second video view) divided by impressions (e.g., 10% benchmark) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>

The most important elements to test are hooks (text, visual, audio) and the beginning of the body video, including the first frame or problem statement after the hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Iteration Playbooks

Here are some scenarios and [[iterating_and_improving_meta_ads | iteration]] strategies for managing video ad performance:

*   **Hook Rate is good (>30%), but CPA is bad**: This indicates the hook is effective, but the rest of the ad isn't converting.
    *   **Action**: Test different body videos with the same hook, experimenting with scripts, visuals, or music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Hold Rate is bad (<10%), and CPA is bad**: People are not watching past the first 15 seconds.
    *   **Action**: Test different hooks, creators, visuals, music, or scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Hook Rate is bad (<30%), and CPA is bad**: The ad isn't grabbing initial attention.
    *   **Action**: Test different hooks, headlines, creators, visuals, or music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Duplicating Winning Ads to Evergreen Campaigns

When an ad achieves its CPA goal with a significant amount of spend, it can be duplicated from your testing campaign into your Evergreen campaign and adset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The Evergreen campaign and adset should solely house your creative winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Why Separate Campaigns are Crucial
Maintaining separate dedicated [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creative testing campaigns]] and Evergreen campaigns is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Sometimes, an ad might show excellent upper-funnel performance (high hook rate, high install rate) but fail to convert to lower-funnel events like trial starts or subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. If such an ad is in your Evergreen campaign, Meta's algorithm might heavily spend on it due to good engagement signals (clicks, hook views), even if it's not generating desired conversions for your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This can "wreck" your Evergreen campaign by allocating budget to non-converting ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. A separate testing campaign prevents this by allowing you to validate lower-funnel performance before scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

This general [[creative_testing_framework_for_meta_ads | creative testing structure]] can be adapted to specific business situations, such as budget or creative production constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

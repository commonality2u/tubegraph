Effective hooks are crucial for video ad performance, as a poor hook can lead to ignored ads, increased CPA (cost per acquisition), and ad fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Strategically opening video ads can significantly impact performance, with 93% of marketers currently not doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Simply swapping hooks can decrease CPAs by 30% while refreshing ad creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. One highly effective type of [[importance_of_visual_hooks_in_video_ads | visual hook]] is destruction.

When running [[optimizing_meta_ads_for_subscription_apps | Meta ads]] for app subscriptions, a common pitfall is optimizing for the wrong event, which can lead to a negative Lifetime Value (LTV) to Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) ratio and extended payback periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While broad targeting with [[optimizing_for_purchases_and_trial_starts | purchase optimization]] and Conversion API is often recommended for scaling, issues arise when the optimization signal isn't aligned with the business objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Drawbacks of Standard Free Trial Optimization

Many apps [[optimizing_for_purchases_and_trial_starts | optimize for trials]], installs, or registrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:08">[02:05:08]</a>. While this can reach incremental audiences if purchase-optimized setups have hit diminishing returns, it's very difficult to do correctly and generally only recommended with a strong data science team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

The primary issue is that Meta optimizes for the lowest cost per trial or purchase, but it doesn't understand the audience quality or LTV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This can result in:
*   Declining trial-to-subscribe rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>
*   Refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>
*   No activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>
*   Increased customer support tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>

For example, users might sign up for a free trial with fake or prepaid credit cards, leading to failed charges when the trial ends and no activation for that cohort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This means Meta is finding the wrong audience because the optimization signal isn't tied to the business objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

## Strategies to Improve Audience Quality

To gain more control over the Facebook algorithm and ensure it finds the right audience, consider these tactics:

### 1. Optimize for Qualified Trial Events
Instead of just a trial sign-up, send a [[qualified_trial_events_for_app_optimization | qualified trial event]] to Meta and optimize for that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. This event should be a strong activation metric that typically occurs within 24 to 48 hours after sign-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   Asset uploaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>
*   Project created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>
*   Asset generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>

The goal is to identify an event highly correlated to your subscribe event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

### 2. Bid Multipliers
This is an advanced feature that requires a Facebook representative to whitelist your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. It has been shown to increase trial-to-subscribe rates significantly, for instance, by 20-30% on Android campaigns for apps like Calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### 3. Add Friction or Disqualification in the Signup Flow
Introduce steps in the signup process that can deter low-quality users:
*   **Reduce Free Trial Duration:** Shorten the free trial period (e.g., from 14 days to 7 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
*   **Require Business Email:** Mandate confirmation of a business email address for sign-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
*   **Minimum Spend Threshold:** For service-oriented businesses, add a minimum spend threshold requirement for booking a meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

### 4. Eliminate the Free Trial
Consider removing the free trial entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. This aligns the Meta algorithm most closely with your ultimate business objective â€“ direct payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. To reduce risk for potential customers, offer a money-back guarantee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

Examples of eliminating free trials:
*   **Book a Demo:** For B2B or complex apps, transition to a demo-based onboarding process instead of self-serve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   **Hard Paywall:** Implement a hard paywall where users must pay to use the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

The Opal app, for example, did not initially offer a free trial, instead adding a paywall early on for a relatively expensive subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. They found this to be an effective way to use the subscription as a discovery and product-market fit engine, focusing on metrics like day eight return on ad event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

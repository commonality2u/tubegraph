A key to successful ad campaigns is a structured [[modular_creative_strategy_for_video_ads | modular creative strategy]] that incorporates effective [[visual_treatments_and_hooks_in_advertising | visual hooks]]. This approach aims to lower your Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) by identifying and reusing high-performing ad elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Instead of a "spray and pray" approach, a deliberate testing process helps pinpoint which ad elements are truly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

## Creative Testing Framework

A recommended framework involves separating a creative testing campaign from an Evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Within the testing campaign, ad sets test four different ad variations, with each variation focusing on testing one single element while keeping everything else constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Key Principles of Testing:
*   **Broad Audience** Start with a broad audience in your target country (e.g., US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **KPI Optimization** Optimize for your specific bottom-funnel KPI, such as a purchase, install, lead, or trial start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Conversion Threshold** Allow each ad to run until it achieves at least 20 conversions to get a reliable understanding of its Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Identify Scalable Ads** A winning ad often takes up most of the spend, indicating better engagement and potential for scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Automated Pausing** Pause underperforming ads automatically, for instance, if an ad spends a set amount without a conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Moving Winners to Evergreen** Copy winning ads that meet your performance goals into your business-as-usual (BAU) campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Iteration** Iterate on ads that are close to your CPA goal by introducing new [[visual_treatments_and_hooks_in_advertising | hooks]], scripts, or visual concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Budget Allocation** A good rule of thumb is to dedicate 10% to 20% of your overall paid ads budget to testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Other creative testing frameworks exist, including testing in cheaper countries like India or the Philippines, using upper-funnel objectives (e.g., view content, clicks), testing on different channels (e.g., TikTok), or directly launching new creatives into BAU campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The main takeaway is to follow a structured framework and continually test it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## The 4-Week Creative Testing Roadmap

This roadmap helps identify winning ad elements through a structured approach, enabling a [[modular_approach_to_video_ad_creation | modular approach]] to ad creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Week 1: Message Testing
Message testing is considered the "lowest hanging fruit" for ad testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The goal is to determine which pain points resonate most with your audience.
*   **Control:** Use a simple, static image concept (e.g., a black and white "fake tweet" style) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Test:** Test four different pain points using this simple format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Other simple formats like a Post-it note or iPhone note app can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** Identify the most impactful messaging that drives conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Week 2: Concept Testing
A "concept" refers to any high-level visual distinction, differentiating it from minor iterations like background colors or headlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Test:** Use the winning pain point from Week 1 and test it across different image and video concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Recommendation:** Test two different image concepts and two different video concepts to determine which format performs best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** Identify winning visual concepts, particularly a promising video ad for further iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Week 3: Script Testing
A script is the sales copy or voiceover within a video that aims to convert prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Foundation:** Base scripts off the winning pain point from Week 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Frameworks:** Utilize proven copywriting frameworks such as:
    *   **Problem-Solution:** Text hook, problem, solution, onboarding, benefits, Call to Action (CTA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
    *   **Differentiator:** Text hook, polarization (how others do it), unique mechanism, product introduction, benefits, social proof, CTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
    *   **Pain Point:** Text hook, problem, agitation, product introduction, differentiation, benefit, social proof, CTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Modularity:** Components like benefits and CTAs can be reused across different script frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Test:** Write and test four different scripts using the winning video ad from Week 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** Identify the most effective script for driving conversions.

### Week 4: [[Generating Visual Hooks for Creatives | Visual Hook]] Testing
[[Visual treatments and hooks in advertising | Visual hooks]] are the first 3 seconds of an ad designed to grab attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. They are extremely important for initial engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Examples include burning a marshmallow in reverse, dunking french fries into ketchup, or pouring sugar into a Coke can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. [[Creative visual hooks using ugc and social media formats | Creative visual hooks]] can be very interesting and varied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Measurement:** Use a custom metric called "hook rate" or "thumb stop rate" in Facebook Ads Manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
    *   **Formula:** `3-second video view / impression` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
    *   **Significance:** A higher hook rate indicates that people are stopping their scroll to watch your video, making them more likely to continue watching and be influenced by the script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
    *   **Benchmarks:** A good hook rate benchmark is 30% for B2C, and anything over 20% (aim for 25%) is good for B2B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
*   **Test:** Test four different [[organizing_visual_hooks_for_ads | visual hooks]] using your winning video ad from Week 3, evaluating which one yields the best CAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. [[Importance of testing visual hooks | Testing visual hooks]] is crucial.

## Mastering Modular Creative

By following this roadmap, you will have winning ads that meet your CAC goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. More importantly, you will possess a "menu" of ad elements—including [[visual_treatments_and_hooks_in_advertising | visual hooks]], scripts, image concepts, and pain points/messages—that are proven to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

This knowledge of what works means you are a "master of [[modular_design_in_video_ads | modular creative]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. You can take these winning elements and apply them to new ads, effectively recycling them to increase your ad win rate and drive more profitable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. This systematic approach to [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | using visual hooks and iterations]] begins with a strong creative strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

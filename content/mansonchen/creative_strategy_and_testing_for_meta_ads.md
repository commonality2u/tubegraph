When managing Meta ads, especially with [[broad_targeting_with_meta_ads | broad targeting]], it's crucial to employ effective [[creative_strategy_and_testing_for_meta_ads | creative strategy and testing]] to ensure profitable spend and take control of the Facebook algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The Broad Targeting Trap and Meta's Direction

Meta's media buying is increasingly becoming a "black box," with [[broad_targeting_with_meta_ads | broad targeting]] recommended as the audience setting for scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This typically involves country-level targeting, excluding past purchasers, and avoiding interest targeting or lookalike audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The goal is to provide Meta with the best possible signal through purchase optimization and a Conversion API feed, then supply a large volume of diverse creatives and allow Meta to find the right audience based on those creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

Meta is encouraging the use of Advantage Shopping+ campaigns, which are more streamlined and tailored in their best practices compared to manual sales campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. These campaigns often hide various settings, such as budget allocation (Campaign Budget Optimization), audience targeting (Advantage+ audience), placement targeting (Advantage+ placements), and bid caps (highest volume bidding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## The Pitfall of Optimizing for the Wrong Event

A common mistake is optimizing for the wrong event, such as trials, installs, or registrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. While this *can* reach incremental audiences if your current purchase-optimized setup has hit diminishing returns, it's very difficult to do correctly and should only be attempted with a strong understanding and a trusted data science team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Meta will optimize for the lowest cost per trial or purchase, but it doesn't understand audience quality or Lifetime Value (LTV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. If your optimization signal isn't highly correlated to your true business objective, you might experience:
*   Declining trial-to-subscribe rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   Refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>
*   Lack of activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>
*   Increased customer support tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

This is akin to telling Meta to find "sheep" when you actually want to find "blue sheep in the Himalayas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. For example, optimizing for free trials led to sign-ups with fake or prepaid credit cards, resulting in failed charges and no activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Strategies to Take Back Control of the Algorithm

To guide Meta's algorithm towards your ideal customer profile (ICP), consider these tactics:

### 1. Tailor Creatives for Your ICP
Different demographics engage with different platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. For instance, older individuals tend to be on the Facebook feed, while younger audiences are more prevalent on Instagram Reels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Your [[creative_testing_strategies_for_meta_in_2024 | creative testing strategies]] should reflect this understanding.

### 2. Send Qualified Trial Events to Meta
Instead of a basic trial, send a "qualified trial event" to Meta for optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This could be an activation metric that occurs within 24-48 hours after sign-up, such as an asset uploaded, project created, or asset generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. You should identify what is highly correlated to your ultimate subscribe event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### 3. Utilize Bid Multipliers
If you have a Facebook representative, inquire about bid multipliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This feature significantly increased trial-to-subscribe rates by 20-30% on Android campaigns for apps like Calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. A Python script may be available on Substack for whitelisted users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### 4. Add Friction or Disqualification in the Sign-up Flow
Introducing small barriers can filter out unqualified users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Examples include:
*   Reducing free trial duration (e.g., from 14 to 7 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>
*   Requiring business email confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
*   Adding a minimum spend threshold in Calendly invites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>

### 5. Consider Removing Free Trials
Aligning the Meta algorithm most closely with your business objective can involve removing free trials altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. To mitigate risk for prospects, offer a money-back guarantee instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

This could manifest as:
*   Booking a demo instead of a self-serve flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>
*   Implementing a hard paywall where users must pay to use the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>

For example, the Opal app initially did not offer a free trial, instead implementing an early paywall for a relatively expensive subscription. This approach was used as a "discovery engine" and "product-market fit engine," with a focus on metrics like day eight return on ad event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

When [[evaluating_ad_performance | evaluating ad performance]], focusing solely on metrics like Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) or Impressions can be misleading, especially when aiming for scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A low CPA ad might have minimal spend or purchases, making it an unreliable indicator of overall effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. To address this, a custom metric called "[[ad_score_metric | Ad Score]]" can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Defining Ad Score

[[ad_score_metric | Ad Score]] is a custom metric designed to provide a more comprehensive view of ad performance by considering both volume (purchases) and efficiency (cost per purchase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. While it can be made more complex, a simple formula can achieve 90% of the desired analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Formula

The [[ad_score_metric | Ad Score]] can be created in Facebook Ads Manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The formula is:

> [!NOTE]
> `Ad Score = Purchases / Cost Per Purchase` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>

## Benefits of Using Ad Score

This formula provides several advantages for [[evaluating_ad_performance | evaluating ad performance]]:
*   **Prioritizes Volume**: Ads with a higher number of purchases will automatically receive a higher [[ad_score_metric | Ad Score]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This emphasizes the [[role_of_volume_in_ad_performance | role of volume]] in determining true success.
*   **Rewards Efficiency**: Ads with a lower Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) will also achieve a higher [[ad_score_metric | Ad Score]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Balances Metrics**: If two ads have the same CPA, the ad that generated more purchases will be ranked higher due to its greater volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Easy Ranking**: The [[ad_score_metric | Ad Score]] helps in easily ranking ads against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

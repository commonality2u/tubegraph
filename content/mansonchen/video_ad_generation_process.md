The platform offers an [[automatic_video_ad_creation | automatic way to create video ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It provides a streamlined process for generating video advertisements with AI-powered features.

## Key Features and Updates

Recent updates to the platform include:
*   **Tailored AI Visual Concepts** Tailored AI visual concepts are generated based on user input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This feature is part of the broader [[creating_video_ad_concepts | creating video ad concepts]] and [[animation_and_video_generation | animation and video generation]] capabilities.
*   **Customizable Hooks** Users can customize their video ad hooks by choosing from 10 distinct copywriting tones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Clearer Instructions** The platform now includes clearer instructions on how to use its features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Generation Process

The [[video_ad_creation_workflow | video ad creation workflow]] on the platform follows a step-by-step method, designed to simplify [[creating_video_ads_faster | creating video ads faster]] and facilitate [[iterating_video_ad_concepts | iterating video ad concepts]].

### Step 1: Input Company Information
The user begins by providing basic company details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Company Name:** Specify the name of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. For example, "Chicken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Product/Service Description:** Describe what the company does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, such as "make delicious chicken sandwiches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Step 2: Choose Copywriting Tone
Next, the user selects a copywriting tone for the ad.
*   There are 10 different copywriting tones available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   An example tone chosen is "assertive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Step 3: Initialize Clips (AI Visuals Generation)
After inputting details and selecting a tone, the user initiates the AI processes.
*   Click the "initialize Clips" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   This action kicks off all background processes involving AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   The system provides an updated status indicating the progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   The AI-generated visuals can take up to a minute to finish generating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   Once completed, the clip status changes to "succeeded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Step 4: Create Video (Final Rendering)
The final step involves rendering the complete video.
*   Click "create a video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   The video status will initially show as "queued" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   Once the final video finishes rendering, the status will change to "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   The completed video then becomes available for playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

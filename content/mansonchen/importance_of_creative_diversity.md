[[creative_diversity_in_ad_strategies | Creative strategy testing]] is a key aspect of effective advertising, and understanding the [[importance_of_creative_diversity_in_advertising | importance of creative diversity]] is central to this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Why Creative Diversity Matters

[[creative_diversity_in_advertising | Creative diversity]] is considered "so so so important" because qualitative themes, such as visual themes, script angles, or pain point themes, resonate differently with various demographics, personas, or ideal customer profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Winning ads often possess these distinct qualitative themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Mental Models Guiding Creative Diversity

Three mental models can guide creative strategy testing and implicitly support the development and leverage of creative diversity:

### The Scientific Process
The first mental model emphasizes the [[scientific_process_in_creative_strategy | scientific process]] by isolating and testing only one variable at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For instance, one could test the same script with four different creators or the same video body with four different visual hooks, ensuring all other elements remain consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This approach is vital because an experiment requires a control; testing a new concept and a new script simultaneously makes it impossible to determine which factor influenced performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. While taking "big swings" (testing entirely new concepts) can lead to a lower win rate, it's essential for the exploration phase of testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Conversely, the exploitation phase involves iterating on existing learnings, rather than simply "throwing spaghetti at the wall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This systematic approach contributes to [[databacked_creative_decisionmaking | databacked creative decisionmaking]] by understanding which diverse elements are effective.

### The Alloying Concept
Borrowed from chemistry, the [[alloying_concept_in_creative_strategy | alloying concept]] involves mixing two or more elements to achieve positive combined properties, much like steel is an alloy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. In advertising, this means combining successful creative elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. For example, a men's mental health app found success with image ads featuring sharks and also with a skeptical angle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Combining these led to an ad featuring a skeptical script with heavy text overlay on a shark image, which became their best-performing ad for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This model encourages creating diverse combinations from proven components.

### Natural Selection
The principle of Natural Selection in creative strategy suggests that winning ads have distinct qualitative themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. These themes, whether visual, script angle, or pain point-focused, resonate with specific target demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This highlights the core reason for [[creative_diversity_in_advertising | creative diversity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. From winning ads, one can "take DNA" and inject it into other ads to create new successful ones, similar to parents making a child, and akin to the alloying model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Additionally, slight variations of a winning ad can extend its shelf life, such as swapping out the hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This continuous evolution contributes to maintaining and expanding a diverse portfolio of effective creatives.

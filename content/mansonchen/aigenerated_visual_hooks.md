Traditional approaches often involve testing only three or four hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. However, [[Importance of testing visual hooks | aggressive testing of visual hooks]] is crucial because:
*   50% of ad recall happens within the first two seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

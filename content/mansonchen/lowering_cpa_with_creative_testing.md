This 4-week [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] roadmap is designed to lower your [[cpa_and_scaling_ads | CPA]] by 30% in 30 days or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Who Is This Roadmap For?

This roadmap is intended for advertisers who are:
*   Testing many creatives on Meta but not achieving a lower Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   Finding that media buyer optimizations don't lower CAC because "creative is the new targeting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Optimizing creatives "into a hole," meaning they are not exploring new creative directions and only testing minor changes like color or headline adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Not hitting their CAC targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   In need of more content for ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   Experiencing high opportunity costs because they don't know which messaging and ad elements are truly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   Currently using a "spray and pray" approach with their ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

The goal is to transition from a "spray and pray" approach to a structured [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | testing process]] for profitable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Creative Testing Setup: The Framework

It is generally recommended to separate a [[importance_of_dedicated_creative_testing_campaign | dedicated creative testing campaign]] from an Evergreen (business as usual) campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Campaign Structure
*   **Creative Testing Campaign:** Contains ad sets for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   Within each ad set, test four different ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   Each variation should test **one single thing**, with everything else remaining constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This ensures that a winning ad's success is attributable to the specific element being tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Evergreen Campaign:** Where winning ads are moved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Best Practices for Testing
*   Start the creative testing campaign with a broad audience in your target country (e.g., US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   Optimize for your specific bottom-funnel KPI (e.g., purchase, install, lead, trial start) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   Let each ad run until it achieves at least 20 conversions to get a reliable understanding of its CAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   Identify ads that take up most of the spend; this indicates better engagement and potential for scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   Pause poor-performing ads. Implement [[automated_stoplosses_in_creative_testing | automated stoplosses]] (e.g., if an ad spends $300 without a conversion, pause it) to save money and test a high volume of creatives without burning cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   Copy winning ads that meet your performance goals into your Evergreen campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   Continue running the winning ad in the creative testing campaign to avoid performance fluctuations in your main account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   Repeat the testing steps at your desired tempo. A good rule of thumb is to dedicate 10% to 20% of your overall paid ads budget to testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Alternative Creative Testing Frameworks
Other [[effective_creative_testing_strategies_on_facebook | creative testing strategies]] exist, each with pros and cons:
*   Testing in a cheaper country (e.g., India or the Philippines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   Testing with an upper-funnel objective first (e.g., view content or clicks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   Testing on a different channel (e.g., TikTok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   Launching new creatives directly into business-as-usual campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

The key takeaway is to follow a framework and consistently test your approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Creatives should be constructed to measure the performance of each element, with each variation testing one single thing at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## 4-Week Creative Testing Roadmap

### Week 1: Message Testing
Message testing is considered the "lowest hanging fruit" for testing ads, as messages are often the reason a prospect converts to a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** To identify the most impactful pain points your product alleviates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Control Setup:** For scientific testing, establish a control. For this week, the control is a simple static image concept, such as a black and white "fake tweet" style image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Homework:**
    1.  Come up with four different pain points in your messaging. You can test up to 8, 12, or 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
    2.  Use a simple format like the fake tweet image, a Post-it note, or an iPhone note app to test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    3.  Test these ads and aim for up to 20 conversions per ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### Week 2: Concept Testing
A "concept" is defined as any high-level visual distinction, such as different overall visual styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Minor changes like background colors, headlines, or aspect ratios are considered iterations, not new concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** To test the winning pain point from Week 1 on different image, video, and carousel concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Homework:**
    1.  Create four different concepts this week, keeping the message consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
    2.  Test two different image concepts and two different video concepts to determine which format performs better for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
    3.  Keep video ads shorter for now. Scripts will be expanded upon in Week 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
    4.  Run ads in separate ad set tests and aim for 20 conversions per ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Week 3: Script Testing
A "script" refers to the sales copy or voiceover that runs throughout the video, converting prospects into customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Scripts are based on proven copywriting frameworks and should leverage the winning pain point from Week 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Script Frameworks:**
    *   **Problem-Solution:** Text hook > Problem > Solution > Onboarding/Benefits > Call to Action (CTA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
    *   **Differentiator:** Text hook > Polarize (how others do it) > Unique Mechanism > Product Introduction > Benefits > Social Proof > CTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
    *   **Pain Point:** Text hook > Problem > Agitate (twist the knife) > Product Introduction > Differentiate Product > Benefit > Social Proof > CTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   These frameworks allow for reusing components (e.g., benefits, CTA) across different scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Homework:** Write four different scripts to test with the winning or promising video ad from Week 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

### Week 4: Visual Hook Testing
Visual hooks are elements occurring in the first 3 seconds of an ad that are crucial for grabbing attention and stopping the user's scroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Dunking french fries into ketchup, pouring sugar into a Coke can, mixing reverse paint dripping on a white cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Measurement:**
    *   Create a custom metric in Facebook Ads Manager called "Hook Rate" or "Thumb Stop Rate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
    *   **Formula:** 3-second video view / Impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
    *   A higher hook rate indicates that people are stopping their scroll, are more likely to keep watching, and thus more likely to be sold by your script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
    *   **Benchmarks:** 30% hook rate is good for B2C; anything over 20% is good for B2B, aiming for 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
*   **Homework:** Test four different visual hooks from your winning video ad from Week 3 and determine which one has the best CAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

## Conclusion

By following this roadmap, you should have winning ads that meet or beat your CAC goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. You will also build a "menu" of ad elements—including visual hooks, scripts, image concepts, and pain points/messages—that are proven to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

This process enables you to become a "master of modular creative," meaning you can recycle winning elements from one ad into brand new ads, increasing your ad win rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. More winning ads ultimately lead to more profitable growth, all stemming from a strong [[principles_of_creative_testing_campaigns | creative testing strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

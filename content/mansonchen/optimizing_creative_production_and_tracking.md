To scale Facebook ad spend to $100K per month, it is essential to build a repeatable system for ad success, rather than relying on randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This approach is beneficial for app founders and performance marketers alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Foundations for Success

Before delving into the weekly checklist, several foundational elements must be correctly established:

### Ad Naming Convention
Set up a clear ad naming template in Ads Manager. A suggested template includes:
*   Concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   Hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
*   Angle Type (video, static, carousel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
*   Aspect Ratio (e.g., 9x16, 1x1, 4x5, or placement asset customization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   Landing Page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

### [[importance_of_dedicated_creative_testing_campaign | Creative Testing Framework]]
It's crucial to set up an objective system for ad tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This includes understanding how to create ad set tests and campaign types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Tracking Production
To scale [[costeffective_strategies_for_video_ad_content_creation | creative production]], use a simple Kanban board on platforms like Trello, Asana, or ClickUp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This helps keep track of static and video ads, assign ownership, and manage roles like creative strategists, editors, designers, and media buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Creative Dashboard
Set up a creative dashboard, which can be built within Ads Manager or custom-coded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This dashboard should track creative tests and monitor the creative win rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The creative win rate is defined as the number of winning ads (meeting KPI goals) divided by the total number of ads tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Aim for a monthly win rate of 10-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Conversion API Setup
For a web-to-app flow, setting up the Conversion API is non-negotiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Tools like Stape.io, Zapier, or Make (formerly Integromat) can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. When building via API calls, send bottom-funnel events (e.g., purchase, start trial) with Facebook cookie and click parameters to maximize match rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The Conversion API can capture significantly more conversions than the pixel alone, overcoming limitations from ad blockers or browsers like Safari and Firefox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Weekly Cadence for Ad Scaling

### Launch Fresh Ads Weekly
Continuously launch fresh ads, mixing new concepts with iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Historical data shows that testing more ads correlates with business growth for apps and subscription brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. One subscription brand increased monthly spend from $50K to $95K within 30 days without increasing CAC by implementing a creative testing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Creative Testing Campaign
Start with small budgets in the creative testing campaign and gradually increase budgets on ads and ad sets that meet or exceed KPI goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### [[databacked_creative_decisionmaking | Creative Strategy]] and Sourcing
*   **Study Ad Libraries:** Regularly monitor ad libraries (e.g., Motion App's free plan) to identify concept trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Focus on concepts that brands consistently iterate on or localize, as this indicates their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Mind Maps for Brainstorming:** Use mind maps with your team to brainstorm new creative ideas. Consider static and video formats, universal human motivators for angles, messaging frameworks, and stages of awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Source New Content Weekly:**
    *   Film content using an iPhone (B-roll, founder stories, selfie videos, green screen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
    *   Explore [[ai_tools_for_creative_production_and_testing | generative AI]] for B-roll, UGC, or voiceovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   Reach out to creators via platforms like Backstage.com or Fiverr for motion graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
    *   Prioritize visual diversity, considering different content types (podcast, street interviews) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
    *   Think about a creative diversity framework encompassing low-fi static (e.g., notebook photo), hi-fi static (designer-produced), hi-fi video (studio shoot), and low-fi UGC video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### [[creating_performance_video_variations | Creative Iterations]] with a Traffic Light System
Use a "traffic light" system to guide iterations on existing ads:
*   **Green Ads:** Meet your KPI goal. Iterate on these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Yellow Ads:** Almost meet the goal (e.g., within 25% of KPI). Iterate on these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Red Ads:** Far from the goal (e.g., double your CAC). Do not work on these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

**Iteration opportunities for green and yellow ads:**
*   Test new creators on winning scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   Test new scripts on winning creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   Swap new hooks on winning ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   Swap new bodies on winning ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   Test new music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   Combine two winning ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   Try new formats: convert a winning image to video, video to image, or images to a carousel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

### [[modular_creative_strategy_for_video_ads | Modular Creative Briefs]] for Video Ads
A basic framework for a video ad includes a hook, body, and call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Hooks:** Can be visual metaphors for a problem, unboxing, or an oddly satisfying visual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Bodies:** Comprised of building blocks of clips that can be used interchangeably or even as hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. These typically include problem/solution, unique selling propositions, social proof, and reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Evergreen Campaign Management
Winning ads (green ads from the traffic light system) should be moved into an evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Consolidate Post IDs:** Obtain the post ID from winning ads in the creative testing campaign and duplicate them into the evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. This is an often overlooked part of ad account consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Monitor Evergreen Campaigns:** Monitor these campaigns every few days, though daily changes are not necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Performance Monitoring:**
    *   Monitor top ads for fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
    *   Cut underperforming ads before CAC becomes too expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
    *   Consider implementing triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
    *   Adjust bids and budgets every 3-7 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
    *   Review 7-day rolling averages for ad, ad set, and campaign level performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
    *   Implement exclusions via dynamic and static lists to avoid targeting existing users in user acquisition campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

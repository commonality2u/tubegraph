This article outlines the optimal campaign types and adset settings for [[creative testing for Facebook ads | creative testing]] on Facebook, aiming to prevent wasted ad spend and enhance performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The strategies discussed have been successfully applied at Unicorn B2C apps like Comm and Cash App <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, helping a subscription brand increase monthly spend from $50K to $95K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, and a nutrition app grow from $3K to $60K monthly spend on Facebook ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Challenge of Creative Testing

Many new advertisers struggle with [[creative testing in Facebook ads | creative testing]] and often waste money because they don't know how to set up an effective [[principles_of_creative_testing_campaigns | creative testing campaign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A key issue is that the Facebook algorithm operates on a "winner take all" principle, meaning one or two ads in an ad set will receive the majority of the spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Campaign Type to AVOID for Creative Testing: Advantage Shopping+ (ASC)

The campaign type to avoid for [[facebook_creative_testing_strategies | creative testing]] is the Advantage Shopping Plus (ASC) campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Why ASC is Ineffective for Creative Testing

*   **Winner-Take-All Behavior:** If 50 ads are uploaded into an ASC ad set, typically only one of them will receive most of the spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Probabilistic Algorithm:** Facebook promises to find the winning ad for you, but its algorithm is probabilistic and can make mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The more ads you include, the higher the chance it picks the wrong one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Skewed by Early Metrics:** Early funnel metrics like click-through rate and view duration can significantly skew delivery, even if they don't lead to conversions (e.g., clickbaity ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Low Success Rate:** With 50 ads in an ad set, there's only about a 2% chance Facebook will pick the "right" ad immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Case Study: The Adtech App Founder's Mistake

An adtech app founder used an AI ad generator to create many ads but struggled with how to test and iterate on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. When running [[creative testing in marketing campaigns | creative testing]] in an Advantage Shopping Plus campaign, the first three ads that received spend yielded a high cost per trial of $40-$50, which was unsustainable <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Fortunately, after pausing the initial three, the fourth ad generated a cost per trial of $8, which was five to six times better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This highlights the risk of relying on ASC for finding winning creatives.

## Recommended Campaign Type for Creative Testing: Adset Budget Optimization (ABO)

The recommended campaign type for [[creative testing for Facebook ads | creative testing]] is the Adset Budget Optimization (ABO) campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Benefits of ABO for Creative Testing

*   **Control Over Adset Budget:** ABO allows you to set the daily budget for each adset within the campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Higher Chance of Success:** If an adset test includes four ad variants, you have a 25% chance of Facebook picking the right one upfront, significantly higher than with ASC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Objective Pausing:** ABO enables quickly and objectively pausing underperforming ads using triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **More Chances to Find Winners:** While it may lead to more upfront spend, ABO provides more opportunities to find the best-performing ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Recommended ABO Settings for Creative Testing

*   **Targeting:** Test one country and one language (e.g., US in English) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Once a winning ad is found, it can be localized and moved to evergreen campaigns for other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Daily Budget:** Start a [[creative testing for Facebook ads | creative testing]] adset with a daily budget of $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Bidding:** Use auto bidding; do not enter a value for cost per result goal or a bid cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Scaling Campaigns with Advantage Shopping+

While ASC is unsuitable for [[creative testing for Facebook ads | creative testing]], it is ideal for scaling campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

*   **Purpose:** In a scaling campaign, every ad within the ad set should have already proven itself in the [[creative testing in Facebook ads | creative testing]] campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Confidence in Performance:** Since all ads are pre-vetted, it doesn't matter which one Facebook picks in the scaling campaign, as you are confident it will have a low Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Managing Ad Fatigue:** If a winning ad starts to fatigue, it can be paused, allowing another proven ad to take its place and continue spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

By understanding the distinct roles of ABO and ASC campaigns, advertisers can implement a more effective and less wasteful [[facebook_creative_testing_strategies | creative testing strategy]] on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

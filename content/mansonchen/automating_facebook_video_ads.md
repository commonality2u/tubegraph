To [[scaling_facebook_ads | scale a Meta ad account]] 10x profitably, a tool is being developed to [[automating_video_ad_creation_with_sovran | automate the performance video creation flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This system aims to simplify and speed up the process of [[creating_performance_video_ads | creating performance video ads]] for testing and deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Core Functionality

The [[tools_for_automating_video_ad_creation | tool]] combines various video components, including:
*   Hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   Body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>
*   Call-to-action clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   Music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>

It then creates all possible variations of these components for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Users can review all combined assets on a dedicated screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. A crucial feature for [[optimizing_and_scaling_facebook_ad_campaigns | performance marketing]] is the ability to set a naming convention, which is vital for isolating different variables being tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The system can generate hundreds or dozens of videos and allows for quick download of all created assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Five-Step Creation Process

The process for [[automatic_video_ad_creation | automatic video ad creation]] is described as a very simple five-step flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>:

1.  **Upload Building Blocks**: Users upload their "hooks" into a building block bucket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, along with body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, and call-to-action end cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Audio files, including music or voiceovers, can also be uploaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
2.  **Select Clips and Adjust Settings**: Users select the hooks they want to stitch together with body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. A gear icon allows for trimming clips and adjusting volume levels for hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, call-to-actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, and audio files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
3.  **Choose Aspect Ratio**: The final aspect ratio for export can be selected, such as 9x16 for Instagram stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
4.  **Review and Finalize Naming Convention**: A review screen allows for final adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The naming convention is critical for [[importance_of_testing_and_iteration_in_facebook_video_ads | performance marketers]] to track every variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Predetermined dropdown selections like CTA name, body name, audio name, and aspect ratio are available, and custom fields can be added for comprehensive variation tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
5.  **Create Video Ads**: The system indicates the number of combinations being made and the credits deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. After hitting "create video ads," the videos begin to appear within a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, facilitating [[creating_video_ads_faster | faster video ad creation]].

To achieve significant financial success with [[facebook_advertisement_strategies | Facebook ads]], like companies such as Loop, Better Me, and Headway, it's crucial to understand their approach to [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creative testing]] hundreds, even thousands, of ads per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. After managing over $100 million in profitable Facebook ad spend and testing tens of thousands of ads, this guide reveals the "invisible traits" of highly successful creative teams, applicable whether you're an app founder, e-commerce founder, or a new marketer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Foundation of Success: A Testing-First Culture

Many believe that successful companies like BetterMe or Headway thrive due to large marketing teams, pixel-perfect designs, or insane branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. However, the true foundation of success lies in a specific culture and mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

> [!tip] Customers Care About Themselves
> This culture understands a fundamental truth: your customers don't care about your brand colors, fonts, or mission as much as you might think. They care about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Encourage Wild Ideas

Putting too many "guard rails" on creative output can kill creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Creativity is essential for finding great ideas and discovering what truly resonates with your audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

*   **Average content is ignored:** AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude are excellent for generating average content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Wild ideas set brands apart:** Humans are still best at generating wild, innovative ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Create an environment where these ideas are encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Let Data Decide, Not Gatekeepers

Avoid having subjective gatekeepers for performance creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. For performance marketers, the data should determine whether an ad works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Personal intuition often fails; an ad you think will fail might scale to $10,000 a day, while one you think will crush it might get no spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Starting Your Experimentation

Once you embrace a [[creative_testing_in_facebook_ads | testing first culture]], the next step is to start experimenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Nail Your Core Message First

People often get too caught up in what their ad looks like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. If you nail your message first, [[optimizing_and_scaling_facebook_ad_campaigns | scaling]] becomes much easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

*   **Be clear and concise:** Avoid being too clever, as confusion will cause people to scroll past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Message impact:** The message impacts approximately 2/3 to 3/4 of your ad performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Focus on compelling copy:** Identify what truly grabs attention and resonates with your audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Master Static Ads Before Video

It is highly recommended to get good at static ads before moving on to video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

*   **Benefits of statics:** They are cheap, fast, and easy to create and test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* A post-it note ad, a screenshot of Apple Notes text, or a piece of paper printed and pasted onto someone's back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Complexity of video:** Video ads are complex, involving many dimensions:
    *   Low-fi vs. Hi-fi (studio shoots) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>
    *   Creative briefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>
    *   Video editors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>
    *   Duration, pacing, script, problem statement, solution statement, hook, and audio hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>
    Nailing your message with statics first makes the transition to video much easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Iterating and [[optimizing_and_scaling_facebook_ad_campaigns | Scaling Facebook Ads]]

Once you identify what's working, the biggest mistake is ignoring these signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Double Down on What's Working

Focus on ads with a low Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) or a CPA around 25% of your target CPA goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### Ad Categorization: Red, Yellow, Green

A simple red, yellow, green system can help manage your ads:
*   **Red Ads:** Have a CPA that is too high and are unlikely to reach your goal, even with iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Yellow Ads:** Are close to your CPA goal (e.g., around 25% of it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. It can take up to three rounds of iteration on a concept to produce a winning ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Green Ads:** Are currently [[scaling_facebook_ads | scaling]] in evergreen campaigns or have passed your [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creative testing]] campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. These ads contain winning elements, and at least half of your ad focus should be on iterating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### Examples of Iterations

*   **Remix Video Blocks:** Video ads typically follow a structure: hook, body (main content), and call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
    *   If a winning hook (e.g., >30% hook rate) isn't working, test it with new body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   If a body video has a high hold rate but isn't converting, test different hooks with it to see if it resonates with a new audience segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Winning Script, New Creator:** If you have a winning script that isn't performing as expected, try using it with different creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
    *   *Example:* A company found a winning ad concept (a skit) that they couldn't successfully iterate with the same creator, despite trying different visual and text hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. By taking the same script and having different creators perform it, they consistently produced new winning ads that scaled as much as or more than the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## Next Steps

While this covers the initial approach of "nobody cares, just test," understanding how to analyze your [[effective_creative_testing_strategies_on_facebook | Facebook creative testing]] data is crucial as you accumulate more information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. The next step involves analyzing key metrics and confidently [[optimizing_facebook_ads_for_better_cost_per_acquisition | scaling]] your winners, often using Facebook's free ad reporting dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

Nine-figure brands efficiently create video ads at a low cost by utilizing a simple yet effective formula and a [[modular approach to video ad creation | modular approach to video ad creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This strategy helps run successful, profitable, and highly scalable Facebook ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Core Video Ad Formula

The fundamental formula for video ads is **Hook, Body, Call to Action (CTA)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Understanding this allows for the creation of unique ad formulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

*   **Hook**: Grabs attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Body**: Conveys the main message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Call to Action**: Instructs the viewer on the next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

This structure allows advertisers to "hack" the Meta algorithm, as Meta itself recommends this approach for distributing [[modular_design_in_video_ads | modular creative]] at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For instance, combining 10 hooks, 10 bodies, and 3 CTAs can lead to 300 video ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Why Go Modular?

Adopting a [[modular approach in video advertising | modular approach in video advertising]] offers several benefits:

*   **Easy Remixing**: Video blocks are interchangeable, allowing for quick adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Cost Reduction**: It drives down costs by enabling the reuse of effective content rather than constantly paying for new material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This is a key aspect of [[costeffective_strategies_for_video_ad_content_creation | cost-effective strategies for video ad content creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Double Down on Winners**: Successful hooks, body videos, and CTAs can be remixed and reused to maximize performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Video Ads vs. Static Ads

Video ads can be 13 times more incremental than [[static_and_video_ad_formats_for_creative_strategy | static ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. While static ads might appear to perform similarly in ad managers or through last-click attribution, lift studies reveal the true impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. For example, a case study by House.io with Javi Coffee showed that video ads were 13 times more incremental than static ads in driving results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This incrementality is often not visible in standard ad manager metrics and requires a lift study to ascertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Deconstructing the Formula: Components of Modular Video Ads

### Hooks

The hook is the initial part of a video ad designed to capture attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. [[visual_hooks_and_modular_creative_strategy | Visual hooks and modular creative strategy]] is crucial here. True Classic, for instance, tests various visual, text, and audio hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

*   **Example**: True Classic might use two visual hooks, four text hooks, and audio variations (e.g., male and female voiceovers reading the text hooks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This approach can generate 16 hook variations leading into the same body video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Body: Script Frameworks

The body of the ad delivers the core message and can be built using various [[script frameworks for video ads | script frameworks for video ads]]. Here are four popular ones:

#### 1. Problem-Solution

This framework begins by highlighting a problem, intensifying it, and then introducing the product as the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. It can then expand to include benefits, social proof, and urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This is effective for top-of-funnel campaigns, as seen in the Javi Coffee case study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

*   **Structure**: Problem → Product Introduction → Benefits → Social Proof → Urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

#### 2. Three Reasons Why (Listical)

A highly versatile and effective [[script frameworks for video ad creation | script frameworks for video ad creation]] for generating numerous variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Variations can include "three myths," "three benefits," or "five reasons why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Testimonials can also be interjected between each reason to bolster its credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

*   **Structure**: Reason 1 (Product is awesome) → Reason 2 (Product is great) → Reason 3 (Product is so great) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

#### 3. Testimonial Mashup

This framework leverages social proof by chaining together multiple testimonials from users or creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

*   **Example**:
    *   "I lost 35 lbs in one month." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>
    *   "Everyone's complimenting me on my skin." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>
    *   "I'm matching with too many chicks on Bumble." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
    *   "I gained 20 yards with this new driver." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>

#### 4. Feature-Benefit

A straightforward framework that pairs a product feature with its corresponding benefit, explaining why the viewer should care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

*   **Structure**: Feature 1 (What the product does) → Benefit 1 (Why it matters) → Feature 2 → Benefit 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Call to Action (CTA)

The CTA concludes the video ad, telling viewers what to do next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. While perhaps less critical than the hook or the initial body segments (due to average view durations of around 5-6 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, testing different CTAs is advisable, especially with tools that facilitate easy variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

By applying these modular principles, brands can enhance their [[creating_video_ad_concepts | creating video ad concepts]] and scale their advertising efforts efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

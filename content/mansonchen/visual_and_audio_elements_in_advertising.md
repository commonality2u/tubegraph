Dr. Squatch, a prominent soap brand primarily targeting men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, effectively utilizes [[elements_of_image_and_video_ads | visual and audio elements]] in its advertising strategy to engage its target audience. Their video ads are created in a modular way, consisting of Hooks, Body videos, and a Call to Action (CTA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Modular Ad Creation

The philosophy behind Dr. Squatch's video ads is modularity, breaking down the ad into distinct components:
*   **Hooks:** Designed to capture immediate attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Body Videos:** Provide information and build interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Call to Action (CTA):** Prompts the viewer to take the next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

This modular approach allows for systematic testing and iteration of different components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. When testing video ads, it is crucial to test only one variable at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Hooks: Capturing Attention

Dr. Squatch employs a variety of [[visual_treatments_and_hooks_in_advertising | visual and audio hooks]] to stop the scroll of single male customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The core customer desire they address is attracting a girlfriend by smelling good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Text Hooks
Dr. Squatch tests several text-based [[using_text_and_audio_in_ads | hooks]] for their deodorant products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:
*   "Women will go feral for this natural deodorant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   "Do you know why she likes it natural?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   "Why women will go feral for this Dr. Squatch deodorant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   "3 reasons this deodorant is dangerous for your love life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>

The common visual styling for these text hooks includes white text on a blue background, or white text with a black stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The text is typically placed at the top of the 9x16 safe zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Visual Hooks
[[visual_hooks_in_video_ads | Visual hooks]] are considered very important for stopping the scroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Dr. Squatch frequently uses split frames in their [[static_and_video_ad_formats_for_creative_strategy | video ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Left side:** Consistently features a visual of deodorant or deodorant peeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Right side:** Features visuals designed to capture attention and relate to the target audience's desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>:
    *   A naked hairy old man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   A girl in a towel smelling deodorant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   A girl smelling a man's armpit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

The purpose of these [[importance_of_visual_hooks_in_video_ads | visual hooks]] is to make single men stop scrolling and engage with the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Audio Hooks
Audio [[using_text_and_audio_in_ads | hooks]] are also a crucial [[elements_of_image_and_video_ads | element]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. A common audio hook used by Dr. Squatch, delivered in a girl's voice, includes:
*   "This is what a man should smell like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
*   "I will literally jump on any man wearing this scent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>

## Body Videos: Building Interest

Following the hooks, the body videos serve as an "onramp" or "control" segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Dr. Squatch's body videos often take the form of a listicle, such as "3 reasons why," or an educational explainer about natural ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

The common visual themes in their body videos are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>:
1.  Attractive women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
2.  Men applying deodorant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
3.  Women attracted to the men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Call to Actions (CTAs): Driving Conversion

Dr. Squatch uses distinct call to actions at the end of their modular ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
1.  "Just click this video right now to change your pit game forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
2.  "These deodorants sell out quick so I'd hop on this while you can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

Both CTAs are accompanied by a visual lineup of Dr. Squatch deodorant products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Creative Strategy: Modularity and Iteration

Top advertisers like Dr. Squatch think in a modular way, allowing them to combine various text hooks with the same body scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. They can play around with the coherence levels of their script and even use the same video clips in different orders to maximize the effectiveness of existing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Winning ads are a result of this process, ensuring that building blocks of hooks, body videos, and CTAs are tested one variable at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

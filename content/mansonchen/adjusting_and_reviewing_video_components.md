When [[creating_performance_video_variations | creating performance video variations]], a crucial step is the ability to adjust and review individual video components before generating the final ad creatives. This process allows for precise control over the output and is essential for effective [[Optimizing Creative Production and Tracking | performance marketing]] and [[testing_strategies_for_video_ad_components | testing strategies]].

## The Review Screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

After combining various video assets like hooks, body videos, and call-to-action clips, a review screen allows users to examine all the components being combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This screen serves as a final checkpoint where further settings adjustments can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Adjusting Video Components

Individual video and audio clips can be fine-tuned before final compilation:

*   **Trimming Clips** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>: Users can trim video segments to optimize their duration.
*   **Adjusting Volume Levels** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>: Audio levels for clips can be modified to ensure balance and clarity.
*   **Applying Settings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>: These adjustments can be applied to various elements, including:
    *   Hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
    *   Body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>
    *   Call-to-action clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
    *   Audio files (music or voiceovers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   **Choosing Aspect Ratio** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>: Before export, the desired aspect ratio for the final video ad can be selected, such as 9x6 for Instagram stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Naming Conventions for Performance Marketing

A critical aspect of the review process is setting a robust naming convention for the generated video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This is vital for [[Optimizing Creative Production and Tracking | performance marketing]] because it allows marketers to isolate and track the different variables being tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Key features of naming conventions include:
*   **Tracking Variables** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>: It enables [[Optimizing Creative Production and Tracking | performance marketers]] to keep precise track of every variable under test.
*   **Predetermined Selections** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>: Options like CTA name, body name, audio name, and aspect ratio can be automatically included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Custom Fields** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>: The ability to add custom fields allows for even more granular tracking of every variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Once adjustments and naming conventions are finalized, the tool can generate all possible video variations, whether dozens or hundreds, for download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

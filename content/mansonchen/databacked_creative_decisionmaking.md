For those involved in [[creative_strategy_and_datadriven_systems | creative strategy]] and growth, a significant insight is leveraging [[mind_maps_for_creative_strategy | mind maps]] to inform creative decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This approach, which may be unique to the speaker's methodology, helps visualize and track the performance of various ad elements, leading to data-backed improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Mind Map Approach to Creative Strategy

[[Mind maps for creative strategy | Mind maps]] are particularly useful in [[creative_strategy_and_datadriven_systems | creative strategy]] due to the numerous dimensions available for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. These dimensions include:
*   **Messaging angles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Offer scripts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Hooks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>
*   **Static formats** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   **Video formats** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   **Duration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   **Visual treatments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   **Audio** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>

This visual organization helps in identifying what is working, what isn't, and areas for iteration and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The ultimate goal is to combine proven elements to create a winning video ad, confident that elements that have worked in the past will lead to a higher creative win rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Categorizing Creative Elements
A key aspect of this method is categorizing creative dimensions based on their performance, using a "relative proven" spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>:

*   **Scalers**: Elements that reliably scale a creative concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **What Works**: Proven elements that consistently perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Middle of the Road**: Variations where some instances meet cost-per-acquisition (CPA) goals, while others do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Don't Work**: Elements that consistently fail despite testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Currently Testing**: Elements actively being evaluated for performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Ideas Bucket**: A repository for new concepts, hooks, audio, visual treatments, scripts, and formats to be tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Examples of Creative Dimensions for Testing
The mind map includes various categories for different ad components:

### Static Formats
Examples include:
*   US versus them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
*   Before after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
*   Post-it notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
*   Tweet style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
*   Apple notes style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
*   WhatsApp conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   iMessage conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>

### Video Formats
These can include:
*   Before after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
*   US Versus Them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>
*   Founder story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>
*   User-Generated Content (UGC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, including [[ai_tools_for_creative_production_and_testing | AI-generated UGC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, which is noted to perform comparably to regular UGC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Scripts
Various script frameworks can be tested:
*   Listicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>
*   Problem-Agitate-Solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>
*   Before after bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
*   Feature-Advantage-Benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>

### Visual Treatments
These refer to specific visual styles or effects:
*   Split-frame concept (e.g., video game on bottom, podcast clip on top) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>
*   Kaleidoscope effect on the visual hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>

### Hooks
Hooks can be further categorized into text, visual, and audio hooks, but are generally grouped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Examples of text hooks include "You in three months" or "Ever dreamed of playing your favorite songs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Audio hooks could be trending music or viral audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Combining Elements for Success
By continuously testing and categorizing creative elements, marketers gain a deeper understanding of what works and what doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This enables them to iterate on "middle of the road" performers and combine successful elements, such as a high-performing hook with a specific script and format that has consistently done well, to achieve a higher win rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This systematic approach provides conviction and clarity for future testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

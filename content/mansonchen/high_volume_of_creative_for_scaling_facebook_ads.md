To [[Scaling Facebook Ads | scale Meta]] profitably, a high volume of creative content is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This necessity arises from constant competition with both paid and organic content in the feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The most effective way to achieve profitable [[Scaling Facebook Ads | scaling]] on Meta is to lower the cost per new ad creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Ads are fundamentally a numbers game, requiring advertisers to test more ads without overspending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. A study by Appsflyer revealed that less than 2% of ads generate over 68% of ad spend, emphasizing the need for more "shots on goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Creative strategists are often incorrect more often than right, highlighting the importance of a repeatable, cost-effective process to identify winning ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Modular Approach to Video Ads

A significant amount of time and money is often wasted in creating video ads, which can be avoided by adopting a modular approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This strategy treats video ads as building blocks, similar to Lego pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Every video ad typically consists of three main components:
*   A Hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   A Body Video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   A Call to Action (CTA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

These video blocks can be continuously reused, with their effectiveness measured using "soft metrics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This method allows for the creation of new video ads simply by reconfiguring the video timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, allowing for mix-and-match combinations of clips rather than creating everything from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This approach drastically reduces ad creative costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Key Metrics for Evaluating Creative Performance in Facebook Ads

Measuring specific metrics helps in optimizing the modular components:

*   **Hook Rate**: A custom metric in Facebook defined as a 3-second video view divided by impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
    *   If the hook rate is below 30%, test by swapping out only the hook while keeping other elements constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Hooks can include visual metaphors for a problem, unboxing clips, or oddly satisfying content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Hold Rate**: Defined as a through play or a 15-second video view divided by impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
    *   If the hold rate is below 10%, test by swapping out the body while keeping everything else the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Body content can start with an unboxing video, transition into benefits, then a product demo, and finally, results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**:
    *   If the CTR is below 1%, test by swapping out the call to action while maintaining other elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

By analyzing data from these metrics, advertisers can continuously improve their ad performance over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Sourcing Creative Assets

The task of compiling creative assets can be achieved through several methods:
*   **Self-filming**: Using a phone to film content is a highly effective approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Hiring content creators**: Engage individuals to film themselves and acquire usage rights from platforms like Billow or Insense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Generative AI (GenAI)**: This is an increasingly popular and trendy option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   Create AI-generated User-Generated Content (UGC) using platforms like TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   Utilize services for creating GenAI avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   Generate AI B-roll footage with tools such as Runway Gen 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

These sourcing methods can significantly reduce overall ad costs by half and improve the Media Efficiency Ratio (MER) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. While testing ads incurs costs, sourcing content also has expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Given the intense competition in the ad feed, finding cost-effective ways to test more ads is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Many marketers struggle with iterating on successful video ads on Meta, often missing out on additional profit despite finding a winning ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>. This is akin to finding gold but instead of digging deeper, moving to a new location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">00:00:08</a>. The [[hook_swapping_technique | hook swapping]] tactic offers a simple yet effective method to create converting video ads 10 times faster and increase revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">00:00:13</a>.

## The Importance of Visual Hooks

To aggressively and shamelessly test more [[visual_hooks_in_video_ads | visual hooks]], marketers need to move beyond testing only three or four variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">00:00:41</a>. It's often unknown whether a marketer has the best [[Importance of hooks in video ads | hook]] for a concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">00:00:49</a>.

TikTok research indicates that 50% of ad recall occurs within the first two seconds, highlighting the short attention spans of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">00:00:54</a>. New [[Importance of hooks in video ads | hooks]] can specifically target new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">00:01:01</a>.

## Hook Swapping in Practice

[[hook_swapping_technique | Hook swapping]] is one of the most effective iteration methods because it builds upon a proven ad concept and winning formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">00:03:45</a>. This tactic is considered low risk, low effort, and high reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">00:03:54</a>.

### Case Study: Simple Intermittent Fasting App

An 8-figure dating app, the Simple Intermittent Fasting App, estimated to be making $47.8 million per year, effectively uses this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">00:01:06</a>. They launched at least 20 ad variations using the same core video, with only 20 different [[visual_hooks_in_video_ads | visual hooks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">00:01:17</a>. These variations were often launched on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">00:01:25</a>.

By studying their ad library, it's evident they apply this method across multiple core body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">00:01:28</a>. Many of their [[visual_hooks_in_video_ads | visual hooks]] are AI-generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">00:01:41</a>. They typically use a single text hook, such as "How to lose 40 lbs in one month," which is suspected to be performing very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">00:01:44</a>. These [[visual_hooks_in_video_ads | visual hooks]] transition into a user-generated content (UGC) testimonial mashup, a technique also favored by apps like N <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">00:02:11</a>.

### Other Examples

This tactic was a favorite on the growth team at Calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">00:01:34</a>. Top mobile apps like Calm, Rise Science, and Headway demonstrate extensive ad launches over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">00:03:30</a>.

### Key Principles for Hook Swapping

*   **Visual Consistency:** Don't overly worry about visual consistency between the [[visual_hooks_in_video_ads | hook]] and the body of the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">00:01:52</a>.
*   **Message Consistency:** Focus more on maintaining message consistency from the [[visual_hooks_in_video_ads | hook]] to the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">00:01:56</a>.
*   **Flooding the Market:** This tactic helps flood the market with "high floor" ads, meaning they are much less likely to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">00:03:09</a>.
*   **Taking More Shots:** Similar to how a basketball player like Steph Curry needs to keep shooting even when in a slump, marketers need to "take more shots on goal" by creating many ad variants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">00:03:17</a>.

### Analogies

Consider the iPhone: Apple found a winning product and continues to iterate on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">00:04:09</a>. Each new iPhone version can be thought of as a creative refresh with new [[Importance of hooks in video ads | hooks]], such as a better camera, more storage, or new colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">00:04:22</a>.

## The Power of Iteration

According to Product Creative Velocity Apps Flyer, 2% of ad variants generate 68% of the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">00:02:54</a>. This means less than one out of 50 ad variants created will scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">00:03:01</a>. Since it's never certain which ad will scale, continuously testing new [[Importance of hooks in video ads | hooks]] on winning concepts is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">00:03:07</a>.

Another tool, Admanage.snap, can make ad uploads faster and easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">00:02:43</a>.

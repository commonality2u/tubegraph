When evaluating ad performance for [[scaling_ad_spend_on_facebook | scaling]], it's crucial to avoid a common pitfall: sorting ads solely by Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. An ad with the lowest CPA might have only spent a minimal amount, such as six dollars, or even zero, which doesn't provide a reliable indicator for [[scaling_ad_spend_on_facebook | larger-scale]] investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Custom Metric: Ad Score

To accurately identify top-performing ads for [[scaling_ad_spend_on_facebook | scaling]], consider creating a custom metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This metric, referred to as "Ad Score" (or "Purchase Score"), helps rank ads more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. While more complex formulas are possible, a simple approach can achieve 90% of the desired result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Formula and Implementation

In Facebook Ads Manager, create a custom metric named "Ad Score" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The formula for this metric is:

> Purchases / Cost Per Purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

### How Ad Score Helps

This formula helps analyze ads by ensuring:
*   Ads with more purchases will have a higher score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Ads with a lower CPA will also have a higher score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   If two ads have the same CPA, the one with more purchases will receive a higher score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

The Ad Score metric simplifies the process of ranking ads against each other, guiding where to allocate limited resources effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

From: [[mansonchen]] <br/> 

Early in their career, the speaker admits to being envious of brand marketers. They viewed [[brand_vs_performance_marketing | performance marketing]] as akin to sports, with a clear "scoreboard" where spending $10 requires a return greater than the cost plus margin, otherwise risking job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. In contrast, brand marketing seemed to operate on subjective feelings, leading to millions of dollars in spending without clear, immediate ROI metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

## Hand-in-Hand Operations

Over time, the speaker realized that [[brand_vs_performance_marketing | brand marketing]] and [[brand_vs_performance_marketing | performance marketing]] work synergistically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. While [[brand_vs_performance_marketing | performance marketers]] focus on attracting the right audience with the right [[creative_diversity_in_ad_strategies | creative]] and measuring ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>, a strong brand significantly eases this task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. Brand, in this context, extends beyond large-scale TV campaigns; it's about building trust in the marketplace with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:46]</a>.

When brand campaigns are active, [[evaluating_ad_performance | performance metrics]] often show improvements, including better conversion rates, increased organic and direct traffic, and more opportunities for retargeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. It is considered "naive" for a [[brand_vs_performance_marketing | performance marketer]] to dismiss brand efforts as a waste of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.

## Limitations in Measurement

[[brand_vs_performance_marketing | Growth marketers]] and [[brand_vs_performance_marketing | performance marketers]] can sometimes be "myopic," limited by attribution windows, cookies, and challenges like ad blockers and iOS privacy changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. For instance, after iOS 14, up to 70% of retargeting pools based on pixels were lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. Much of the impact of brand efforts cannot be directly measured, highlighting the blend of art and science in marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

## Campaign Strategy Approaches

Two primary approaches to campaign structure are discussed:

### Full-Funnel with Defined Objectives
One strategy involves allocating a percentage of the budget to upper-funnel objectives like video views or reach for top-of-funnel awareness, coupled with a bottom-of-funnel retargeting campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. This approach aims for wide reach and eyeballs at a lower CPM, with the performance aspect primarily in the retargeting phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. It's an interesting setup that, in a way, challenges platform algorithms by going broad first and then targeting those who trickle down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

### Broad Targeting with Platform Optimization
The alternative, which is generally preferred by the speaker and aligns with [[facebook_advertisement_strategies | Facebook's guidance]], is to go broad and allow the platform's machine learning and algorithms to handle all targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. This involves using conversion optimization settings and not getting overly complex with retargeting pools due to measurement limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. [[creative_diversity_in_ad_strategies | Creative diversity]] is used to address different stages of awareness within this broad targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

## Evolving Platform Features

[[facebook_advertisement_strategies | Facebook]] (Meta) has been pushing towards using [[adset_budget_optimization_vs_advantage_shopping_campaigns | Advantage+ campaigns]], which often limit specific targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. However, they have introduced features that allow advertisers to specify the percentage of budget for returning customers (e.g., 30% or 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. Additionally, [[facebook_advertisement_strategies | Facebook]] now enables breakdowns in reporting to show spend and ROAS for engaged, returning, and new customers, providing greater visibility into each funnel stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. This indicates [[facebook_advertisement_strategies | Facebook's]] confidence in its ability to drive new customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.

There's also discussion of [[facebook_advertisement_strategies | Facebook]] rolling out an "incremental conversion objective" that optimizes for conversions based on their own data or external analytics, reflecting their confidence in delivering true incrementality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. Google's PMax campaigns also include a toggle for new customers only, showing a similar trend across platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.

## Channel Suitability

Generally, [[facebook_advertisement_strategies | Facebook]] is considered a better channel for top-of-funnel and mid-funnel efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>. Search (Google) is seen as excellent for bottom-funnel demand capture, though Google's PMax can be good for some verticals like e-commerce, it's often considered "hot trash" for B2B lead generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>.

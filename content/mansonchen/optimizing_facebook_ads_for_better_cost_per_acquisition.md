Many advertisers frequently waste money when [[creative testing in Facebook ads | testing Facebook ads]] because they are unaware of the proper setup for [[creative testing for Facebook ads | creative testing campaigns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A key challenge is the Facebook algorithm's "winner-take-all" nature, where one or two ads within an ad set receive the majority of the spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Campaign Type to Avoid for Creative Testing

It is recommended to avoid the **Advantage Shopping Plus (ASC)** campaign type for [[creative testing for Facebook ads | creative testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

*   **Limited Testing Scope** If you upload 50 ads into an ASC campaign, typically only one ad will receive most of the spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Probabilistic Algorithm** The Facebook algorithm is probabilistic and can make mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Skewed Delivery** Early funnel metrics like click-through rate and view duration can significantly skew ad delivery from the start, but these metrics do not always lead to a conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. For example, a clickbaity ad might attract clicks but fail to convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Low Success Rate** With 50 ads in an ad set, there's only approximately a 2% chance that Facebook will pick the "right" ad immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Real-World Example** An adtech app founder using an ASC campaign for [[creative testing in Facebook ads | creative testing]] initially saw cost per trial figures of $40-$50 from the first three ads that received spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. After pausing these, the fourth ad achieved an $8 cost per trial, demonstrating a five to six times better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Recommended Campaign Type for Creative Testing

The recommended campaign type for [[creative testing for Facebook ads | creative testing]] is the **Adset Budget Optimization (ABO) campaign** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

*   **Budget Control** ABO campaigns allow you to choose the daily budget for each ad set within the campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Improved Chances of Success** With an ad set test of four ad variants, an ABO campaign offers a 25% chance that Facebook will select the right one right out of the gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **More Opportunities to Find Winners** This approach leads to more upfront spend but increases the chances of discovering the best-performing ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Objective Pausing** Ads can be quickly and objectively paused using triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Creative Testing Campaign Setup

For [[creative testing for Facebook ads | creative testing]] in an ABO campaign:

*   **Targeting** Test one country and one language, such as the US in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   Once a winning ad is identified, it can be localized for other languages and moved into evergreen campaigns for their respective countries or country groupings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Daily Budget** Start a [[creative testing for Facebook ads | creative testing]] ad set with a daily budget of $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Bidding Strategy** Use auto bidding; do not set a value for cost per result goal or a bid cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Scaling Campaign Setup

An **Advantage Shopping Plus campaign** can be used as the ideal [[scaling Facebook Ads | scaling campaign]] setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

*   **Proven Ads** Ideally, every ad in this ad set should have already proven itself in the [[creative testing for Facebook ads | creative testing campaign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Confident Performance** Since the ads are pre-vetted, it doesn't significantly matter which ad Facebook picks in the [[scaling ad spend on Facebook | scaling campaign]], as there's high confidence it will result in a low Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Fatigue Management** If a winning ad begins to fatigue, it can be paused, allowing another proven ad to gain spend and take its place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

The use of ABO campaigns for [[creative testing for Facebook ads | creative testing]] in conjunction with Advantage Shopping Plus campaigns for [[scaling Facebook Ads | scaling]] offers a structured approach to [[optimizing and scaling Facebook ad campaigns | optimizing and scaling Facebook ad campaigns]] for better CPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

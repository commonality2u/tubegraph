Approximately 90% of your [[broad_targeting_with_meta_ads | Meta ads]] are expected to fail unless an effective iteration strategy is applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To address this, a method has been developed to increase the expected value of every new ad tested, based on experience creating tens of thousands of ads that have profitably spent tens of millions on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This approach is particularly useful for those [[iterative_testing_process_to_find_winning_ads | testing a lot of new ads]] but not achieving significant successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Ad Performance Classification: Traffic Light System

A "traffic light system" is used to categorize the performance of ads being tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>:
*   **Green Ads:** Ads that are meeting their Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Yellow Ads:** Ads performing at approximately 1.25 times the CAC goal, though this can vary based on risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Red Ads:** Ads that are above 1.5 times the CAC goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Iteration Strategy

It typically takes up to three [[iterative_testing_process_to_find_winning_ads | rounds of iteration]] to transform a new ad concept into a winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. When [[iterative_testing_process_to_find_winning_ads | testing new ads]] that aren't initially performing, expect to [[iterating_on_winning_video_ads_on_meta | iterate]] two times to decrease the CAC of the ad concept over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

A recommended approach for [[creative_testing_structure_for_meta_ads | ad testing]] is to start with a 50/50 blend of new concepts and iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This mix balances:
*   **Exploring new concepts:** This prevents burning out existing successful concepts by continuously iterating on them without introducing fresh ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Exploiting winning ads and concepts:** This leverages what is already performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

[[creative_testing_structure_for_meta_ads | Testing a lot of new concepts]] is inherently risky due to the introduction of many new variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Therefore, [[iterating_on_winning_video_ads_on_meta | iterating]] on these concepts and introducing specific ad elements can significantly increase the expected value of each new ad tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## The Importance of Creative Volume

Creative volume is crucial because some ad concepts have a smaller market and fatigue more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Research from Meta indicates that half of all ads will cease to perform within 48 hours, and only 2% last beyond 35 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Interestingly, AppsFlyer found that 2% of ads account for 50% of ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This highlights the necessity of having many "shots on goal" to continuously feed ad campaigns with new, potentially successful creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Creative Dimension Mind Map

To effectively manage and understand various ad elements, a "mind map" of creative dimensions can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This tool helps catalog the qualitative attributes of ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a> and is invaluable for understanding why ads perform as they do over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. By making hypotheses, conducting ad tests, and gathering feedback through data and ad spend, marketers can identify what makes ads scale and replicate those successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

The mind map categorizes creative dimensions into several buckets, similar to the traffic light system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>:
*   Ideas
*   Testing (middle-of-the-road performance)
*   Things that don't work
*   Things that are working (scaling or "unicorn" ads)

Within each bucket, elements are further divided by:
*   Static formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
*   Video formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
*   Scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
*   Visual treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
*   Hooks (visual or text) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
*   Audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>

### Examples of Testable Elements
The mind map includes examples of elements that can be tested to increase ad performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>:

*   **Ad Formats:** Notebook style, note on a wall, video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Scripts:** Problem-agitate-solution, POV text wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Visual Treatments:** Kaleidoscope effect, split frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Video Formats:** Skits, podcast-style video ads, B-roll mashups, testimonial mashups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Audio:** Trending music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Building a Creative Library

Using this mind map, marketers can build a comprehensive library of all tested elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This includes cataloging things that didn't work, things that worked moderately well, and those that worked exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. The goal is to consistently do more of what's working and less of what isn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. By scaling the volume of ads tested while maintaining a high creative win rate, advertisers can avoid wasting budget on ineffective ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

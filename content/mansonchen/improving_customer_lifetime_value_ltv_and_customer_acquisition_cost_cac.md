From: [[mansonchen]] <br/> 

If Meta ads result in negative LTV (Customer Lifetime Value) to CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) ratios and an extended payback period, it may indicate falling into a broad targeting trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article outlines cautions regarding broad targeting with Meta ads and proven tactics to regain control of the Facebook algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The Broad Targeting Approach by Meta

Meta's media buying has become more opaque, with broad targeting now being the recommended audience setting for scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This typically involves country-level targeting, exclusion of past purchasers, and no interest or lookalike targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The strategy is to provide the best possible signal through purchase optimization and Conversion API feeds, supply a large volume of diverse creatives, and allow Meta to identify the appropriate audience based on these creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Meta is increasingly promoting [[adset budget optimization vs advantage shopping campaigns | Advantage Shopping+ campaigns]], which offer a more streamlined and tailored approach compared to manual sales campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. These campaigns often hide specific targeting and bidding settings:
*   [[adset based optimization versus campaign budget optimization | Campaign Budget Optimization]] (CBO) allows Facebook to determine budget allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   Advantage Plus Audience settings conceal audience targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   Advantage Plus Placements hide placement targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Highest Volume bidding conceals bid caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Drawbacks of Broad Targeting and Wrong Optimization Signals

A significant drawback of this approach is when apps are [[optimizing_for_purchases_and_trial_starts | optimizing for the wrong event]], such as trials, installs, or registrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. While this can reach incremental audiences if current purchase-optimized setups face diminishing returns, it is exceptionally challenging to execute correctly and should only be attempted with a competent data science team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Meta will optimize for the lowest cost per trial or purchase, but it lacks understanding of audience quality or LTV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This can lead to:
*   Declining trial-to-subscribe rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   Refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48">[02:48]</a>
*   No activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49">[02:49]</a>
*   Increased customer support tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50">[02:50]</a>

> [!CAUTION]
> If the optimization signal is not highly correlated with your business objective, you are instructing Meta to find the wrong audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54">[02:54]</a>. It's akin to asking for more sheep when you specifically need blue sheep from the Himalayas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59">[02:59]</a>.
>
> A personal experience involved people signing up for a free trial with fake or prepaid credit cards, leading to failed charges after the trial ended, no activation, and high cancellation/refund rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07">[03:07]</a>. This highlighted a failure to guide Facebook towards the ideal customer profile (ICP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29">[03:29]</a>.

## Tactics to Take Back Control of the Algorithm

To effectively manage the algorithm and tell Facebook precisely who to target, consider these strategies:

### 1. Creatives for Your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
Develop [[role_of_creative_velocity_and_ad_variations_in_mobile_user_acquisition | creatives]] specifically tailored to your ICP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59">[03:59]</a>. For example, older demographics often engage more with Facebook feed content, while younger audiences are typically found on Instagram Reels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03">[04:03]</a>.

### 2. Qualified Trial Event Optimization
Send a "qualified trial" event to Meta, and [[optimizing_for_purchases_and_trial_starts | optimize for that event]] in the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10">[04:10]</a>. This qualified trial could be an activation metric that occurs within 24 to 48 hours post-sign-up, such as an asset uploaded, project created, or asset generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16">[04:16]</a>. The key is to identify what is highly correlated to your subscribe event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29">[04:29]</a>.

### 3. Bid Multipliers
If you have a Facebook representative, inquire about getting whitelisted for bid multipliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46">[04:46]</a>. This feature significantly increased trial-to-subscribe rates by 20-30% on Android campaigns for Comm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57">[04:57]</a>.

### 4. Adding Friction or Disqualification in the Sign-up Flow
Implement steps in the sign-up process to filter out unqualified leads:
*   Reduce free trial duration (e.g., from 14 to 7 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11">[05:11]</a>.
*   Require confirmation of a business email address for sign-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17">[05:17]</a>.
*   Consider adding a minimum spend threshold for booking meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25">[05:25]</a>.

### 5. Eliminating the Free Trial
Removing the free trial entirely aligns the Meta algorithm most closely with your ultimate business objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31">[05:31]</a>. To mitigate risk for prospects, offer a money-back guarantee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40">[05:40]</a>. This could involve shifting to a demo-based onboarding flow or a hard paywall where users must pay to use the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46">[05:46]</a>.

#### Opal App Example
The Opal app initially did not offer a free trial, instead implementing an early paywall for a relatively expensive subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04">[06:04]</a>. They found this approach effective for using the subscription as a discovery and product-market fit engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16">[06:16]</a>, focusing on a Day 8 return on ad event as a key metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27">[06:27]</a>.

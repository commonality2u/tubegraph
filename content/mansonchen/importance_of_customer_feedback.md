[[validating_a_product_with_customer_feedback | Customer feedback]] is crucial for product development and achieving revenue. For one founder, generating $100 a month in revenue for a food strap company required approximately 32 feedback sessions and two product pivots over three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While expenses for the tool were around $132 a month, indicating the company was still in the red, the willingness of people to pay for the tool and perceive its value was a positive outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

A key learning from this experience was the importance of creating something valuable rather than just something "cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The initial version of their product, an AI video platform designed to make AI videos for anyone regardless of assets, was considered "cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. However, the subsequent pivots driven by customer feedback led to a product that customers were willing to pay for.

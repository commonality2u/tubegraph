To effectively scale on Meta, a high volume of creative content is essential due to competition from paid and organic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>. The most profitable way to scale involves lowering the cost per new ad creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">00:00:13</a>. Many businesses waste significant time and money on video ad creation if they do not adopt the [[modular_approach_in_video_advertising | modular approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">00:00:21</a>.

## The Modular Approach Explained

The [[modular_approach_in_video_advertising | modular approach]] conceptualizes video ads as "building blocks" or "Lego pieces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">00:00:27</a>. A typical video ad structure consists of three main components:
*   **Hook**: The opening segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">00:00:33</a>.
*   **Body Video**: The main content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">00:00:35</a>.
*   **Call to Action (CTA)**: The concluding segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">00:00:35</a>.

These video blocks can be continuously reused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">00:00:37</a>.

### Measuring Module Effectiveness

The effectiveness of these reusable video blocks can be measured using "soft metrics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">00:00:40</a>:

*   **Hook Rate**: A custom metric in Facebook defined as 3-second video views divided by impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">00:00:45</a>.
    *   If the hook rate is below 30%, test swapping out the hook while keeping everything else constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">00:00:54</a>.
*   **Hold Rate**: A through-play or 15-second video view divided by impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">00:01:00</a>.
    *   If the hold rate is below 10%, test swapping out the body while keeping everything else constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">00:01:05</a>.
*   **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**:
    *   If the click-through rate is below 1%, test swapping out the call to action while keeping everything else constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">00:01:12</a>.

### Creating New Ads from Modules

New video ads can be created by simply switching up the video timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">00:01:21</a>. For example:
*   Hooks can start with a visual metaphor of a problem, an unboxing clip, or something "oddly satisfying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">00:01:35</a>.
*   Bodies can begin with an unboxing video, transition into benefits, then a product demo, and finally results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">00:01:46</a>.
*   Clips can be mixed and matched; there's no need to create content from scratch each time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">00:02:07</a>. This allows for improvement over time based on data regarding what is or isn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">00:02:13</a>.

## Sourcing Creative Assets

Your role is to compile these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">00:02:22</a>. Assets for modules can be sourced in several ways:
*   **Self-Filming**: Using a phone to film content often yields great results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">00:02:24</a>.
*   **Hiring Creators**: Pay individuals to film themselves and acquire usage rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">00:02:29</a>. Platforms like Billow or Insense can facilitate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">00:02:31</a>.
*   **Generative AI (GenAI)**: This is an increasingly popular method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">00:02:37</a>.
    *   Create AI-generated UGC (User-Generated Content) using platforms like TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">00:02:44</a>.
    *   Utilize services for creating GenAI avatars or even GenAI B-roll with tools like Runway Gen 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">00:02:50</a>.

## Benefits of the Modular Approach

Adopting the [[modular_creative_strategy_for_video_ads | modular creative strategy for video ads]] can drastically reduce ad creative costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">00:02:18</a>. It can slash overall ad costs in half and improve your Media Efficiency Ratio (MER) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">00:02:58</a>.

While testing ads and sourcing content incurs costs, the current advertising landscape necessitates finding ways to test more ads without excessive spending, given the competition from paid and organic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">00:03:09</a>. A study by AppsFlyer revealed that less than 2% of ads account for over 68% of ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">00:03:28</a>. Creative strategists are often wrong more than right, so the goal is to create more "shots on goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">00:03:39</a>. A repeatable and [[costeffective_strategies_for_video_ad_content_creation | cost-effective process]] is crucial for finding winning ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">00:03:46</a>.

To effectively scale on Meta platforms, a high volume of creative content is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This is due to intense competition from both paid and organic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Achieving profitable scaling on Meta involves reducing the cost per new ad creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Advertisers are often wasting time and money if they do not adopt a modular approach for video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Modular Approach to Video Ad Creation

Think of video ads as building blocks or Lego pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Typically, video ads consist of a hook, a body video, and a call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The benefit of this approach is that these individual video blocks can be reused and their effectiveness measured using "soft metrics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This strategy significantly cuts down on ad creative costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Key Metrics for [[Testing and Iteration for Successful Ads | Testing Ad Components]]

*   **Hook Rate:** This is a custom metric in Facebook, calculated as a 3-second video view divided by impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. If the hook rate falls below 30%, it's recommended to [[importance of testing hooks for video ads | test swapping out the hook]] while keeping other components the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Hold Rate:** Defined as a "through play" or 15-second video view divided by impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. If this rate is below 10%, the body of the ad should be swapped and tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** If the overall CTR of the ad is below 1%, the call to action should be swapped and tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

By analyzing these metrics, advertisers can iteratively improve their ads based on data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Building New Ads from Existing Modules

The modular approach allows for the creation of net new video ads simply by re-arranging existing video timeline components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

For example:
*   **Hooks** can start with a visual metaphor of a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, an unboxing clip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, or something oddly satisfying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Bodies** can begin with an unboxing video, transition into benefits, move to a product demo, and conclude with results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

This means you don't have to create every ad from scratch, enabling you to mix and match clips to find winning combinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Sourcing Creative Assets for Testing

To support a high-volume [[creative_testing_in_facebook_ads | creative testing]] strategy, you need a continuous supply of assets. Options include:
*   **Self-Filming:** Using a phone to film assets can yield great results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Hiring Creators:** Contract individuals to film content and obtain usage rights. Services like Billow or Incense can facilitate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Generative AI (GenAI):** This is an increasingly popular and trendy method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. You can create AI-generated user-generated content (UGC) using platforms like TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, or utilize services for generative avatars and b-roll (e.g., Runway Gen 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Using these methods can significantly reduce overall ad costs, potentially by half, and improve your Media Efficiency Ratio (MER) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Why [[Testing and Iteration for Successful Ads | Testing and Iteration]] is Crucial

Ad [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | testing]] incurs costs, as does sourcing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. However, advertising is a numbers game, and you need to find ways to [[testing_strategies_for_video_ad_components | test more ads]] without overspending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, especially given the intense competition in the feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

A study by AppsFlyer revealed that less than 2% of ads account for over 68% of ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. As creative strategists, it's acknowledged that "we are wrong more often than right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Therefore, the goal is to create "more shots on goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a> and implement a repeatable, cost-effective process for finding [[iterative_testing_process_to_find_winning_ads | winning ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

Recent studies from AppsFlyer and [[creative_testing_strategies_for_meta_in_2024|Meta]] provide valuable insights into effective [[creative_testing_strategies_for_meta_in_2024|creative testing]] strategies for 2024, emphasizing the importance of volume and diversity in ad creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## AppsFlyer Study Findings

A recent study by AppsFlyer revealed that a disproportionately small number of ad variants account for the majority of ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.
From their study, it was found that one out of 50 variants garners 68% of ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This figure already excludes video ads or ads with less than $50 in spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. In reality, even fewer than one in 50 variants achieve 68% of spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This finding bolsters the need to test more ads to find the high-performing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Meta Study Findings

An older [[creative_testing_strategies_for_meta_in_2024|Meta]] study previously indicated that the fastest-growing advertisers tested 11 times more creative per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. While correlation is not causation, the newer AppsFlyer study reinforces this point, highlighting the necessity of testing more ads than one might initially consider to uncover effective creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Key Recommendations for Creative Testing in 2024

Based on these insights, the following approaches are recommended for [[creative_strategy_and_testing_for_meta_ads|creative testing]] on platforms like [[creative_testing_strategies_for_meta_in_2024|Meta]] and TikTok:

*   **High Volume and Quality**
    *   Aim to produce as many ads as possible while maintaining a high standard of quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Avoid simply creating a large number of low-quality ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Ad Naming Convention**
    *   Implement a clear ad naming convention to effectively track and analyze every ad being tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This makes it easier to review performance and identify working creatives over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Creative Diversity**
    *   Utilize a diverse set of creatives, ensuring they do not all look, sound, or convey the same message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This includes testing various ad types such as:
        *   Static ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
        *   Video ads, including user-generated content (UGC), 3D motion, and AI-generated visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
        *   "Ugly ads" or Post-it ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
        *   Product-focused ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
    *   The goal is to achieve extensive "creative diversity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### The Principle of Volume

Echoing Alex Hormozi's perspective, "volume negates luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This philosophy is highly applicable to [[creative_testing_strategies_for_meta_in_2024|creative testing]] on platforms like [[creative_testing_strategies_for_meta_in_2024|Meta]] and TikTok, where a high volume of diverse tests can lead to discovering winning creative strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

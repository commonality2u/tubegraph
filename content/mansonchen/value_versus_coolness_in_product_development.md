A significant learning in product development emphasizes creating something valuable over something merely cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40"></a>. This insight comes from a founder who has been developing a product for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01"></a>.

## Initial Product Development Journey

The founder secured their first two customers in the last week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11"></a>. This milestone was reached after 32 feedback sessions and two significant pivots in the product's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13"></a>. Currently, the product generates $100 per month in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21"></a>. With monthly expenses for tools at $132 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26"></a>, the venture is still operating at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31"></a>. Despite this, the founder is pleased that customers are willing to pay for the tool and recognize its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35"></a>.

## The Shift: From Cool to Valuable

The initial version of the product, named "Sovereign," was an AI video platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48"></a>. It was designed to create AI videos for anyone, even those without existing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55"></a>. This first iteration was perceived as "cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57"></a>. However, the subsequent pivots and feedback sessions led to the realization that value, rather than just coolness, is paramount for product success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42"></a>.

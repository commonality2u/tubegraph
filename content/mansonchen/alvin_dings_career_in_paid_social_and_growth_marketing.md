Alvin Ding is an experienced professional in paid social and growth marketing, having worked at major companies like Upwork and Airbnb before founding his own agency, Ads by Alvin. His career spans over a decade in paid marketing, with a significant focus on paid social since 2015. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>

## Early Career and Entry into Paid Social
Alvin started in paid search, focusing on Google, before quickly transitioning to paid social at Upwork. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> He joined Upwork when it was still the merged entity of Elance and ODesk. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> His role there involved client acquisition, helping people find freelancers by posting jobs on the platform. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> As the company grew and aimed for more top-of-funnel reach, he began delving into Facebook advertising, which he found to be effective for [[scaling_facebook_ads | scaling]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>

He notes that the landscape of [[facebook_advertisement_strategies | Facebook advertisement strategies]] has changed significantly, recalling a past rule that restricted text to no more than 20% of an ad image, a rule that made the [[creative_team_strategies_for_facebook_ads | creative process]] more challenging for designers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>

At Airbnb, Alvin was part of the host acquisition team, managing global paid search for hosts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> His time there was cut short in May 2020 due to layoffs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, as the travel company's bookings plummeted. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>

## Founding Ads by Alvin
The layoff from Airbnb served as a catalyst for Alvin to start his own agency, Ads by Alvin, in May 2020. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a> He describes this transition as both "a gift and a curse," noting that in large corporations like Airbnb, he often felt a ceiling on his growth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> Starting his agency involved initial months of building his reputation and acquiring clients, a journey he describes as a "long four years." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

## Philosophy on Brand vs. Performance Marketing
As a performance marketer, Alvin initially felt "jealous" of brand marketers due to the clear, scoreboard-like metrics in performance marketing (ROI on ad spend). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a> However, he realized that brand and performance marketing work hand-in-hand. Performance marketing focuses on targeting the right audience with the right creative for conversions, while a strong brand presence in the marketplace, built on trust, makes conversions much easier. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>

He observes that brand campaigns often lead to:
*   Better conversion rates in performance metrics. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
*   Increased organic and direct traffic. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>
*   More users available for retargeting. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>

Alvin believes it's "naive" for performance marketers to discount brand as a waste of money. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a> He acknowledges that growth marketers can be myopic due to limitations like attribution windows and cookies, and that much of the impact of brand cannot be easily measured, describing it as "both an art and an attribution problem." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>

## Current Practices and Insights
Alvin discusses various [[facebook_advertisement_strategies | Facebook advertisement strategies]] and [[improving_ad_performance_with_datadriven_strategies | data-driven strategies]]:

*   **Full-Funnel Approach:** He discusses the common strategy of allocating budget to upper-funnel (video view/reach) and lower-funnel (retargeting) campaigns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a> While this approach can achieve wide reach, he prefers allowing Facebook's algorithms to handle targeting by focusing on creative diversity across different stages of awareness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>
*   **Trusting Facebook's Optimization:** He notes that Facebook's guidance encourages trusting their machine learning for targeting and using conversion optimization settings rather than manual, granular retargeting. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
*   **Impact of iOS 14 and Ad Blockers:** The iOS 14 privacy changes significantly impacted retargeting pools based on pixels, leading to a loss of about 70% of these audiences. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>
*   **Advantage+ Campaigns:** Facebook is increasingly pushing advertisers towards Advantage+ campaigns, which limit specific targeting, often focusing on new customers or a mix of new and old. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>
*   **New Reporting Features:** Facebook has improved visibility by allowing advertisers to define previous and engaged customers and use these as breakdowns in reporting. This helps evaluate Facebook's effectiveness as a channel, especially in driving new customers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>

Alvin believes that Facebook is a better channel for top-of-funnel and mid-funnel efforts compared to search, which is primarily for bottom-of-funnel demand capture. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>

### B2B Lead Generation Strategies
For B2B SaaS platforms, Alvin recommends:
*   **Free Trials:** Offering a free trial is highly effective due to low associated costs and minimal friction for user sign-up, providing an opportunity for users to experience the product and potentially become sticky. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>
*   **Search (Google Ads):** Standard search is excellent for B2B due to its high intent, allowing targeting of specific features people are looking for. However, it comes with very high Cost Per Clicks (CPCs) due to high LTVs (Lifetime Value) and competition. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>
*   **LinkedIn:** Paid LinkedIn campaigns can provide significant reach, especially for lead generation through tutorials or lead magnets (e.g., ebooks). Like search, LinkedIn also has very high CPMs/CPCs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>
*   **Content Partnerships:** Partnering with or guest posting for individual Substack writers or other content creators can be a valuable strategy, akin to influencer marketing or UGC (User-Generated Content) in the B2B space. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>

## Utilizing AI Tools for Marketing and Content Creation
Alvin extensively uses [[utilizing_ai_tools_for_marketing_and_content_creation | AI tools for marketing and content creation]], particularly "Hunch," in his workflows. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>
He employs Hunch for:
*   **ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) Research:** The tool automatically scrapes data from various sources based on a URL, providing insights into needs, wants, desires, keyword targets, ad copy, hooks, and angles. This process, which would typically take a human much longer, is completed in minutes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>
*   **YouTube Content Creation:** He applies similar AI tools for generating YouTube scripts and titles, acknowledging that while AI is limited, it's excellent for getting 60% of the way there and providing a strong starting point. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>

He foresees a future where AI tools will become increasingly adept at processing various formats and modalities, labeling content at speeds humans cannot match. This will be a significant boon for content creators, especially for sourcing and organizing footage for videos. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a> The [[the_impact_of_ai_on_marketing | impact of AI on marketing]] is evident in its ability to streamline tasks like identifying specific clips within long videos, which can save editors substantial time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>

## YouTube Channel and Media Company Aspirations
Alvin maintains a faceless YouTube channel, which he describes as one of his most challenging endeavors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a> His goal for the channel is to evolve into a full-time media company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>

### YouTube Metrics and Challenges
In growth marketing, the Northstar metric is ROAS (Return on Ad Spend), or more specifically, contribution margin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a> For YouTube, Alvin considers "view duration per impression" as the key metric, akin to revenue per impression in paid advertising. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a> This metric combines the cost (impressions) with the signal of interest (seconds watched) and includes the click-through rate of the thumbnail. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>

His main bottleneck is the thumbnail's CTR (Click-Through Rate); he aims for 10% but currently lags at 3-4%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a> This highlights the psychological challenge of creating a "curiosity gap" to make viewers stop scrolling, click, and then watch the video without bouncing early. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a> These challenges have parallels with [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | using visual hooks and iterations in ad campaigns]] for paid video ads, where metrics like hook rate, average view duration, and hold rate are crucial for performance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>

### Aspirations
Alvin's broader aspiration to become a media company stems from his love for learning, storytelling, and sharing knowledge. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a> He aims to transition away from client services as a long-term career, focusing instead on the rewarding and naturally interesting aspects of storytelling and knowledge dissemination. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>

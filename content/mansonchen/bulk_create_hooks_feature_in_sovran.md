From: [[mansonchen]] <br/> 

The "bulk create hooks" feature in [[massive_updates_to_sovran_platform | Sovran]] allows users to efficiently generate multiple hook variations by combining visual elements with different text overlays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This functionality is designed to help users create new hooks for testing with existing body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## How it Works

The process involves two main components: visual hooks and text hook variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Visual Hooks

Users can select from existing visual hooks within [[massive_updates_to_sovran_platform | Sovran]] or upload their own filmed visual hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Examples provided include visuals with "latte art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> and a "female" subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Multiple visual hooks can be selected for combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Text Hook Variations

Users can add their own text hooks, such as "POV" or "text hook one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Customization options for text hooks include:
*   Choosing the font <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   Updating the size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   Uploading custom fonts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   Adding multiple text hook versions and positioning them differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Additionally, users can choose the final export ratio, highlight safe areas, and preview the hooks for platforms like Instagram Stories or TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Combination Logic

The feature automatically generates new hooks by combining all selected visual hooks with all entered text hook variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. For example, selecting three visual hooks and two text hooks will create six distinct new hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Once the desired combinations are set, users can initiate the creation process and choose which project to upload the new hooks into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

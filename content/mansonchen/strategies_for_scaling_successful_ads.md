Successfully [[Scaling Facebook Ads | scaling]] ad campaigns on platforms like Meta requires strategic iteration and a deep understanding of ad performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Over 90% of Meta ads may fail without a structured approach to testing and iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A proven method involves identifying how to increase the expected value of every new ad tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Ad Performance Traffic Light System

To effectively manage and iterate on ads, it's beneficial to categorize them using a traffic light system based on their performance relative to the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>:

*   **Green Ads**: These ads are meeting the target CAC goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Yellow Ads**: These ads have a CAC that is approximately 1.25 times the target goal. This threshold can be adjusted based on an advertiser's risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Red Ads**: These ads perform above 1.5 times the target CAC goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Iteration and Testing Strategies

It often takes up to three rounds of iteration to transform a new ad concept into a successful one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Advertisers can typically expect to iterate on an ad concept at least twice to reduce its CAC over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Balancing New Concepts and Iterations
A balanced approach to ad testing involves a 50/50 blend of exploring new ad concepts and iterating on existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This mix helps to:
*   Explore new ideas without risking burnout of successful concepts from excessive iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Mitigate the inherent risks associated with testing many new variables by iterating on existing, partially successful concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   Introduce ad elements that increase the expected value of each new ad tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Importance of Creative Volume

A high volume of creative is essential for [[High volume of creative for scaling Facebook ads | scaling Facebook ads]] because some ad concepts target smaller markets and experience fatigue more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
Research from Meta indicates that:
*   Half of all ads become ineffective within 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   Only 2% of ads remain active beyond 35 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   AppsFlyer research reveals that 2% of ads account for 50% of ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

This data underscores the necessity of having "a lot of shots on goal" to consistently supply the ad platform with fresh, effective content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Creative Dimensions Mind Map

A mind map of creative dimensions can help organize and understand the various elements that contribute to an ad's success, whether for static or video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This tool allows for cataloging the qualitative attributes of ads and supports hypothesis testing by providing data and feedback on ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The ultimate goal is to understand why ads are [[Scaling ad spend on Facebook | scaling]] to enable the creation of more successful campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

The mind map categorizes ads into:
*   **Ideas** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>
*   **Testing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>
*   **Not Working** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>
*   **Working (Yellow and Green)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
*   **Scaling (Unicorn Ads)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>

Within each category, specific ad elements are broken down, such as <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>:
*   Static formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
*   Video formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
*   Scripts (e.g., problem-agitate-solution, POV text wall) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
*   Visual treatments (e.g., kaleidoscope effect, split frame) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>
*   Hooks (visual or text) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>
*   Audio (e.g., trending music) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>

### Building an Ad Library
By maintaining a library of tested elements—categorizing what has worked well, what hasn't, and what's in progress—advertisers can continually refine their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This systematic approach ensures that as the volume of ads being tested increases, the creative win rate remains high, preventing wasted ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## How to Substitute Ad Formats
If an ad is performing well, you can convert it into a variety of other ad formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:17">[01:59:17]</a>.

Key substitutions include:
*   Converting a winning static ad into a video ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:56">[02:06:56]</a>.
*   Transforming a successful video ad into a static ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:04">[02:10:04]</a>.
*   Developing new carousel ads from winning static ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:06">[02:13:06]</a>.

## Retaining the Winning Trait
When substituting ad formats, it is crucial to keep the ad's winning trait intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:36">[02:22:36]</a>. This winning trait could be:
*   The creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:08">[02:27:08]</a>
*   The script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:16">[02:28:16]</a>
*   The imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:21">[02:29:21]</a>
*   The editing style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:45">[02:30:45]</a>

By maintaining these core elements, advertisers can ensure that the new format retains the appeal of the original successful ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:07">[02:03:07]</a>.

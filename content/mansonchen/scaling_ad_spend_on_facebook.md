Advertisers often face the challenge of their best-performing Facebook ads becoming less effective over time, leading to an increase in Cost Per Acquisition (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This decline in performance can occur quickly, with Facebook research indicating a 60% drop in conversion rate after only four repeated exposures to an ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. To combat this and enable [[scaling_facebook_ads_beyond_100000_per_month | scaling to over $10,000 a day in profitable ad spend]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, it's crucial to continuously refresh winning ad creatives.

Manson, founder of Sovereign.ai and former growth and creative strategist at Unicorn BTOC apps like Comm and Cash App, shares three key techniques for refreshing ads to achieve significant [[scaling_facebook_ads | Facebook ad spend scaling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>:

## 1. Hook Swapping

Once a successful combination of a hook, body, call to action (CTA), and music has been identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, the most effective strategy is to introduce new hooks while retaining the proven body and CTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

This method allows advertisers to:
*   **Target New Audiences**: The hook serves as the initial "targeting" mechanism, attracting new incremental audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Maximize Ad Concept Potential**: It enables extracting every last bit of value from a high-performing ad concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Examples and Best Practices
*   The "Simple Intermittent Fasting app" successfully used this technique by testing 16 different visual hooks that all led into the same UGC testimonial ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   [[high_volume_of_creative_for_scaling_facebook_ads | Volume is crucial]] for success, as 50% of ads do not last more than two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Meta also advocates for modular creative at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   Tools like Sovereign.ai can automate the creation of these hook, body, and CTA combinations by allowing users to upload assets and automate naming conventions for easy testing and [[optimizing_and_scaling_facebook_ad_campaigns | scaling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## 2. Substitute

This technique involves transforming a winning ad into a different format while preserving its core effective elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Examples include:
*   Converting a winning static ad into a video ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   Transforming a winning video ad into a static image ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Turning static images into a new carousel ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

The key is to keep the "winning trait" intact, whether it's the creator, the script, the imagery, or the editing style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. These variations help increase ad volume and refresh creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## 3. Combination

This method involves merging elements from two or three existing winning ads to create an entirely new ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This approach is likened to alloying in chemistry, where combining two metals creates a stronger one, such as combining tin and copper to create bronze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Case Study Example
Manson consulted for a men's mental health app that observed two distinct elements performing exceptionally well:
*   Imagery featuring sharks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Ad angles that adopted a skeptical point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

By combining these, they created an ad that became their top performer for months: a heavy text overlay ad with a skeptical message superimposed over a shark image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Conclusion

To effectively refresh and [[optimizing_and_scaling_facebook_ad_campaigns | scale Facebook ad campaigns]], advertisers should apply these three techniques – Hook Swapping, Substitute, and Combination – to their top 25% of ads that exhibit the lowest Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) and high spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Creating batches of these new iterations weekly can significantly improve ad performance and enable sustained [[scaling_facebook_ads | scaling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

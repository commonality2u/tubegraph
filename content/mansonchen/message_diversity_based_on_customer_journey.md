While many discussions focus on [[creative_diversity_in_ad_strategies | creative diversity]] in visual concepts for static and video ads, it is equally important to consider message diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Effective advertising blends visual and message formats to find the most successful combinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Stages of Customer Awareness

Understanding the stages of customer awareness is crucial for diversifying messages based on the buyer journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>:

*   **Unaware**: Individuals who are not aware of the problem or the existence of your solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Problem Aware**: People who recognize they have a problem but are not yet aware of potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Solution Aware**: Customers who know about solutions but are not familiar with your specific product or similar offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Product Aware**: Individuals who are aware of your product and competitor products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Most Aware**: Those who are aware of your product but have not yet made a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

This progression represents the funnel from top to bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For new ventures, it's recommended to begin with bottom-of-funnel messaging, such as customer testimonials, social proof, results, and case studies, and then work up the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This approach allows for message diversification tailored to each part of the buyer journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Universal Human Motivators in Copywriting

To refine messaging, consider universal human motivators that can help brainstorm different angles for ideal customer profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>:

*   Avoiding effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   Saving time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   Avoiding mental or physical pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Increasing comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   Improving health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
*   Improving status or luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   Feeling love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>
*   Being praised and appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>

Reflecting on how your product addresses these motivators can generate numerous message ideas for [[testing_variations_of_messaging_and_formats | testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Messaging Frameworks

Various messaging frameworks can be applied to generate an extensive range of creative concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>:

*   **Listicles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
*   **Problem-Agitate-Solution (PAS) scripts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>
*   **Features-Advantages-Benefit (FAB)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>
*   **Benefit-Before-After-Bridge (BBAB)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
*   **Educational ("Did you know the stat...")** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
*   **Unique Mechanism** (highlighting what's unique to your product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
*   **Founder Story Ads**: Authentic ads where the founder discusses the origin and uniqueness of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Customer Testimonials**: Including testimonial mashups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

These frameworks contribute to robust [[creative_diversity_in_advertising | message diversity]] in advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Where to Start with Message Diversity

To begin, analyze competitors' top concepts and messages to draw inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Pay attention to comments on your own ads and competitor ads for insights into universal human motivators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Understanding the demographics of your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) can also guide ad placement (e.g., older demographics on Facebook feed vs. Instagram Reels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. If competitors' top concepts are image ads, it may be beneficial to explore static ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Ultimately, a healthy [[importance_of_creative_diversity | creative mix]] is desired, encompassing a balance of image ads, video ads, varied messages, pain points, and script frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This strategic approach to [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative diversity]] is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

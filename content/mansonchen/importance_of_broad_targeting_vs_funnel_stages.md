Many brands and agencies make five common mistakes in Facebook ad accounts, particularly concerning the over-reliance on traditional funnel stages versus the strategic application of broad targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Critiquing Funnel-Based Ad Strategies

The traditional approach of segmenting ad campaigns into [[stages_of_awareness_in_marketing | top of funnel]], middle of funnel, and bottom of funnel is not always the most effective strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

### Automatic Optimization by Facebook

Facebook's algorithms are designed to automatically identify users most likely to convert, even with [[broad_targeting_with_meta_ads | broad targeting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Additionally, Facebook can automatically retarget users who have visited a landing page or viewed a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Concerns with Retargeting Performance Claims

While retargeting ad sets often show low Cost Per Acquisition (CPA), this performance can be misleading without proper incrementality testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Without such testing, it is difficult to determine how many conversions would have occurred naturally without the retargeting efforts, potentially leading to wasted ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Therefore, a strong preference is held against a strict bottom-of-funnel approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Insufficient Ad Set Budgets

Another common mistake is setting daily ad set budgets as low as $10 when the Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) goal is $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This constrains the ad set's ability to gather sufficient data and volume, hindering Facebook's learning phase and overall performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Ad sets require as much data as possible to optimize effectively, with Facebook guiding towards about 10 conversion events per week for optimal learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## The Shift to Creative-Centric Targeting

In 2024, creative content has become the primary driver of targeting effectiveness on platforms like Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Prioritizing Creative Testing Over Audience Testing

Instead of continually testing different audiences (e.g., lookalike audiences, interest stacks) with the same creative, the focus should be on [[principles_of_creative_testing_campaigns | creative testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Testing the same creative across various audiences can lead to cannibalization of efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. New creatives must be consistently tested, ideally monthly or even weekly for high-spending accounts, to combat ad fatigue and enable continuous growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Embracing Broad Targeting with Creative Focus

Starting with or moving towards [[broad_targeting_with_meta_ads | broad targeting]] is recommended, especially as accounts [[strategies_for_scaling_successful_ads | scale]] and spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. While interest targeting or lookalike targeting might be considered when starting, the ultimate goal should be to unlock the full potential of broad targeting by leveraging strong creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Ensuring Optimization Events Are Firing

A fundamental step is to verify that optimization events (e.g., purchase events) are correctly firing on the landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Failing to confirm this can result in burning ad spend without proper attribution or optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Sovereign has demonstrated significant success in [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] for mobile gaming companies, particularly in [[boosting_creative_testing_efficiency_in_mobile_gaming_industry | boosting creative testing efficiency]] for their largest user acquisition (UA) channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This impact is highlighted by a case study involving Rewardify, a real cash rewards gaming company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Rewardify's Challenge

Rewardify, a company with over a million satisfied players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, faced a challenge in its [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] process. Dan, the Head of Mobile User Acquisition at Rewardify, recognized the necessity of creating more video ads and variations to acquire users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Their primary and most reliable channel is AppLovin, which demands high "creative velocity" and a large number of ad variations for its algorithm to optimize performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. This requirement is similar to other major ad platforms like Meta and TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

Despite the known need for more creatives, Dan's team, which includes an art director, a playable ads designer, and a video artist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, struggled with the manual and tedious process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. Responsibilities such as leadership decisions and the time-consuming nature of manually pairing top hooks with top body videos in tools like CapCut, along with dealing with naming conventions and creating variations, consumed too much time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## Sovereign's Solution

[[using_sovereignai_for_automating_creative_testing | Sovereign]] provided a solution by automating key aspects of the ad creation and [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. With [[using_sovereignai_for_automating_creative_testing | Sovereign]], Dan could:
*   Upload hooks and main body videos separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
*   Have [[using_sovereignai_for_automating_creative_testing | Sovereign]] automatically combine them to generate new ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   Export ads in all standard sizes suitable for AppLovin, including 9x16, 1x1, 4x5, and 16x9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   Automatically name the exported files following custom naming conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

## Results and Impact

By implementing [[using_sovereignai_for_automating_creative_testing | Sovereign]], Rewardify achieved significant improvements:
*   They were able to [[boosting_creative_testing_efficiency_in_mobile_gaming_industry | boost creative testing]] on their largest UA channel (AppLovin) by 170% month over month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   This surge reflects a strategic shift towards more aggressive testing and iteration of top-performing ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
*   By exploring new combinations of hooks and body videos, they discovered new top-scaling ads and identified themes that might not have been tested otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   Dan could produce a greater volume of video ads in less time, freeing him to focus on other crucial aspects of his job, such as product strategy and company growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

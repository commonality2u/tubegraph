Creative velocity and a high volume of ad variations are critical for successful mobile user acquisition (UA), particularly for gaming companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This approach is highly effective on major ad platforms like AppLovin, Meta, and TikTok, where algorithms benefit from a diverse pool of creatives to identify top-performing ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Rewardify's Challenge with Creative Production

Rewardify, a real-cash rewards gaming company with over a million players, faced a significant challenge in [[boosting_creative_testing_efficiency_in_mobile_gaming_industry | boosting creative testing efficiency in mobile gaming industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Dan, the Head of Mobile User Acquisition at Rewardify, was responsible for acquiring users, especially through creating video ads and their variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

AppLovin is their primary UA channel due to its reliability and lack of policy issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Dan recognized the necessity of creating more video ads and increasing their output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. However, this was difficult to prioritize alongside leadership responsibilities and other tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

The process of manually creating video ad variations was tedious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This involved:
*   Opening CapCut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   Manually pairing top hooks with top body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   [[challenges_in_creating_video_ad_variations_manually | Creating variations manually]] and dealing with naming conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Sovereign's Solution for Ad Variation Creation

Sovereign provided a solution to automate and streamline the creation of ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. With Sovereign, Dan could:
*   Upload hooks and main body videos separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   Allow Sovereign to automatically combine them into new ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   Export ads in all standard sizes (9x16, 1x1, 4x5, 16x9), ideal for platforms like AppLovin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   Automatically name files according to custom naming conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Impact and Results: Boosting Creative Testing

By leveraging Sovereign, Rewardify experienced significant improvements in their ad performance efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>:
*   **Increased Creative Testing:** Dan and his team boosted creative testing on AppLovin, their largest UA channel, by 170% month over month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This surge indicated a strategic shift towards more aggressive [[testing_and_optimizing_ad_variations | testing and optimizing ad variations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Discovery of New Top-Scaling Ads:** By exploring new combinations of hooks and body videos, they not only discovered new top-scaling ads but also identified themes that might not have been tested otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This aided in [[improving_ad_performance_with_datadriven_strategies | improving ad performance with datadriven strategies]].
*   **Time Savings and Strategic Focus:** The ability to produce many more video ads in less time freed Dan to concentrate on other critical aspects of his job, such as product strategy and company growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Ultimately, the partnership between Sovereign and Rewardify demonstrated the vital [[role_of_volume_in_ad_performance | role of volume in ad performance]] and creative velocity in [[scaling_and_iterating_on_successful_ad_variations | scaling and iterating on successful ad variations]] for mobile user acquisition, particularly in the competitive mobile gaming industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

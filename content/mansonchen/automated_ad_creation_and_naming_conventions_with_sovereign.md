Sovereign has proven to be highly effective for gaming companies, addressing the critical need for creative velocity in user acquisition (UA) efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This tool is designed to save significant time for UA teams by [[automatic_video_ad_creation | automating video ad creation]] and managing variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Rewardify Case Study

Dan, the Head of Mobile User Acquisition at Rewardify, experienced substantial success using Sovereign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Rewardify is a real cash rewards gaming company with over a million satisfied players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Dan's team is small, consisting of an art director, a playable ads designer, and a video artist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. While others handle social media and lifecycle marketing, Dan is primarily responsible for creating video ads and their variations for user acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Their main UA channel is AppLovin, which is reliable and avoids policy issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. AppLovin, similar to Meta and TikTok, thrives on creative velocity and a large number of ad variations to allow its algorithm to optimize performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### The Challenge

Dan recognized the necessity of creating more video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. However, his responsibilities, including leadership decisions, made it difficult to prioritize this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The manual process of opening editing software like CapCut was tedious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This involved:

*   Pairing top hooks with top bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   Testing new hooks with new body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   Dealing with [[ad_naming_conventions_and_tracking | naming conventions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Manually creating variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

He simply lacked the time to manage these tasks manually at the end of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This highlights the [[importance_of_naming_conventions_in_performance_marketing | importance of naming conventions in performance marketing]] and the struggle of manual creative iteration.

### The Solution: Automated Ad Creation and Naming

Sovereign provided a streamlined solution for Rewardify's ad creation needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Using a [[modular_approach_to_video_ad_creation | modular approach to video ad creation]], Dan could upload his video hooks and main body videos separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Sovereign then automatically combined them to generate new ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Key features of Sovereign's solution include:
*   **Automatic Combination**: Automatically pairs uploaded hooks and body videos to create numerous ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This directly supports [[using_sovereignai_for_automating_creative_testing | automating creative testing]] by rapidly generating testable assets.
*   **Standardized Export Sizes**: Exports ads in all standard sizes suitable for platforms like AppLovin, including 9x16, 1x1, 4x5, and 16x9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Custom Naming Conventions**: Automatically names exported files according to the user's custom naming convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This feature is crucial for [[setting_up_effective_ad_naming_conventions | setting up effective ad naming conventions]] and streamlining tracking.

## Results and Impact

Sovereign allowed Dan and his team to significantly boost creative testing on their largest UA channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

> [00:03:55] ![[Results]]
> With Sovereign, Dan and the team were able to boost creative testing on their largest UA Channel by **170% month over month** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

This surge reflects a strategic shift towards more aggressive testing and iteration of their top-performing ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. By exploring new combinations of hooks and body videos, they discovered new top-scaling ads and identified themes that might not have been tested otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This highlights the effectiveness of [[using_ai_tools_to_increase_ad_creatives | using AI tools to increase ad creatives]].

In conclusion, Dan was able to produce many more video ads in less time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This freed him up to focus on other critical aspects of his job, such as product strategy and overall company growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

This article shares insights into the world of B2B marketing, entrepreneurship, and the future of advertising, drawing from the experiences of two founders who connected over shared interests in ad metrics and building businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Journeys into Marketing

Both speakers began their careers in diverse fields before converging on paid social and marketing:

*   **From "Growth Hacker" to "Advertiser"**: One founder started his career with an internship at HelloFresh, building the company in the Netherlands, experiencing rapid growth from a small team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. He then co-founded a startup in London called Urle, later Melba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. After the startup failed, he started working for himself, initially calling himself a "growth hacker" on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. He found that Facebook ads were making the most impact for his first client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Changing his LinkedIn title from "growth hacker" to "advertiser" led to an influx of assignments during a period when Facebook advertising was booming for startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **From Copywriting to Paid Social**: The other founder initially explored real estate and database consulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. He got into advertising by reading copywriting books by classics like Ogilvy, driven by a curiosity about why people buy things they don't need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. He then worked as an affiliate marketer, learning a lot but also losing money, which he considered a fine risk to take when younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. His "aha moment" regarding why ads work came from realizing the importance of a great product, particularly during his time at Calm during COVID-19, where he felt he was "making the world a better place" through empathetic scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. A strong brand and product are essential for ads to work, impacting metrics like LTV (Customer Lifetime Value) and CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## [[Brand versus performance marketing strategies | Brand vs Performance Marketing]]

There's an "eternal battle" between [[Brand vs Performance Marketing | brand and performance marketing]] teams due to their often opposing goals: short-term results for performance and long-term, harder-to-measure results for brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

*   **Prioritizing Objectives**: Companies often have to decide where they sit on a spectrum of prioritizing CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) at all costs versus keeping the brand intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. If 100% on brand, performance marketing can suffer; if 100% on performance, the brand can suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Stage of Company Growth**:
    *   For companies up to Series A funding, CEOs often prioritize CPA almost at all costs to meet fundraising goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. For example, a CEO explicitly allowed almost any ad content, even referencing other brands, as long as it didn't involve Disney due to their litigious history with copyright law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
    *   More mature companies prioritize brand to win customers globally in the long term, as trust ultimately scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Balancing Act**: While a strong brand and product encourage purchases, the best ads often do not follow strict brand guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Some companies, like Corology, use "insane visual hooks" in their ads that initially seem unrelated to their brand, yet drive engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

## The Impact of AI on Marketing

The increasing availability of computing power, as described by Ray Kurzweil's concept of exponential technological growth, means that individuals can perform many more actions than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. This will lead to:

*   **Increased Information Supply**: It will become much easier to create and distribute content, such as thousands of videos per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   **Information Overload**: Humans have biological limits on information consumption, leading to a default state where people ignore most messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. This creates a more competitive environment for getting messages heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Steeper Success Curve**: The world will become more exponential, leading to a situation where a few people achieve extreme success, while many others do not, making it a more competitive landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.

### Counterbalancing AI with [[Authenticity in Marketing | Authenticity]]

As AI enables personalization at scale and generates more content, the counterbalance will be a greater emphasis on [[Authenticity in Marketing | authenticity]] and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

*   **Be Yourself**: "No one can be yourself... if you try to be someone else then that's not going to work for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. People are already tuning out AI-generated content, like fake LinkedIn comments and posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   **Tell Your Story**: Leverage your unique experiences and find "nonlinear ways to cut through the noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.
*   **AI as a Tool**: AI can assist with content creation, such as turning video transcripts into blog posts, adding to the text supply in an authentic way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

## [[Learning from entrepreneurial mistakes | Entrepreneurial Lessons]]

Running an agency and [[solo_bootstrapping_a_b2b_saas | solo bootstrapping a B2B SaaS]] has provided several "light bulb moments":

*   **Impactful Content**: Native-looking content, such as memes, can yield "insane results" and be far more effective than traditional ads, even with large marketing budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. This aligns with the concept of "ugly ads" that fit seamlessly into a feed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
*   **Systems and Processes**: "Nothing works when you don't have processes and systems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. This common advice only becomes truly apparent when implemented effectively.
*   **Hiring Outliers**: It's crucial to find "t-shaped" or "L-shaped" individuals who are truly exceptional (the "1% of the 1% in the world") in one specific domain, even if they lack broader skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. These individuals can make a product exceptional, even if it comes with challenges in team dynamics.
*   **Balancing Acquisition and Retention**: For [[solo_bootstrapping_a_b2b_saas | solo bootstrapping a B2B SaaS]], the challenge shifts from solely user acquisition to optimizing onboarding and retention to increase trial-to-subscribe rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. This involves being hands-on with onboarding training sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

### Product Development and [[Creative testing in marketing campaigns | Creative Testing]]

The speaker's product, Srun, addresses the need for efficient [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] in video ads. Its key feature allows users to:

*   Create dozens of "hook variations" at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.
*   Stitch these hooks onto core body videos by uploading visual hooks and applying multiple text overlays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
*   This approach helps to "explode the amount of hook variations you're testing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.
*   The first few seconds of an ad are crucial for attention, as "creative is a new targeting," primarily driven by that initial impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

Ultimately, the process of building a business is challenging but rewarding, especially when receiving positive customer testimonials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

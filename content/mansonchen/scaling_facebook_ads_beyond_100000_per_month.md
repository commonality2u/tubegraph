This guide outlines a five-week creative testing roadmap designed to help businesses [[Scaling Facebook Ads – Link name: scaling_facebook_ads | scale Facebook ad spend]] beyond $100,000 per month profitably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The strategies are based on experience managing seven to eight-figure monthly Facebook ad budgets for companies like Uber and DoorDash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

This roadmap is particularly useful if you're struggling to [[Scaling ad spend on Facebook – Link name: scaling_ad_spend_on_facebook | scale your Facebook ad spend]] without increasing your Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Ad Campaigns

To implement this strategy effectively, you should maintain a separate creative testing campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Winning ads from this testing campaign should always be moved to an Evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Proven Results
The strategies have helped subscription brands break long plateaus and achieve significant scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. For one brand, ad spend more than doubled while [[CPA and scaling ads – Link name: cpa_and_scaling_ads | CPA]] decreased by 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## The 5-Week Creative Testing Roadmap

### Week 1: Message Testing
The message is considered the "lowest hanging fruit" variable to test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

#### Process
1.  **Customer Research:** Gather data from App Store reviews, testimonials, customer surveys, and interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
2.  **Identify Key Themes:** Use tools like ChatGPT or NotebookLM by Google to surface top pains, problems, aspirations, and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
3.  **Low-Fi Ad Formats:** Convert these insights into short, snappy testimonials and messages for very low-effort, low-fidelity static ad formats, such as whiteboard or post-it designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. These low-fi formats often outperform more polished ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

#### Homework
*   Develop at least four different angles for your messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. These angles can focus on making customers feel good/happy, saving time/money, reducing stress, improving themselves, celebrating holidays (seasonality), or creating controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   Create four static low-fidelity ad formats to test these messages cost-effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   Keep the ad format consistent to avoid introducing additional variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   Run these tests in your creative testing campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   Move winning ads to your Evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Week 2: Concept Testing
A "concept" is defined as any high-level visual distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Minor changes like background colors, headlines, or aspect ratios are considered iterations, not new concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

#### Examples of Concepts
*   Whiteboard concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>
*   Handwriting concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
*   Founder story concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>
*   Text overlay/waterfall concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   Oddly satisfying split frame concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>
*   Hi-Fi static concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>

#### Homework
*   Create four different concepts, utilizing the best message identified in Week 1 to keep the message consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   Test two different image concepts and two different video concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   Seek inspiration from trending organic content and what competitors or adjacent companies are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   The top concepts (lowest CAC or highest spend) will be used in Week 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Week 3: Script Testing
A script is the sales copy or voiceover that runs throughout video ads, or the text on image ads, designed to convert prospects into customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Scripts should be based on the winning pain point or message from Week 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

#### Script Frameworks
All these frameworks typically start with a text hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

1.  **Problem-Solution:**
    *   Present the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>
    *   Present your solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>
    *   Explain the onboarding process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>
    *   Discuss benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>
    *   End with a Call to Action (CTA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>

2.  **Differentiator:**
    *   Polarize your solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
    *   Talk about your unique mechanism/what differentiates your solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>
    *   Introduce your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
    *   Go into benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>
    *   Include social proof (results, testimonials) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>
    *   End with a CTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>

3.  **Pain Point:**
    *   Talk about the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>
    *   Agitate the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>
    *   Introduce your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
    *   Differentiate your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>
    *   Discuss benefits of using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>
    *   Include social proof (results, testimonials) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
    *   End with a CTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>

These frameworks offer infinite combinations by varying elements like text hooks, problem presentation, differentiation, benefits, and social proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

#### Homework
*   Select two different script frameworks to test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   Use the lowest CAC video ad concept from Week 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   For each script framework, create four different text hook variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   Test two different ad sets (one for each script framework), each with four hook variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   Launch them to identify variants with the lowest CAC and highest spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Week 4: Visual Hooks
While Week 3 focused on text hooks, Week 4 introduces visual hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. These are visually engaging clips, usually lasting around 3 seconds, that open a video ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. They are highly effective at increasing your hook rate, thereby improving video ad performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. AI tools, such as sovereign.ai, can quickly generate these visual hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

#### Examples of Visual Hooks
*   AI dog visual hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>
*   Viral cat visual hook (as seen in a Better Me ad) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>
*   Toilet paper with handwriting and text overlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>
*   Green screen User-Generated Content (UGC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>

#### Homework
*   Film, generate with AI, or brief a creator to produce visual hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. This is typically the most flexible, cheapest, and fastest approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   Test these new visual hooks with the best video ad iterations from Week 3 (those with the lowest CAC or highest spend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   Crucially, keep all other elements consistent, including the text hook and the body of the sales script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### Week 5: Iterations
This week focuses on refining and extending the life of your winning ads through various iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

#### Iteration Strategies
*   **Duration:** Increase or decrease the duration of your winning video ads, or those close to your target CAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Pace:** Adjust the pace of the ad. For older demographics, consider decreasing the pace (increasing the time messages are on screen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. For a younger, Gen Z demographic, maintain a quick, snappy pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Creators:** If you have a winning video ad concept (e.g., a founder story), iterate by using an internal social marketing team member or hiring an external creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Scene Reordering:** Reorder the scenes within the timeline of your video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

### Continuous Testing
The roadmap is not meant to be a one-time process. You should continuously re-test elements from previous weeks, such as messages, low-fidelity concepts, or scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. By consistently applying these principles, you will continue to see results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

To effectively scale on Meta platforms, a high volume of creative content is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The key to profitable scaling is to lower your cost per new ad creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Many advertisers may be spending excessive time and money on [[creating_video_ads_faster | creating video ads]] if they do not adopt a modular approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## [[modular_approach_to_video_ad_creation | Modular Approach to Video Ad Creation]]

Think of your video ads as building blocks or Lego pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Video ads typically follow a structure: a hook, a body video, and a call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The efficiency comes from reusing these video blocks and measuring their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Measuring Effectiveness with Soft Metrics

By tracking specific metrics, you can identify which components need improvement without recreating the entire ad:
*   **Hook Rate**: A custom metric in Facebook (3-second video view divided by impression). If it falls below 30%, test swapping out only the hook while keeping other elements constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Hold Rate**: Defined as a through-play or a 15-second video view divided by impression. If this metric is below 10%, test swapping out the body while keeping the rest of the ad the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: If your CTR is below 1%, test swapping out the call to action, keeping everything else consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

This strategy allows for the creation of net new video ads by simply switching up components within the video timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. You can mix and match different clips rather than [[creating_video_ad_concepts | creating new concepts]] from scratch every time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This iterative process allows for improvement over time based on performance data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, drastically reducing ad creative costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

For example, hooks can start with a visual metaphor for a problem, an unboxing clip, or something oddly satisfying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The body can transition from an unboxing video to benefits, then a product demo, and finally results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Cost-Effective Asset Sourcing

Your primary task is to compile these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>:

*   **Self-Filming**: Filming content yourself on a phone can yield great results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Freelancers/Platforms**: Hire individuals to film content and obtain usage rights through platforms like Billow or Insense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **[[using_aigenerated_content_in_video_ads | Generative AI (GenAI)]]**: This is an increasingly popular and cost-effective method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   Create AI-generated UGC (User-Generated Content) using platforms like TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   Utilize services for creating GenAI avatars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   Generate b-roll footage using tools such as Runway Gen 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Using GenAI can slash overall ad costs in half and significantly [[improving_video_ad_performance | improve your Media Efficiency Ratio (MER)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. While testing ads incurs costs, sourcing content also has expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Given that ads are a numbers game, it's crucial to find ways to test more ads without excessive spending, especially when competing with vast amounts of paid and organic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

A study by AppsFlyer found that less than 2% of ads account for over 68% of ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Creative strategists are often wrong more than they are right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>; therefore, the goal is to create more "shots on goal" through a repeatable, cost-effective process to identify winning ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

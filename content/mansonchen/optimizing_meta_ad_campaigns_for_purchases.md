Optimizing Meta ad campaigns, particularly for purchases, heavily relies on effective [[creative_strategy_and_testing_for_meta_ads | creative testing]]. Many teams understand the importance of testing creatives but may not know the exact methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. While there's no universal approach, this structure can be adapted to specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This method has been used to test 50 to 100 ads per week on Meta, with spending reaching up to $6 million per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Setting Up Your Creative Testing Campaign

To effectively test creatives on Meta, dedicate a specific campaign for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

### Dedicated Creative Testing Campaign
Create a dedicated creative testing campaign with test ad sets (e.g., Test Adset 1, 2, 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Each test ad set houses different ad tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

### Optimization Event
The optimization event for your creative testing campaign should match your Evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>. For instance, if your Evergreen campaign is [[optimizing_for_purchases_and_trial_starts | optimizing for purchases]], your creative testing campaign should also optimize for purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>. For app install campaigns, it's generally recommended to [[optimizing_for_purchases_and_trial_starts | optimize for trial starts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.

### Adset Daily Budget & Conversions
The daily budget on the adset level should aim to achieve 50 conversions in a week at your average Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>. For example, if your average CPA is $10, an adset daily budget of about $70 is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

Although Facebook recently changed the learning phase requirement from 50 conversions in a week to about 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>, having more conversions on the adset level generally leads to more stable performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Therefore, it's still recommended to aim for at least 50 conversions per week on your adset tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

## Structuring Adset Tests

Ads within each adset test one specific variable to isolate what is working or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:01">[02:10:01]</a>.

### Isolating Variables
For example, in one adset, the only difference between ads might be the "hook" (e.g., text headline, visual, or audio portion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:02">[02:14:02]</a>. In another, only the "body" of the ad would differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### Key Elements to Test
The most important elements to test are your hooks (text headline, visual hook, and especially the audio hook) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>, and the beginning of the body video (first frame, or problem statement after the hook) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

*   **Hook**: The initial part of the ad designed to capture attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. This can include text headlines, visual elements, or audio components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Body**: Comprises the script (e.g., using frameworks like Problem-Agitate-Solution, three-reason listicles, unique mechanisms, educational scripts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, music/voiceover, visual sequence/concept (e.g., 3D motion graphics, UGC ads, talking head ads, podcast ads, founder story ads, skit ads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   **Call to Action (CTA)**: While testable, CTAs are not as crucial as the hook or the start of the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. The average video view duration for most ads is 5-6 seconds, so testing the hook and the beginning of the body covers 60-75% of your video ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

## Judging Ad Performance and Iteration

Ads are primarily judged based on their CPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. Aim for at least 30 conversions on an ad before deciding to duplicate it into the Evergreen campaign or pause it, ensuring confidence in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

### Upper Funnel Metrics to Consider
*   **Link Click-Through Rate (CTR)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>
*   **Hook Rate**: 3-second video view divided by impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>
*   **Hold Rate**: Through-play (15 seconds watched) divided by impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>

### [[iterating_and_improving_meta_ads | Iteration Playbooks]]
Here are rough playbooks for [[iterating_and_improving_meta_ads | iterating and improving Meta ads]] based on performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>:

*   **Hook Rate above 30% but CPA is bad**: This indicates the hook is good, but the rest of the ad isn't converting. Test different body videos with the same hook, focusing on scripts, visuals, or music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.
*   **Hold Rate around 10% and CPA is bad**: People are watching past 15 seconds, but not converting. Test different hooks, creators, visuals, music, or scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.
*   **Hook Rate less than 30% and CPA is bad**: The hook is not capturing attention. Test different hooks, headlines, creators, visuals, or music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

## Duplicating Winners to Evergreen Campaigns

When an ad achieves your CPA goal with a significant amount of spend, duplicate it from your testing campaign into your Evergreen campaign and adset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. Your Evergreen campaign should house all your creative winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

### Importance of Separate Campaigns
Having a separate Evergreen campaign and a dedicated creative testing campaign is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. Sometimes, an ad might have excellent upper-funnel performance (high hook rate, high install rate) but doesn't lead to deeper conversions like trial starts or subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. If these ads are in your Evergreen campaign, Meta will spend heavily on them because they capture attention, even if they don't convert for your app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. This can negatively impact your Evergreen campaign's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. Therefore, keeping testing separate prevents non-converting, high upper-funnel ads from "wrecking" your main [[optimizing_and_scaling_facebook_ad_campaigns | optimizing and scaling Facebook ad campaigns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

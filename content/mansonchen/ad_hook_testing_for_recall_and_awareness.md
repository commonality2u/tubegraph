From: [[mansonchen]] <br/> 

The initial seconds of an ad significantly influence its impact on recall and awareness. Research conducted by TikTok in 2021 indicated that 50% of an ad's total impact on recall and awareness occurs within the first 2 to 2.5 seconds, a finding that likely remains relevant or even more so today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. To leverage this, it is crucial to [[scientific_approach_to_testing_ad_hooks | scientifically]] test ad [[importance_of_video_ad_hooks_in_marketing | hooks]] to identify what resonates with your audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Initial Ad Hook Testing Sprint

For the first sprint of your [[importance_of_testing_hooks_for_video_ads | hook testing]], the goal is to test multiple [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | visual Hooks]] and [[script_and_messaging_testing_for_ads | text hooks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Example: Mud Water's Approach

Mud Water provides an example of this testing methodology:
*   **Visual Hook:** Consistent across tests, showing someone chopping a lion's mane mushroom with a knife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Text Hooks:** Varied to isolate the variable, such as:
    *   "Lion's main is the secret to killing brain fog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
    *   "2,240 mg of functional mushrooms in this drink" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Body Video:** All [[importance_of_hooks_in_video_ads | hooks]] lead to the same body video, allowing for the isolation of the [[creating_engaging_text_hooks_in_ads | text hook]] as the specific variable influencing metrics like CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) or hook rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Setting Up Ad Set Tests

When testing [[importance_of_video_ad_hooks_in_marketing | hooks]], it's essential to organize them logically within ad set tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. If you have four different [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | visual Hooks]] and two different [[script_and_messaging_testing_for_ads | text hooks]], you can structure your test as follows:
*   **Ad Set A:** Pair all four [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | visual Hooks]] with [[creating_engaging_text_hooks_in_ads | text hook]] A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Ad Set B:** Pair all four [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | visual Hooks]] with [[creating_engaging_text_hooks_in_ads | text hook]] B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

To ensure confidence in your results, aim for at least 50 conversions per ad set within a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Allocate sufficient budget to achieve this conversion volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Analyzing and Iterating on Winning Hooks

After running your tests, you'll likely find that some [[importance_of_video_ad_hooks_in_marketing | hooks]] perform significantly better than others, often evidenced by a much-improved CPA compared to your control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Identifying and Storing Winners

Once winning [[importance_of_hooks_in_video_ads | hooks]] are identified (e.g., [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | visual hook]] 2 and [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | visual hook]] 4 with common [[creating_engaging_text_hooks_in_ads | text hook]] B), store them in a [[organizing_visual_hooks_for_ads | winning hooks database]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This database can be a mind map or an Excel sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Further Testing and Iteration

You can then test these winning [[importance_of_video_ad_hooks_in_marketing | hook]] elements, such as [[creating_engaging_text_hooks_in_ads | text hook]] B, with your best-performing body videos or promising new body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This strategy helps increase your creative win rate and can transform a losing concept into a winning ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Iterating on Proven Hooks

To [[testing_and_iterating_ad_concepts | iterate]] further, take your best-performing [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | visual hooks]] (e.g., visual hook 2 and 4) and the common winning [[creating_engaging_text_hooks_in_ads | text hook]] (Text Hook B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   Test variations of [[creating_engaging_text_hooks_in_ads | text hook]] B with both [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | visual hook]] 2 and [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | visual hook]] 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   You can also test [[creating_engaging_text_hooks_in_ads | text hook]] B with [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | iterations]] of [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | visual hook]] 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

Measure the performance of these new [[testing_and_iterating_ad_concepts | iterations]] against your previous winners by tracking spend, CPA, ROAS, or hook rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. By keeping proven elements like [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | visual hook]] 2, [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | visual hook]] 4, and [[creating_engaging_text_hooks_in_ads | text hook]] B constant while introducing new ones, you control variables and minimize downside risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

Users can scroll through images, take inspiration, and even copy existing prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
2.  **Image Creation**: Utilize the copied prompt on AI image generation platforms such as Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Stable Diffusion XL to create unique images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Users can generate multiple images and select their preferred one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
3.  **Video Conversion**: Convert the chosen image into a video clip using tools like RunwayML.com's Gen-2 model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This AI model transforms a still image into a dynamic video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

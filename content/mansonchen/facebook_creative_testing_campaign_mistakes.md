When conducting [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads|creative testing for Facebook ads]], certain campaign types and setups can lead to wasted ad spend and inaccurate results. A common, yet expensive, mistake made by newer advertisers is not understanding how to properly set up their [[creative_testing_campaigns|creative testing campaigns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Mistake: Using Advantage Shopping+ (ASC) Campaigns for Creative Testing

The exact campaign type to avoid for [[creative_testing_in_facebook_ads|creative testing]] is the Advantage Shopping+ (ASC) campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

### Why ASC is Problematic for Creative Testing

*   **Winner-Take-All Algorithm**: The Facebook algorithm operates on a "winner take all" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This means that typically one or two ads within an ad set will receive the majority of the spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. If you upload 50 ads into an ASC campaign, only one will likely receive most of the spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   **Algorithm's Probabilistic Nature**: While Facebook promises to find the winning ad, its algorithm is probabilistic and can make mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Chance of Error with More Ads**: The more ads you include in one ad set, the higher the chance that the algorithm will pick the wrong one to spend on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Misleading Early Funnel Metrics**: Early funnel metrics, such as click-through rate (CTR) and view duration, can disproportionately influence ad delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. An ad might be "clickbaity" and get initial engagement but fail to convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Low Probability of Identifying a Winner**: If you have 50 ads in an ad set within an ASC campaign, there's only approximately a 2% chance that Facebook will pick the *right* winning ad right out of the gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

### Case Study: The Adtech App Founder

An adtech app founder experienced this problem firsthand when running [[creative_testing_in_facebook_ads|creative testing]] in an Advantage Shopping+ campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   The first three ads that received spend were generating a high cost per trial, ranging from $40 to $50, which was not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
*   After pausing these underperforming ads, a fourth ad began receiving spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This ad achieved a cost per trial of just $8, which was five to six times better than the initial ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. This highlights how a truly winning ad can be overlooked when using the wrong campaign setup for testing.

## Recommended Alternative: Adset Budget Optimization (ABO) Campaigns

To avoid these pitfalls, it is recommended to use Adset Budget Optimization (ABO) campaigns for [[effective_creative_testing_strategies_on_facebook|creative testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.
*   **Manual Budget Control**: ABO campaigns allow advertisers to set the daily budget for each individual ad set within the campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   **Higher Probability of Finding Winners**: With an ad set test containing, for example, four ad variants, there's a 25% chance that Facebook will pick the right one at the outset, a significantly higher chance than with ASC campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **Objective Pausing**: ABO allows for quickly and objectively pausing underperforming ads using defined triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Efficiency**: While this method may involve more upfront spend, it significantly increases the chances of finding the best-performing ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

Once winning ads are identified and proven in an ABO [[creative_testing_in_facebook_ads|creative testing]] campaign, they can then be moved into Advantage Shopping+ campaigns for [[scaling_facebook_ads|scaling Facebook Ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. At this stage, it matters less which ad Facebook picks, as all ads in the scaling campaign are already known to be effective and have a low Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

The [[modular_approach_to_video_ad_creation | modular approach]] to video ad creation involves breaking down video ads into distinct, interchangeable [[building_block_selection_for_video_ads | building blocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This strategy allows advertisers to test different components independently and maximize the effectiveness of their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Top advertisers, like Dr. Squatch, commonly employ this [[modular_design_in_video_ads | modular way]] of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Components of a Modular Video Ad

Video ads are typically created in a [[modular_approach_to_video_ad_creation | modular way]], consisting of hooks, body videos, and a call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Hooks

Hooks are designed to stop the scroll and capture audience attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Dr. Squatch, a massive soap brand primarily selling to men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, uses various hooks for their deodorant products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

*   **Text Hooks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:
    *   "Women will go feral for this natural deodorant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
    *   "Do you know why she likes it natural" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>
    *   "Why women will go feral for this Dr Squatch deodorant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
    *   "3 reasons this deodorant dangerous for your love life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
    *   Common text hook characteristics: white text on a blue background, or white with a black stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>; text placed at the top of the 9x16 safe zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Visual Hooks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>:
    *   Frequent use of split frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   Left side of the split frame: consistently a visual of deodorant or deodorant peeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
    *   Right side of the split frame: visuals include a naked hairy old man, a girl in a towel smelling deodorant, or a girl smelling a man's armpit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. These visuals aim to capture the attention of single men, Dr. Squatch's primary audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Audio Hooks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>:
    *   A girl's voice stating: "This is what a man should smell like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> and "I will literally jump on any man wearing this scent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Body Videos

Following the hooks, the "body" or "onramp" videos provide more information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Dr. Squatch utilizes different body video concepts:

*   **Body 1**: A listicle format, such as "three reasons why," serving as an educational explainer about natural ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Visual Themes in Body Videos** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>:
    1.  Attractive women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
    2.  Men applying deodorant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
    3.  Women showing attraction to the men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Dr. Squatch often uses the same body video with different visual or text hooks, demonstrating how different [[script_frameworks_for_video_ad_creation | script frameworks]] can be combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. They also reorder clips within the same script to create new variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Call to Actions (CTAs)

Call to actions prompt the viewer to take the next step. Dr. Squatch uses multiple CTAs:

*   **CTA 1**: "Just click this video right now to change your pit game forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **CTA 2**: "These deodorants sell out quick so I'd hop on this while you can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
Both CTAs are often accompanied by a visual lineup of Dr. Squatch deodorant products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## The Strategy Behind Modularity

The essence of a [[modular_creative_strategy_for_video_ads | modular creative strategy]] is to think in terms of [[building_block_selection_for_video_ads | building blocks]] that can be combined and recombined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. For example, various text hooks can lead into the same [[script_frameworks_for_video_ads | "three reasons why" script]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Advertisers can experiment with coherence levels in their [[script frameworks for video ads | scripts]] and use the same video clips in different orders to maximize the effectiveness of existing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This approach to [[creating_video_ad_concepts | creating video ad concepts]] allows for efficient testing and optimization, potentially [[reducing_reliance_on_agencies_for_video_ads | reducing reliance on external agencies]] by enabling in-house experimentation.

## Key Takeaways

*   Video ads are best created in a [[modular_approach_to_video_ad_creation | modular way]], using hooks, body videos, and calls to action as distinct [[building_block_selection_for_video_ads | building blocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   When testing video ads, it is crucial to test one variable at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   Winning ads are often a result of a systematic, [[modular_creative_strategy_for_video_ads | process-driven approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

One of the key mental models to guide [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative strategy testing]] is the scientific process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This approach is specifically for "creative strategy nerds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Principles of the Scientific Process

The core principle of this mental model is to isolate and test only one variable at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This ensures that experiments have a control group, allowing for clear identification of what led to performance changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Practical Application
*   **Testing Scripts and Creators**: You can test the same script with four different creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Testing Visual Hooks**: You can test the same video body with four different visual hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Controlling Variables**: In both scenarios, it's crucial to ensure everything else remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Avoiding Mixed Results
If you test a new concept and a new script simultaneously, you will not be able to determine which specific change led to better or worse performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Balancing Exploration and Exploitation

While the scientific process emphasizes controlled testing, it's acknowledged that "big swings" (testing multiple new elements at once) are acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. However, it's important to be aware that the win rate for these ads will be significantly lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Effective [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative strategy]] requires testing both the exploration phase (big swings) and the exploitation phase (iterating off of learnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Simply "throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks" is not an effective long-term strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Other Mental Models
> The scientific process is one of three mental models for [[principles_of_creative_testing_campaigns | creative strategy testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Other models include the [[alloying_concept_in_creative_strategy | alloying concept]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> and Natural Selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Sovran's latest version offers features designed to streamline and enhance creative production and testing for video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The platform emphasizes a [[modular_creative_strategy_for_video_ads | modular approach]] by allowing users to combine different assets like hooks, body videos, and call-to-action end cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This system enables rapid [[automating_creative_testing | creative remixing]] and iteration for performance marketers and creative strategists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Key Features for Creative Remixing

### Bulk Create Hooks
The [[bulk_create_hooks_feature_in_sovran | bulk create hooks]] feature allows users to select or upload visual hooks and pair them with various text hook variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   **Visual Hook Selection**: Users can choose from existing visual hooks or upload their own filmed content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Text Hook Customization**: Add multiple text hook versions, choose fonts, update sizes, and even upload custom fonts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Export Settings**: Select the final export ratio, highlight safe areas, and preview for platforms like Stories or TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Combinatorial Creation**: For example, two different text hooks combined with three different visual hooks will create six new hooks for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Create Asset (Video Editor)
This feature provides a video editor to create individual assets such as hooks, body videos, or call-to-action end cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Asset Library Integration**: Start by selecting assets from the library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

*   **Project Assignment**: Choose the project where the new asset will be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### AI Assets
[[AI tools for creative production and testing | AI assets]] allow for the generation of visual content, particularly useful for creating hooks and b-roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Image Generation**: Generate images from text prompts (e.g., "a cute puppy drinking coffee") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Image-to-Video Conversion**: Transform generated or uploaded images into 5-second videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **AI Scripts**: Use AI to generate scripts based on the image description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Creative Remixing Workflow
The main page for [[automating_video_ad_creation_with_sovran | creating video ads]] allows for comprehensive creative remixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
1.  **Asset Selection**:
    *   Select multiple hooks, body videos, and call-to-action end cards from your library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   Choose music tracks to iterate on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   This tells Sovran to merge selected hooks with body videos and music, creating various iterations (e.g., 9 text hooks with 1 body video and 3 music iterations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
2.  **Export Ratio**: Export videos in standard asset ratios like horizontal, square, vertical, and 9x16 vertical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
3.  **Asset Adjustments**: Adjust the start and end times, and audio levels for all selected assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
4.  **Custom Naming Conventions**: A critical feature for performance marketers is the ability to [[automated_ad_creation_and_naming_conventions_with_sovereign | customize ad naming conventions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   Dynamically pull names from hook, body, call-to-action, and audio file names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
    *   Customize separators and add custom fields (e.g., "Creator A," "Testing Round 2") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   Drag and drop to reorder the naming convention elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
5.  **Video Generation and Download**:
    *   After selecting assets and configuring settings, click "create videos" to generate all combinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
    *   For example, 27 videos can be created in approximately 5 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
    *   Download all videos as a zip file via email, ready for upload to platforms like Facebook, TikTok, or Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

This comprehensive approach allows for rapid creation, testing, and optimization of video ad creatives.

Alvin, founder of Ads by Alvin, discusses the significant [[challenges_of_starting_a_business | challenges of starting a business]] and the difficulties encountered while building a faceless YouTube channel, which is part of his broader aspirations to become a media company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

## From Paid Social to Entrepreneurship
Alvin has been in paid social since 2015, starting with paid search at Upwork where he was in charge of client acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. He then moved into Facebook advertising to go more top of funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. He recalls a past Facebook ad rule that limited text to 20% of an image, which was an annoying extra step for designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

After working at major companies like Upwork and Airbnb, Alvin started his own company, Ads by Alvin, in May 2020 after being laid off from Airbnb during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. He describes this period as "one door closing and another door opening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The initial months of starting the agency were spent getting his name out and acquiring clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Navigating Performance vs. Brand Marketing
Alvin emphasizes that brand and performance marketing work hand-in-hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. While performance marketers focus on measurable ROI, a strong brand in the marketplace makes conversion easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Brand, for him, represents the trust a company has with its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. He notes that brand campaigns can lead to better conversion rates, more organic and direct traffic, and more retargetable audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. He views it as naive for a performance marketer to discount brand as a waste of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Challenges in Building a YouTube Channel
Alvin's venture into faceless YouTube channels has proven to be one of the most challenging projects he has undertaken in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
### Key Challenges:
*   **Low Views:** Each new video typically receives only a few hundred views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. The ultimate goal for YouTube is to achieve millions of views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
*   **Defining Success Metrics:** Unlike growth marketing where ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) or contribution margin are key metrics, YouTube success is measured by "view duration per impression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>, which combines thumbnail click-through rate (CTR) and video retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   **Thumbnail as a Bottleneck:** Alvin identifies thumbnail creation as his main bottleneck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. It requires significant psychological understanding to create a "curiosity gap" that makes viewers stop scrolling, notice the thumbnail, become curious, click, and then watch the video without bouncing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. He aims for a 10% CTR on thumbnails but currently struggles at 3-4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
*   **Video Retention:** Achieving a flat retention curve, like prominent YouTubers such as MrBeast who maintain around 60% average retention, is crucial but difficult; Alvin's videos currently show a downward-sloping 20% retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

> "There's so much that goes into this and my bottleneck is the thumbnail for sure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>

These YouTube analytics share parallels with [[improving_video_ad_performance | video ad performance]] metrics in paid media, where factors like hook rate, average view duration, and CTR are crucial indicators of a good, low-CPA ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

## Media Aspirations and Storytelling
Alvin's long-term aspiration is to shift from running an agency to becoming a full-time media company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. This stems from his enjoyment of learning, telling stories, and sharing knowledge, a passion rooted in his childhood habit of going down Wikipedia rabbit holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. He views client services as a medium-term endeavor and desires to lean into the more naturally rewarding and interesting side of storytelling for the next 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.

> "I just want to tell stories and I want to share knowledge with people." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>

He is actively working towards this goal, with plans for the next two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

## Resources for Growth Marketers
Alvin shares his expertise through various channels. His website, Ads by Alvin, features an ad swipe file, and a collection of "growth playbooks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. These playbooks are designed to help others improve at growth marketing by sharing insights and lessons from his client work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>. The playbooks are comprehensive and include processes for [[creating_video_ad_concepts | ad concept creation]] and research, making them accessible to a wider audience without gatekeeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.

One common mistake in ad accounts is a lack of new [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creatives tested]] regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Brands and agencies sometimes fail to introduce new ad concepts for extended periods, such as three months or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Importance of Regular Creative Testing

Ads naturally experience fatigue over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Without consistently [[testing_and_iterating_ad_concepts | testing new creatives]], sustained growth becomes challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Recommended Testing Frequency

To combat ad fatigue and support continued growth, it is recommended to test new creatives:
*   **Every month** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   **Every week** if operating at a high spending level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>

## Impact of Ad Spend on Testing Frequency

The rate at which an ad fatigues is directly related to ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. As spending increases, ads will fatigue faster, necessitating a higher frequency of [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Prioritizing Creative Testing over Audience Testing

Some brands and agencies mistakenly focus on [[audience_testing_vs_creative_testing | audience testing]] (e.g., lookalike audiences, interest stacks) with the same creative, rather than prioritizing [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This approach can lead to cannibalization of efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. In 2024, creative is considered the "new targeting," making [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] more impactful for maximizing return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. It is advisable to focus on [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] and use broad targeting, especially when starting out, reserving interest or lookalike targeting for scaling up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

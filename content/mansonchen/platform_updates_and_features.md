## Key Features

The platform now includes:
*   **Tailored AI visual concepts** Concepts are generated by AI based on user input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Customizable Hooks** Users can customize their hooks by selecting from 10 distinct copywriting tones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Clearer Instructions** The platform now provides clearer instructions on its usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Process Overview

The video ad creation process on the platform involves several steps:
1.  **Company Information Input** Users begin by providing the company name and a description of what the company does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. For example, a company might be named "chicken" and "make delicious chicken sandwiches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
2.  **Tone Selection** Users then choose a copywriting tone from the 10 available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. An example tone is "assertive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
3.  **Clip Initialization** After selecting a tone, users click the "Initialize Clips" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This action triggers background AI processes for generating visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   The platform provides updated status messages, such as "clips are initializing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   The generation of AI visuals can take up to a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The status changes to "succeeded" once completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
4.  **Video Creation** Once clips are initialized, users can proceed to "create a video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
    *   The video rendering process begins with a "video status is queued" message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   The status updates to "video status done" when the final video rendering is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, and the video is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

The waitlist for the platform is currently open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

The landscape of finding "unicorn ads"—those that drive significant spend and performance—is challenging, with a study from AppsFlyer revealing that only 2% of ad variations capture 68% of ad spend, and 90% of spend goes to just 10% of ads. This doesn't even account for ads spending less than $50, meaning far fewer than 1 in 50 ads actually reach this level of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:05:10]</a>.

Historical data from Facebook (about eight years old) indicates that the fastest-growing advertisers tested 11 times more ads per month (45 versus 4), and the average variance in Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) between top and bottom-performing creatives was 11x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:55]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of iterative testing and continuous experimentation in the marketing funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:26]</a>.

More recent analysis by Verros, which looked at 5,000 Meta accounts, showed that advertisers spending $100K-$500K per month had an average of 335 active ads receiving over 20 impressions, while those spending $500K-$1M had 422 active ads. Smaller advertisers ($10K-$100K) had 103 active ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:07:15]</a>. This suggests a "chicken and egg" situation: high growth requires extensive ad testing, which in turn requires a substantial budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Emerging Ad Creative Trends for 2025

Several exciting creative trends are anticipated to gain prominence heading into 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Loi Ads (Low-Fidelity Ads)
Loi (low-fidelity) ads are unpolished and intentionally designed *not* to look like traditional advertisements, which is a key reason for their strong performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:30]</a>. Examples include ads resembling Post-it notes, whiteboard scribbles, iMessage chats, or Slack messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:40]</a>. These "sneaky" ads are effective because they blend in with organic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:43]</a>.

### AI UGC (User-Generated Content)
AI-generated UGC is a hot topic, significantly reducing the cost of production for these ad types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:57]</a>. Software such as Arc Ads, Pult, Day, Creatify, Captions AI, TikTok Creative Symphony, HeyGen, and CapCut are being used to create natural-looking AI-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:53]</a>. This technology greatly aids in achieving [[creative_diversity_in_ad_strategies | creative diversity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:27]</a>. While the exact split between AI-produced and actor-produced creatives is hard to pinpoint, AI-generated ads currently make up approximately 10-20% and offer a low production cost benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:11:19]</a>.

### AI Statics
[[AI visual concepts in advertising | AI-generated static ads]] allow for rapid testing and iteration of concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:55]</a>. Tools like Midjourney and Flux (an open-source text-to-image model) are valuable. A pro tip is to use platforms like Replicate.com/ai, which hosts many open-source text-to-image models, enabling API calls to generate hundreds of images at once. These can then be quickly customized with text overlays in tools like Canva, offering a much faster workflow than Discord-based interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:12:33]</a>.

### AI Video
Runway's Gen 3 is a leading tool for [[creating_video_ad_concepts | AI video]] production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:48]</a>. A key application is the creation of [[modular_creative_strategy_for_video_ads | AI visual hooks]] that lead to a main "body video." This allows advertisers to test various hooks while maintaining a consistent core message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:13:17]</a>.

While the overall approach to ad creative is similar for app and web campaigns, the main difference lies in optimization events. Web campaigns still benefit from user-level data, which is often limited or modeled for iOS campaigns (via Scan or Aggregated Event Management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:14:31]</a>.

### Podcast-Style Ads
Podcast-style ads are another interesting trend that performs very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:15:41]</a>. These ads mimic natural conversations, don't immediately appear as ads, and leverage the high trust placed in podcasts, especially in the US, compared to traditional media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:36]</a>. Their ability to immediately attract attention without appearing as an advertisement is a key advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:16:00]</a>.

## Foundations of a Successful Creative Testing Program

To build a successful ad account structure and performance, several foundations are crucial:
*   **Conversion API**: Implementing the Conversion API alongside the pixel provides Facebook with more signal, leading to better ad delivery decisions by the algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:58]</a>. Without it, approximately 15% of conversion data can be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:44]</a>.
*   **High Volume of Ad Variations**: Advertisers should create many ad variations and allow the audience to determine the best performers, as bottom-performing ads naturally receive less spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   **Low Cost per Creative**: Given that most ads will not meet performance benchmarks, keeping the cost of producing each creative low enables more extensive testing of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:18:08]</a>.
*   **Never Stop Testing**: Relying on a single winning ad is detrimental to scaling because ads eventually fatigue as spend increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:30]</a>. An "army of new ads" must always be ready to pick up spend and ensure continuous scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:43]</a>.

## Research Phase for Ad Creatives

Effective ad creation begins with thorough research to understand the audience and messaging:
*   **Leverage User Reviews with AI**: Upload customer reviews into tools like ChatGPT to identify concise, impactful testimonials that can be used as low-fidelity static ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:54]</a>. For example, testing 50 different testimonials to surface the top 3-5 can inform effective social proof and messaging for all video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:20:37]</a>.
*   **Use "Gigabrain" Tools**: Search online discussions (e.g., Reddit threads) to understand how people talk about your brand, category, or niche. This helps in adopting the authentic language of your target audience for ad copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **Analyze Post and Ad Comments**: Similar to online discussions, analyzing comments on posts and ads reveals the exact language and pain points of your audience, which can be directly incorporated into ad messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:55]</a>.
*   **Monitor Ad Libraries**: Tools like Motion Analytics offer free ad library tracking. Observing brands known for [[creative_diversity_in_ad_strategies | diverse]] and high-volume creative testing (e.g., Headway, Loop Earplugs, Ry Superfoods, BetterMe, Ry Science, Calm) provides valuable inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:36]</a>. Some advertisers even use similar visual hooks across brands, sometimes leveraging the same creative agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:23:09]</a>.

## [[Creative diversity in advertising | Creative Diversity]]

[[Creative diversity in advertising | Creative diversity]] involves systematically testing combinations of concepts and messages to find what works and then doubling down on those successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:21]</a>. This can be conceptualized through a mind map:
*   **Universal Human Motivators**: Identify core emotional drivers (e.g., pain points, desires) to form angles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:24:13]</a>.
*   **Stage of Awareness**: Tailor messaging based on audience awareness (unaware, problem-aware, solution-aware, product-aware, most aware). For example, static ads with testimonials are effective for bottom-of-funnel users, while video ads with problem/solution scripts work well for top-of-funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:45]</a>.
*   **Messaging Frameworks**: Experiment with different structures like listicles ("3 Reasons Why"), common myths, or problem-solution approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:56]</a>.
*   **Formats**: Once an angle and message are decided, explore various [[static_and_video_ad_formats_for_creative_strategy | ad formats]]:
    *   **Static Ad Formats**: Post-it notes, Reddit post screenshots, iMessage conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:19]</a>.
    *   **Video Formats**: AI UGC, talking head UGC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:24]</a>.

## [[Frequency of creative testing in ads | Creative Testing]] Setup

A structured approach to [[Frequency of creative testing in ads | creative testing]] is essential:
*   **Separate Testing Campaign**: Dedicate a distinct campaign for creative testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:35]</a>.
*   **Adset Concepts/Tests**: Within the testing campaign, use ad sets to test different concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:40]</a>.
*   **Ad Variations**: Each ad set should contain around 4-6 ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:45]</a>. When testing, isolate one variable (e.g., different text hooks or visual hooks) while keeping all other elements consistent to accurately measure impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:27:03]</a>.
*   **Promotion of Winning Ads**: Ads that meet Key Performance Indicator (KPI) goals ("green ads") should be moved to an "Evergreen ad set" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:13]</a>. Iterate on "green" and "yellow" performers, while stopping iterations on "red" (non-performing) ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:26]</a>.
*   **Targeting and Budget**: Use broad country-level targeting for delivery volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:30]</a>. Allocate 10-20% of the Facebook budget to always-on [[frequency_of_creative_testing_in_ads | creative testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:44]</a>, starting ad sets with $100-$200 daily budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:34]</a>.
*   **Stop-Loss Triggers**: Implement automated stop-loss triggers on ads within the testing campaign to ensure objective and cost-effective testing. Examples include pausing an ad if it spends 3x the Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) goal without a conversion, or if its CPA exceeds a certain threshold after reaching a higher spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:28:26]</a>. This prevents underspending or overspending on tests, ensuring every ad gets a minimum impression/reach level before a decision is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:20]</a>.

### Evergreen Scaling Setup

Once winning ads are identified, they should be scaled effectively:
*   **Use Post IDs**: Instead of duplicating ads, use the existing post ID from the winning ad. This consolidates social proof (likes, comments, shares) across all instances of the ad, which performs better than fragmented social proof from duplicated posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:58]</a>. The post ID can be found in the URL of the Facebook post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:29:13]</a>.
*   **Bid Caps or Cost Caps**: For Evergreen campaigns, use bid caps or cost caps with very high daily budgets. This ensures that delivery is capped by your cost goal rather than being limited by daily budget, which can happen with lowest cost or auto-bid settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:30:05]</a>.
    *   For cost caps, start 25-30% above your CPA goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:40]</a>.
    *   For bid caps, one strategy is to start high and gradually decrease if daily budget is maxed out. Changes to bid caps should be around 20% per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:44:27]</a>.
*   **Broad Targeting**: Maintain broad targeting, excluding current subscribers, and continuously feed the campaign with fresh creative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:12]</a>.
*   **Ad Set Structure**: Facebook and Smartly data suggest that around six ads per ad set is the optimal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:51]</a>.
*   **Bid Multipliers API**: If possible, get your account whitelisted for Facebook's Bid Multipliers API. This allows bidding higher on high LTV (Lifetime Value) demographics (e.g., females over 40) and lower on low LTV demographics (e.g., 18-24), optimizing delivery within broad targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:31:23]</a>.
*   **Flexible Ads / Dynamic Creative**: This ad type, where multiple videos/images, texts, and headlines are uploaded into one ad unit, is effective for testing and can scale well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:41:45]</a>. However, it does not allow for obtaining post IDs for social proof consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:27]</a>.

## Measurement and Optimisation

*   **Facebook's Ad Reporting Tool**: Utilize Facebook's free ad reporting tool for easy setup and monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:43]</a>. Color-coding based on cost per result (CPA) helps quickly identify performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:52]</a>.
*   **Creative Hit Rate**: Monitor the creative hit rate, defined as the number of creatives that hit your CPA goal divided by the total number of creatives tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:10]</a>. A 10% creative hit rate is considered very good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:22]</a>.
*   **Benchmarks**:
    *   **Hook Rate**: 3-second video view / impressions; aim for >30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:33]</a>.
    *   **Hold Rate**: 15-second video view (through-play) / impressions; aim for ~10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:43]</a>.
    *   **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: Link CTR should be above 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:48]</a>.
*   **Standardized Naming Convention**: Adhere to a consistent naming convention at the ad level. This allows for easy data analysis (e.g., in Excel with pivot tables) to identify working concepts, text hooks, visual hooks, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:33:06]</a>.
*   **Continuous Refresh**: Maintain an always-on creative testing campaign to continuously feed new creative into Evergreen ad sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:11]</a>. When winning ads start to fatigue (e.g., CTR drops, CPA increases, observed over a 7-14 day rolling average), pause them and replace them with pre-tested ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:48]</a>.
*   **New Concepts vs. Iterations**: Start with a 50/50 mix of new concepts and iterations. If struggling to find winners or facing ad fatigue, shift to a 70/30 split favoring brand new concepts to find new "local maximums" in creative performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:36:35]</a>.
*   **Most Impactful Creative Elements**: While a good visual is important (40%), the **message** is the most impactful creative element (60%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:22]</a>. Agencies often A/B test visual and text hooks to precisely identify what resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:38]</a>.

Ultimately, maintaining an open mind and continuously experimenting is key, as it's impossible to predict which creative will work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:24]</a>.

Nine-figure brands create video ads at a low cost without expensive agencies by using a simple video ad formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This approach, developed by Manson, previously growth at Common Cash App, helps run successful, profitable, and highly scalable Facebook ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This methodology, covering [[creative_strategy_and_testing_for_meta_ads | creative strategy and testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, focuses on a specific structure and script frameworks for [[improving_video_ad_performance | improving video ad performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Core Video Ad Formula: Hook, Body, CTA

The fundamental [[video_ad_creation_workflow | video ad creation workflow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> is structured as:
1.  **Hook** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>: Grabs attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
2.  **Body** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>: Conveys the main message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
3.  **Call to Action (CTA)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>: Instructs the viewer on the next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

This modular approach is recommended by Meta itself for distributing creative at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, 10 hooks, 10 bodies, and 3 CTAs can lead to 300 video ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Benefits of the Modular Approach

Adopting this [[creative_testing_structure_for_meta_ads | creative testing structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> offers several advantages:
*   **Easy Remixing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>: Video blocks are interchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Reduced Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>: No need to constantly pay for new content when existing elements can be reused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Double Down on Winners** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>: Allows remixing winning hooks, body videos, and CTAs for continued success and [[iterating_and_improving_meta_ads | iterating and improving Meta ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Why Video Ads Are Crucial

Video ads can be 13 times more incremental than static ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. While static ads might appear to perform similarly in Ads Manager or with last-click attribution, lift studies reveal the true impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

> [!example] Case Study: Javi Coffee
> House.io conducted a case study with Javi, a coffee company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. A Meta "bottom of funnel" campaign with only static ads was compared to a "top of funnel" campaign using "problem solution" video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The video ads were found to be 13 times more incremental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This incrementality is not visible in Ads Manager and requires a lift study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Hooks

The hook is the first part of your video and is critical for grabbing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Hooks can include:
*   **Visual hooks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   **Text hooks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   **Audio hooks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>

> [!example] True Classic Hooks
> True Classic tested different visual, text, and audio hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. They used two visual hooks and four text hooks, leading to eight hook variations, all feeding into the same body video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. By adding male and female voiceovers reading the text hooks, they doubled their variations to 16 hook variations leading into the same body video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Body: Script Frameworks

The body of the video ad communicates the core message. Here are four essential script frameworks for [[creating_video_ad_concepts | creating video ad concepts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>:

### 1. Problem-Solution
This framework starts by highlighting a problem, then introduces the product as the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Problem:** Identify the pain point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Plunge the knife and twist it:** Amplify the problem's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Introduce your product:** Present the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Optional additions:** Benefit (what they gain), social proof (who's getting results), and urgency (why act now) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
This framework is ideal for top-of-funnel campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### 2. Three Reasons Why Listicle
This highly effective framework, used by Common Cash App, allows for many variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   Present three key reasons why your product is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Variations:** Can be adapted to "three myths," "three benefits," or "five reasons why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Enhanced with testimonials:** Interject testimonials between each reason, ensuring the testimonial resonates with the preceding reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### 3. Testimonial Mashup
This framework focuses on social proof by chaining together multiple testimonials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   Combine short, impactful testimonials from different users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   Can feature user-generated content (UGC) or creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### 4. Basic Feature-Benefit
This framework pairs a product feature with its corresponding benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Feature one:** Describe an awesome aspect of your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Benefit one:** Explain why anyone should care about that feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Repeat for additional features and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Call to Action (CTA)

Video ads should end with a clear call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. While the hook and the first few seconds of the body are more critical (as average view duration is often around 5-6 seconds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, it's still beneficial to test different CTAs, especially with tools that make it easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

> [!example] True Classic CTAs
> True Classic provides examples of various call to action variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

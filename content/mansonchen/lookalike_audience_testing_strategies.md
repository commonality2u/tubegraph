Testing lookalike audiences is a valuable strategy for app founders and performance marketing leaders facing rising ad costs on Facebook, particularly when struggling with Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. While broad targeting is generally considered the bread and butter for scaling Facebook ad accounts, lookalikes can provide a necessary boost to efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Why Test Lookalikes?
Lookalike audiences can help reduce CAC by improving the quality of the audience, leading to higher conversion rates further down the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Although you might observe a higher cost per trial with lookalike audiences, this is typically balanced by a superior trial-to-subscribe rate, as the audience quality is inherently higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Seed Set Strategies
When testing lookalikes, it's beneficial to experiment with various seed sets beyond just "all customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Consider testing:
*   **Highest LTV (Lifetime Value) users** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Users with recent activity**: Users who have been most active within the last 30 or 90 days tend to provide excellent results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## List Size and Upload
For optimal performance, aim for a seed list size of at least 10,000 users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. While it's possible to go as low as 5,000, 10,000 is generally recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Once compiled, upload this list to Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Facebook typically achieves around a 70% match rate when processing these lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

User data for these seed lists can be pulled from analytics providers such as Mode Analytics, Amplitude, or PostHog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Integration with Broad Targeting
Lookalike audience strategies can be combined with broad targeting and other advanced strategies to significantly improve CAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

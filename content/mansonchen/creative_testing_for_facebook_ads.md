To scale Facebook ad spend profitably beyond $100,000 per month, a structured five-week creative testing roadmap can be followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This strategy is beneficial for companies struggling to increase Facebook ad spend without raising their Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The approach involves having a separate [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing campaign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Winning ads from this campaign are consistently moved to an Evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The methodology has shown success for subscription brands, helping them break through plateaus and scale significantly while decreasing CPA by 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Five-Week Creative Testing Roadmap

### Week 1: Message Testing

The message is considered the lowest-hanging fruit variable to test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Customer Research** Start by gathering customer research from sources like App Store reviews, testimonials, customer surveys, and interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Identify Key Insights** Use tools such as ChatGPT or Notebook LM by Google to surface top pains, problems, aspirations, and benefits experienced by customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Ad Formats** Transform these messages or short, snappy testimonials into low-fidelity static ad formats, such as whiteboard or post-it note designs, which are low-effort but often outperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Homework**
    *   Develop at least four distinct "angles" for your message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. These angles can focus on making customers feel good/happy, saving time or money, reducing stress, self-improvement, celebrating a holiday (seasonality), or creating controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    *   Create these for static, low-fidelity formats to test messages cost-effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   Maintain a consistent format (e.g., all whiteboard or all post-it note) to avoid introducing additional variables during testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
    *   Run these tests in your [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing campaign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
    *   Move winning ads to your Evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Week 2: Concept Testing

A "concept" is defined as any high-level visual distinction in an ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Distinction** Background colors, headlines, or aspect ratios are not considered new concepts; they are iterations to be covered in later weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Types of Concepts** You can have multiple image, video, and carousel concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Examples include: whiteboard, handwriting, founder story, text overlay/waterfall, oddly satisfying split frame, and Hi-Fi static concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Homework**
    *   Create four different concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   Use the best-performing message from Week 1 to keep the message consistent during concept testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
    *   Test two different image concepts and two different video concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
    *   Seek inspiration from trending organic content, competitors, or adjacent companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   Identify your top concepts (those with the lowest CAC or highest spend) to carry into Week 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Week 3: Script Testing

A "script" refers to the sales copy or voiceover within a video ad, or the text on an image ad, that converts a prospect into a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Foundation** Scripts should be based on the winning pain point or message identified in Week 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Script Frameworks** Three simple yet effective script frameworks include:
    *   **Problem-Solution**: Starts with a text hook, presents the problem, offers a solution, explains onboarding, details benefits, and ends with a call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   **Differentiator**: Begins with a hook, polarizes the solution, highlights a unique mechanism, introduces the product, lists benefits, includes social proof (results/testimonials), and concludes with a call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
    *   **Pain Point**: Uses a text hook, describes the problem, agitates the problem, introduces the product, differentiates it, outlines benefits, provides social proof, and finishes with a call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Infinite Combinations** These frameworks allow for an infinite number of variations by changing text hooks, problem presentations, polarization methods, calls to action, benefits, or social proof elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Homework**
    *   Select two different script frameworks for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
    *   Use the lowest CAC video ad concept identified from Week 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
    *   For each chosen script framework, create four different text hook variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   Test two adsets (one for each script framework), each containing four hook variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
    *   Launch these and identify which variants have the lowest CAC and highest spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Week 4: Visual Hooks

Visual hooks are visually engaging clips, typically lasting around 3 seconds, used to open a video ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness** They are highly effective at increasing the hook rate, which improves the overall performance of a video ad as more people watch it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **AI Generation** AI tools can quickly generate visual hooks, such as Sovereign.ai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Examples** Examples include: AI dog visual hooks, viral cat clips, toilet paper with handwriting/text overlay, and green screen UGC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Homework**
    *   Film new visual hooks, generate them with AI, or brief a creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Briefing a creator is often the most flexible, cheapest, and fastest option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
    *   Test these new visual hooks with the best video ad iterations from Week 3 (those with the lowest CAC or highest spend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
    *   Ensure all other elements (e.g., text hook, sales script body) remain consistent to isolate the impact of the visual hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### Week 5: Iterations

Iterations involve refining existing winning video ads or those close to your CAC goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Duration Adjustments** Increase or decrease the duration of your winning video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Pacing Adjustments**
    *   For older demographics, consider decreasing the pace by increasing the time messages are displayed on screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
    *   For younger demographics (Gen Z), aim for a quick, snappy pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Creator Iterations** If you have a winning video ad concept (e.g., a founder story), iterate by using an internal creator (e.g., someone from your social marketing team) or hiring an external creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Scene Reordering** Reorder the scenes within the ad's timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

After completing the five weeks, you can continuously repeat the testing process from any week (e.g., continue testing messages, low-fidelity concepts, or scripts) to maintain results and further optimize your [[facebook_creative_testing_strategies | Facebook creative testing strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

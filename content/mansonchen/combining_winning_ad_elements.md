As ad performance declines, advertisers often struggle to [[testing_and_iteration_for_successful_ads | test]] new ads before their Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) becomes too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Facebook studies indicate a 60% drop in conversion rate after just four repeated exposures to an ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. To combat this ad fatigue and scale profitable ad spend, several techniques can be employed to [[iterating_on_winning_video_ads_on_meta | refresh]] and [[iterating_on_winning_video_ads_on_meta | iterate]] on winning ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Hook Swapping

Once a successful combination of hook, body, Call to Action (CTA), and music is identified, new hooks can be swapped onto that existing combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Since the body and CTA are known to work, testing new hooks can attract new incremental audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The hook acts as the targeting mechanism, allowing advertisers to maximize the potential of a winning [[creating_video_ad_concepts | ad concept]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. For example, the Simple Intermittent Fasting app successfully [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | tested]] 16 different [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | visual hooks]] leading into the same User-Generated Content (UGC) testimonial ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

This strategy, often referred to as [[modular_creative_strategy_for_video_ads | modular creative]] at scale, is recommended by Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Given that 50% of ads don't last more than two days on Facebook, volume in [[creating_video_ad_concepts | ad creation]] and [[iterative_testing_process_to_find_winning_ads | iterative testing process]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Tools like Sovereign.ai can automate the combination of assets into hook-body-CTA structures for efficient [[testing_and_iteration_for_successful_ads | testing]] and scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Substitute

Another technique involves transforming a winning ad into a wildly different format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This means taking an existing successful ad and creating more variations of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Examples include:
*   Converting a winning static ad into a [[elements_of_image_and_video_ads | video ad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   Turning a winning [[elements_of_image_and_video_ads | video ad]] into a static ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Transforming static ads into a new carousel ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

The key is to maintain the ad's core "winning trait" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This trait could be the creator, the script, the imagery, or the editing style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. These variations help increase ad volume and [[creative_diversity_in_ad_strategies | creative diversity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Combination

The "combination" technique involves merging elements from two or three different winning ads to create an entirely new ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This is analogous to alloying in chemistry, where combining two metals creates a stronger, new metal, such as tin and copper forming bronze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Case Study: Men's Mental Health App
A practical example of this technique comes from a men's mental health app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Analysis showed that two distinct elements performed exceptionally well:
*   Imagery featuring sharks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Angles employing a skeptical point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

By combining these two winning elements, the team created a new ad that became their top performer for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This ad featured a heavy text overlay with a skeptical [[creating_effective_ad_messages_and_concepts | message]] superimposed over a shark image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This demonstrates how combining successful [[elements_of_image_and_video_ads | imagery]] with [[creating_effective_ad_messages_and_concepts | effective ad messages and concepts]] can yield powerful new creatives.

To implement these strategies, focus on the top 25% of ads that have the lowest CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) and highest spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. By creating batches of these [[iterating_on_winning_video_ads_on_meta | iterations]], advertisers can continuously refresh their campaigns and scale effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

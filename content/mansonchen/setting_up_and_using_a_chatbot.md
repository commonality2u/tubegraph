A custom [[creating_a_chatbot_using_substack_posts | chatbot]] can be created using existing code and personal content sources, such as Substack posts, to provide real-time, relevant answers based on the user's information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This process is described as not being very difficult to set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Creation and Setup
The chatbot demonstrated was developed based on code initially created by Dan Shipper from Every <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The developer updated the code and utilized their own [[creating_a_chatbot_using_substack_posts | Substack posts]] as the knowledge base for the chatbot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Chatbot in Action
The chatbot answers questions in real-time, drawing information directly from the provided [[creating_a_chatbot_using_substack_posts | posts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Example Questions and Responses
1.  **"What are [[utilizing_ai_tools_for_marketing_and_content_creation | AI]]?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
    *   The chatbot processes this question and provides an answer based on its training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
2.  **"How quickly can you generate a [[automating_facebook_video_ads | video]] with Deforum?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>
    *   Deforum is an open-source [[utilizing_ai_tools_for_marketing_and_content_creation | AI]] [[automating_facebook_video_ads | video]] software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
    *   The chatbot correctly answers "15 minutes," a detail found in the developer's posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
3.  **"What can you do with ControlNet?"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
    *   ControlNet is another open-source image-to-image software built on Stable Diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    *   The chatbot responds that ControlNet allows users to generate images and [[automating_facebook_video_ads | videos]] with additional controls for poses or compositions from text images, again pulling this information from the developer's posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

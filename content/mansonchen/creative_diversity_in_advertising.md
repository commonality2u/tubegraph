While many discuss [[creative_diversity_in_ad_strategies | creative diversity]] in advertising, few demonstrate how to implement it effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept extends beyond just having different visual concepts for static and video ads; it crucially includes message diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The goal is to blend visual and message formats to discover the winning combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Message Diversity

Diversifying your message is essential and can be achieved by considering the buyer's journey and universal human motivators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Stages of Awareness

Messaging should be tailored to the customer's stage of awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>:
*   **Unaware people** They have no idea a problem exists or that your product exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Problem aware people** They know of the problem but not the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Solution aware people** They are aware of solutions but don't know your product exists to solve their problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Product aware people** They know about your product and competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Most aware people** They are aware of you but haven't purchased yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

For those just starting, it's recommended to begin with "bottom of funnel" messaging, such as customer testimonials, social proof, results, and case studies, then work your way up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Universal Human Motivators

These motivators can help brainstorm different angles for your ideal customer profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>:
*   Avoid effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   Save time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   Avoid mental or physical pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Increase comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   Improve health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
*   Improve status or luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   Feel love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>
*   Be praised and appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>

Consider how your product helps customers achieve these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Messaging Frameworks

## Starting Your Creative Testing

To begin [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]], look for the "lowest hanging fruit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>:
1.  **Competitor Analysis**: Examine your competitors' top concepts and messages for inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
2.  **Ad Comments**: Pay attention to comments on your own ads and competitors' ads to understand what resonates and identify universal human motivators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
3.  **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Demographics**: Adjust your ad formats based on your audience. For example, an older demographic might spend more time on Facebook feed than Instagram Reels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
4.  **Mirror Competitor Success**: If a competitor's top concepts are image ads, consider trying static ads yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Ultimately, strive for a healthy [[importance_of_creative_diversity | creative diversity]] mix of image ads, video ads, different messages, and script frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

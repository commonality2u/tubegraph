This article demonstrates a [[creating_a_chatbot_using_substack_posts | chatbot created]] by integrating blog posts from Substack with updated code based on a collaboration by Dan Shipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The purpose of this demonstration was to show the chatbot in action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Chatbot Functionality

The chatbot is designed to answer questions in real-time, drawing its information directly from the Substack posts it was trained on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Demonstration Questions

The video showcases the chatbot's capabilities by asking it specific questions:

*   **AI-Generated Video Generation Speed**
    *   **Question:** "How quickly can you generate a video with A.I. Form?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> (A.I. Form is an open-source [[ai_generated_video_content | AI video software]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>).
    *   **Answer:** The chatbot responded that it takes "15 minutes," a detail sourced directly from the creator's posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **ControlNet Capabilities**
    *   **Question:** "What can you do with ControlNet?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a> (ControlNet is an open-source text-to-image or image-to-image software built on Stable Diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>).
    *   **Answer:** The chatbot stated that with ControlNet, users can "generate images and videos with additional controls for poses or compositions for text-image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This information also came from the creator's posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This demonstrates its utility in [[using_aigenerated_content_in_video_ads | using AI-generated content in video ads]].

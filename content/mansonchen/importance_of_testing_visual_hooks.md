Many marketers struggle with iterating on winning video ads on Meta, often finding a successful ad but missing out on additional profit by not digging deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To maximize returns, it's crucial to aggressively and shamelessly test more [[importance_of_visual_hooks_in_video_ads | visual hooks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Why Test More Hooks?

Traditional marketing approaches often involve testing only three or four hooks, which doesn't guarantee finding the most effective hook for a given concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The initial moments of an ad are critical:
*   TikTok research indicates that 50% of ad recall occurs within the first two seconds, underscoring the short attention span of users, akin to goldfishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   New hooks are essential for targeting new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Case Study: The Simple Intermittent Fasting App

An 8-figure dating app, "The Simple Intermittent Fasting app," demonstrates the power of extensive [[importance_of_testing_hooks_for_video_ads | hook testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Estimated to make $47.8 million per year, they launched at least 20 ad variations using the same body video but with 20 different [[importance_of_visual_hooks_in_video_ads | visual hooks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. These variations were often launched on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This strategy is not unique to them; other mobile apps, including Calm, also employ this tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Many of their [[visual treatments and hooks in advertising | visual hooks]] are [[aigenerated_visual_hooks | AI generated]] and are paired with a single, high-performing text hook like "How to lose 40 lbs in one month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. A key insight is that [[visual and text hook variations | visual consistency]] from hook to body is less important than message consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## The Power of Variant Testing

Research by AppsFlyer found that only 2% of ad variants account for 68% of results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This means less than one out of 50 ad variants will scale successfully, and marketers can never be certain which ad will perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Extensive [[importance_of_testing_hooks_for_video_ads | hook testing]] helps to "flood the market with high floor ads," making them much less likely to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Think of it like basketball: Steph Curry, a Warriors fan favorite, doesn't drain every three-pointer, but he keeps shooting. Similarly, marketers need to "take more shots on goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Top mobile apps like Simple app, Rise Science, and Headway understand the importance of launching numerous ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Hook Swapping Strategy

Once a winning ad concept is identified, "hook swapping" is one of the most effective ways to iterate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This strategy is:
*   Low risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   Low effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   High reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>

It allows for testing new, diverse content without reinventing the entire ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This approach can be compared to Apple's iPhone strategy: they found a winning product and continue to innovate on it with new features (like better cameras, more storage, or new colors) which act as "new hooks" for each version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Conclusion

A leading utility app created over 1,600 video ads in three months by aggressively testing new hooks on winning video ad concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This maintained their win rate and saved 80% of their designer time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The Simple Intermittent Fasting app, for instance, tests at least 20 [[organizing visual hooks for ads | visual hooks]] on the same core winning body video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Implementing this tactic can lead to increased profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

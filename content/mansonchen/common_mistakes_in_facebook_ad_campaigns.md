Brands and agencies often make several common mistakes in their Facebook ad accounts that can hinder performance and waste budget. Addressing these issues is crucial for effective advertising.

## 1. Over-reliance on Funnel-Based Targeting
One common mistake is segmenting audiences into "top of funnel," "middle of funnel," and "bottom of funnel" categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

*   **Broad Targeting Efficiency**: Facebook's algorithms are adept at finding users most likely to convert through broad targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. They can automatically retarget individuals who have visited a landing page or viewed a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
*   **Retargeting and Incrementality Testing**: While retargeting ad sets might show lower cost per acquisition (CPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>, it's essential to perform incrementality testing. Without it, it's impossible to determine how many of those conversions would have occurred organically, leading to potentially wasted spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.

## 2. Under-Budgeting Ad Sets
Many ad sets are observed with daily budgets as low as $10, even when the cost per acquisition goal is $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

*   **Importance of Data Volume**: Ad sets require significant volume and data flow to optimize effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Facebook's learning phase aims for about 10 conversion events per week to gather sufficient data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   **Budget Constraint Issues**: Constraining ad sets with low daily budgets (e.g., $10) when the product or trial costs $50 will not yield good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## 3. Insufficient Creative Testing
A significant oversight is the lack of new [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creatives]] being tested within a three-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

*   **Ad Fatigue**: Ads naturally experience fatigue over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous Testing**: To maintain growth, especially at higher spending levels, new [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creatives]] should be tested monthly, or even weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. Increased ad spend accelerates ad fatigue, necessitating more frequent testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

## 4. Prioritizing Audience Testing Over Creative Testing
Some brands and agencies prioritize audience testing (e.g., lookalike audiences, interest stacks) with the same [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creatives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

*   **Creative as the New Targeting**: In 2024, [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creative]] is considered the new targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Cannibalization and Inefficiency**: Testing the same [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creative]] across different audiences can cannibalize efforts and reduce efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. It's more effective to focus on [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creative testing]] with broad targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. While interest or lookalike targeting might be useful when starting, broad targeting becomes optimal as campaigns [[scaling_facebook_ads | scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

## 5. Failure to Quality Assurance (QA) Optimization Events
A critical foundational mistake is not verifying whether optimization events are firing correctly on landing pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

*   **Foundational Check**: It's crucial to ensure that if an ad is optimized for a purchase, the purchase event correctly fires when a conversion occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **Preventing Wasted Spend**: Failing to QA these events means burning cash without accurate tracking, leading to ineffective campaign optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

Effective organization of ad campaigns and their associated assets is crucial for efficiency, especially when dealing with a high volume of ad variations. A platform feature allows users to categorize and manage different ad initiatives through "projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## What are Projects?

Projects serve as containers for grouping ad assets and campaigns based on specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. They are particularly useful for both performance creative agencies and in-house teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

### Use Cases for Projects
*   **Different Ad Concepts**: Create separate projects for distinct [[creating_video_ad_concepts | ad concept]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   **New Creators**: Isolate assets relevant to new creators within their own projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **Creative Testing Rounds**: Organize assets for specific [[creative_testing_structure_for_meta_ads | creative testing rounds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **Client Management (Agencies)**: Agencies can house different assets for various clients in dedicated projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Project Dashboard and Naming

Upon accessing the platform, users are presented with a project dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Projects can be named flexibly to suit organizational preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

Project naming conventions can include:
*   Client name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>
*   Creator name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>
*   [[creating_video_ad_concepts | Video ad concept]] name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>
*   [[creative_testing_structure_for_meta_ads | Creative round]] name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>

## Project Contents and Workflow

Within a project, users can find final video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a> and upload clips to create new video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. After creating new hooks with text overlays in bulk, these can be integrated back into existing projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. This allows for testing new hooks with winning body videos or new body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

When [[testing_video_ad_effectiveness_with_metrics | evaluating ad performance]] to understand which ads are performing best, it's important to choose the right metrics, especially when aiming for scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Pitfalls of Sorting by CPA

Sorting ads solely by Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) can be misleading, particularly when seeking to [[role_of_volume_in_ad_performance | scale]] ad campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. An ad with the lowest CPA might have minimal spend, potentially as low as six dollars or even zero, making it an unreliable indicator for broader investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Ad Score Custom Metric

To effectively rank ads and determine where to invest resources for [[improving_video_ad_performance | improving video ad performance]], a custom metric called "Ad Score" is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. While it can be named anything (e.g., "Purchase Score"), this metric provides a simple yet effective way to achieve 90% of the desired analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Creating the Ad Score

The "Ad Score" can be created as a custom metric within [[key_metrics_for_evaluating_creative_performance_in_facebook_ads | Facebook Ads Manager]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

The formula for Ad Score is:
> Purchases / Cost Per Purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

### How Ad Score Helps Analyze Performance

The "Ad Score" metric helps analyze and rank ads by considering both volume and cost-efficiency:
*   Ads with more purchases will achieve a higher score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Ads with a lower CPA will also achieve a higher score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   If two ads have the same CPA, the ad with more purchases will receive a higher score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

This approach helps to [[testing_strategies_for_successful_ads | easily rank ads]] against each other, guiding decisions on where to invest limited resources for [[improving_ad_performance_with_datadriven_strategies | improving ad performance with datadriven strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Creating winning video ads more quickly is a significant challenge for many advertisers. Traditional methods often involve inefficiencies, high costs, and a lack of agility in testing and iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Current Challenges in [[Creating performance video ads | Video Ad Creation]]

Advertisers frequently encounter several obstacles that hinder their ability to create and test video ads efficiently:

*   **Reliance on Agencies:** Using expensive agencies, sometimes paying a percentage of ad spend, can result in a focus on deliverables rather than actual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   **Internal & Outsource Talent Issues:** Internal designers may not understand direct response marketing, while outsourced talent can also present challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Manual Creation:** Manually creating video ads is prone to errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> and significantly increases the workload, especially when adapting to various aspect ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **"One-and-One Concepts":** A common pitfall is creating a single concept without variations or iterating based on performance data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Advertisers should iterate on working elements like hooks, selling frameworks, or scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Unused Content:** Valuable content and winning elements often sit unused, representing missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Long Feedback Cycles:** Relying on agencies or swamped editors leads to extended feedback cycles, delaying testing and optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Aspect Ratio Complexity:** Testing various aspect ratios (e.g., 1x1, 4x5, 16x9, 9x16) means creating four times more work and manual naming, which is error-prone and can skew data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

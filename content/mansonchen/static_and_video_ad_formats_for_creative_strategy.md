Effective advertising requires not only visual diversity in [[Static vs Video Ads in Facebook Advertising | static and video ads]] but also message diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The goal is to blend visual and message elements to create various combinations, ultimately identifying the most successful ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Mind maps can be a useful tool for understanding this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Message Diversity

Diversifying your ad messages is crucial, as not every customer is ready to buy immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Stages of Awareness (Buyer's Journey)

Message diversity can be based on the customer's stage in the buyer's journey or funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>:

*   **Unaware** People have no idea the problem or your product exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Problem Aware** Individuals understand the problem but not the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Solution Aware** They know about solutions but are unaware of your specific product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Product Aware** These people know about your product and competitors' products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Most Aware** They are aware of your product but haven't purchased yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

It's recommended to start with bottom-of-funnel messaging (e.g., customer testimonials, social proof, case studies) and then work your way up the funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Universal Human Motivators

These motivators can help brainstorm different angles for ideal customer profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>:

*   Avoiding effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
*   Saving time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   Avoiding mental or physical pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Increasing comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   Improving health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
*   Improving status or luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   Feeling love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>
*   Being praised and appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>

Consider how your product can help customers achieve these desires to generate numerous message ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

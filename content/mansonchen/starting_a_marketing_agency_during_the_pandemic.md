Alvin's journey into entrepreneurship and the establishment of his agency, Ads by Alvin, was significantly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. After years of working at major corporations like Upwork and Airbnb, where he felt there was a "ceiling" on his growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, the pandemic provided an unexpected opportunity for a new path.

## Background in Paid Social

Alvin has been involved in paid social marketing since approximately 2015, totaling about nine years in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. He initially started in paid search, focusing on Google, before quickly transitioning to paid social at Upwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. At Upwork, he was responsible for client acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> and began using Facebook ads for top-of-funnel scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. He recalls early Facebook ad rules, such as the now-removed 20% text limit on images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## The Impact of COVID-19 and the Leap to Entrepreneurship

Before starting his own venture, Alvin worked at Airbnb on the host acquisition team, managing global paid search for hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. In early 2020, he was working on an acquisition campaign for the Tokyo Olympics when the pandemic began to severely impact travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

As bookings plummeted, Airbnb's host acquisition team was laid off in May 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This event served as the catalyst for Alvin to immediately launch his own marketing agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Starting the agency was described as "a gift and a curse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The initial months were dedicated to building his reputation and acquiring clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. As a fellow entrepreneur, Alvin emphasizes the critical importance of maintaining a client pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

After four years, Ads by Alvin now boasts a "full roster of clients" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, highlighting the success achieved since its inception during a period of global uncertainty.

Effective creative strategy and growth in advertising often leverage a systematic approach to [[visual hooks and modular creative strategy | creative dimensions]], including [[visual and audio elements in advertising | visual treatments]] and hooks. Utilizing tools like mind maps can significantly aid in visualizing, organizing, and iterating on these elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This method helps identify what performs well, what doesn't, and what can be improved, ultimately leading to a higher creative win rate backed by data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Organizing Creative Dimensions

Creative dimensions can be categorized based on their proven performance to inform future ad creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>:

*   **Scalers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
    *   Elements that reliably scale a creative concept.
*   **What Works** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>
    *   Proven elements that consistently meet or exceed performance goals.
*   **Middle of the Road** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
    *   Variations that sometimes win and beat CPA goals, but are not always consistent.
*   **Don't Work** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
    *   Elements that are repeatedly tested but consistently fail to perform. It's beneficial to label these to avoid re-testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Currently Testing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>
    *   Elements undergoing active evaluation.
*   **Ideas Bucket** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>
    *   A repository for new concepts, including hooks, audio, [[visual treatments and hooks in advertising | visual treatments]], scripts, video formats, and static formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Creative Elements to Test

A diverse range of creative elements can be tested and tracked within these categories:

### Static Formats
These are various layouts or styles for static image ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>:
*   US versus Them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
*   Before/After <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
*   Post-it notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
*   Simple tweet style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
*   Apple notes style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>
*   WhatsApp conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   iMessage conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>

### Video Formats
These include various video ad structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>:
*   Before/After <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
*   US Versus Them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>
*   Founder story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>
*   User-Generated Content (UGC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>
*   [[ai_visual_concepts_in_advertising | AI UGC]] is a current trend that appears to perform comparably to regular, people-based UGC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Scripts
Different frameworks for ad copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>:
*   Listicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
*   Problem-Agitate-Solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>
*   Before/After Bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>
*   Feature-Advantage-Benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>

### [[visual treatments and hooks in advertising | Visual Treatments]]
These are specific visual effects or presentation styles applied to video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>:
*   **Split Frame Concept**: Similar to viral TikToks where a video game (e.g., Minecraft, Counter-Strike) is played on the bottom while a podcast clip runs on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Kaleidoscope Effect**: Adding a kaleidoscope effect to the [[visual hooks in video ads | visual hook]] of an ad can be a successful visual treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Hooks
[[Using visual hooks and iterations in ad campaigns | Hooks]] are the initial elements designed to grab attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. They can be further categorized:
*   **Text Hooks**: Phrases like "You in three months" or "Ever dreamed of playing your favorite songs?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **[[importance_of_visual_hooks_in_video_ads | Visual Hooks]]**: Visual elements designed to capture attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Audio Hooks**: Trending music or viral audio clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Iteration and Improvement

By continuously testing and categorizing these creative dimensions, advertisers gain a better understanding of what works, what doesn't, and what has the potential to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This allows for focused iteration on "middle of the road" elements to improve their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Combining well-performing elements, such as a strong hook (e.g., "Bust through a 20-year Plateau with a blue Post-it note") with a winning script type (e.g., "How to get better at Guitar" checklist) and a successful video format (e.g., a member or artist performance), can significantly increase the win rate of an ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This systematic approach provides conviction and clarity on what to test next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

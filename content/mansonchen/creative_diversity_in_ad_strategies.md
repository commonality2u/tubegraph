[[Creative diversity in advertising|Creative diversity]] in ad strategies is crucial for sustained performance, as it allows for the testing and optimization of various ad elements. Mind maps can be a game-changer for visualizing and managing this process, especially given the many dimensions available for testing within [[creative_strategy_and_growth|creative strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This approach helps in understanding what performs well, what doesn't, and where to iterate for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. By combining elements that have proven successful, marketers can achieve a higher [[creative_win_rate|creative win rate]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Creative Dimensions

The effectiveness of ad creative can be categorized into various performance dimensions:

### Performance Categories

*   **Scalers**
    *   Elements that reliably scale a creative concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **What Works**
    *   Proven elements that meet performance goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Middle of the Road**
    *   Variations where some perform well, beating Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) goals, while others do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. These are areas for potential iteration and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Don't Work**
    *   Elements, such as specific static or video formats, that consistently fail despite testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. It's important to label and track these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Currently Testing**
    *   Elements actively being evaluated for performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Ideas**
    *   A repository for new concepts, hooks, audio, visual treatments, and script ideas that can be tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Elements to Test

Ad creative can be broken down into numerous testable elements:

*   **Messaging Angles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Offer Scripts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   **Hooks**
    *   Includes text hooks (e.g., "You in three months," "Ever dreamed of playing your favorite songs?"), visual hooks, and audio hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Static Formats**
    *   Examples include "Us versus Them," "Before/After," Post-it notes, simple tweet style, Apple notes style, WhatsApp conversations, and iMessage conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Video Formats**
    *   Includes "Before/After," "Us Versus Them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   Founder stories and User-Generated Content (UGC), including AI-generated UGC, are also common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. AI-generated UGC is increasingly popular and performs comparably to human-based UGC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Scripts**
    *   Frameworks such as listicles, problem-agitate-solution, before-after bridge, and feature-advantage-benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Visual Treatments**
    *   Specific visual effects or layouts, such as the split-frame concept seen on TikTok (e.g., video game at the bottom, podcast clip at the top) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. An example is adding a kaleidoscope effect to a visual hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Audio**
    *   Trending music or viral audio hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Benefits of Creative Diversity

By consistently testing and organizing these [[creative_diversity_in_advertising|creative diversity]] dimensions, advertisers gain a better understanding of what works, what doesn't, and what scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This allows for continuous iteration and improvement of "middle of the road" concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. For example, combining a high-performing hook (e.g., "Bust through a 20-year Plateau") with a successful visual (e.g., a blue Post-it note) or a proven script and performance type (e.g., checklist script with an artist performance) can significantly increase the likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This systematic approach fosters conviction and provides clear direction for future [[creative testing in marketing campaigns|creative testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

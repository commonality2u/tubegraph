When running [[optimizing_meta_ad_campaigns_for_purchases | Facebook ads]], selecting the correct campaign type for different stages, such as creative testing and scaling, is crucial to avoid wasting budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This article discusses the campaign types and ad set settings that have been effectively used by B2C apps like Calm and Cash App, helping a subscription brand increase its monthly spend from $50K to $95K, and a nutrition app grow from $3K to $60K monthly on [[optimizing_meta_ad_campaigns_for_purchases | Facebook ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## The Problem with Advantage Shopping+ Campaigns for Creative Testing

A common and expensive mistake, especially for newer advertisers, is not knowing how to set up a [[testing_and_optimizing_ad_variations | creative testing campaign]] properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The [[optimizing_meta_ad_campaigns_for_purchases | Facebook algorithm]] operates on a "winner take all" principle, meaning one or two ads within an ad set will receive the majority of the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The **Advantage Shopping+ (ASC) campaign** type should be avoided for creative testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Uneven Spend Distribution:** If you upload 50 ads into an ASC campaign, typically only one out of the 50 will get most of the spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Algorithm Limitations:** While [[optimizing_meta_ad_campaigns_for_purchases | Facebook]] promises to find the winning ad, the algorithm is probabilistic and can make mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Having a large number of ads in one ad set increases the chance of it picking the wrong one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Misleading Early Metrics:** Early funnel metrics like click-through rate and view duration can significantly skew delivery, but they don't always lead to actual conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. For example, a clickbait ad might get high engagement but fail to convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Low Success Probability:** With 50 ads in an ad set, there's only approximately a 2% chance that [[optimizing_meta_ad_campaigns_for_purchases | Facebook]] will pick the most effective ad right away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Real-World Example
An adtech app founder running creative testing in an Advantage Shopping+ campaign initially saw a [[optimizing_for_purchases_and_trial_starts | cost per trial]] of $40-$50 from the first three ads getting spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. After pausing these, the fourth ad received spend and yielded a [[optimizing_for_purchases_and_trial_starts | cost per trial]] of $8, which was five to six times better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This illustrates the risk of relying on ASC for testing.

## The Recommended Solution: Adset Budget Optimization (ABO) Campaigns for Creative Testing

For [[testing_and_optimizing_ad_variations | creative testing]], an [[adset_based_optimization_versus_campaign_budget_optimization | adset budget optimization]] (ABO) campaign is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Controlled Budget Allocation:** In an ABO campaign, you manually choose the daily budget for each ad set within the campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Higher Success Probability:** If you have an ad set test with four ad variants, an ABO campaign offers a 25% chance that [[optimizing_meta_ad_campaigns_for_purchases | Facebook]] will pick the right one immediately, a significant improvement over ASC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Efficient Testing:** This setup allows for multiple rows of ad set tests in your [[testing_and_optimizing_ad_variations | creative testing campaign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. It enables quick and objective pausing of underperforming ads based on predefined triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. While it may lead to more upfront spend, it significantly increases the chances of finding the best-performing ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Recommended ABO Setup for Creative Testing:
*   **Targeting:** Test one country and one language (e.g., US in English) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Once a winning ad is found, it can be localized for other languages and moved into evergreen campaigns for respective countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Daily Budget:** Start each [[testing_and_optimizing_ad_variations | creative testing]] ad set with a daily budget of $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Bidding:** Use auto bidding without setting a specific value for cost per result goal or a bid cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Advantage Shopping+ Campaigns for Scaling

While not suitable for initial testing, the Advantage Shopping+ campaign type is ideal for a [[optimizing_and_scaling_facebook_ad_campaigns | scaling campaign]] setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Pre-Vetted Ads:** In a [[optimizing_and_scaling_facebook_ad_campaigns | scaling campaign]], every ad in the ad set should have already proven its effectiveness in the [[testing_and_optimizing_ad_variations | creative testing campaign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Guaranteed Performance:** Because ads are pre-vetted, it doesn't matter which one [[optimizing_meta_ad_campaigns_for_purchases | Facebook]] chooses to spend on, as you can be confident it will have a low [[optimizing_facebook_ads_for_better_cost_per_acquisition | Cost Per Acquisition]] (CPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Fatigue Management:** If a winning ad starts to fatigue, you can pause it and allow another proven ad to take its place and receive spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

In summary, use [[adset_based_optimization_versus_campaign_budget_optimization | adset budget optimization]] campaigns for initial creative testing to control spending and objectively identify winning ads, and reserve Advantage Shopping+ campaigns for [[scaling_ad_spend_on_facebook | scaling]] proven creatives.

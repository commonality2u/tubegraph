A workflow for [[automatic_video_ad_creation | automatic video ad creation]] aims to help users scale Meta ad accounts profitably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This process involves a [[tools_for_automating_video_ad_creation | tool]] that automates the performance video creation flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It combines various video elements like hooks, body videos, call-to-action clips, and music to generate all possible variations for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Users can review these assets, set naming conventions, and quickly download the resulting video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## [[Video Ad Generation Process | Video Ad Generation Process]]

The [[video_ad_generation_process | video ad generation process]] described is a five-step procedure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>:

### 1. Upload Building Blocks
Users upload their "hooks" into a designated building block bucket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> and call-to-action (CTA) end cards are also uploaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Additionally, audio files, including music or voiceovers, can be uploaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This step aligns with a [[modular_approach_to_video_ad_creation | modular approach to video ad creation]] by preparing individual components.

### 2. Select Components
Users select the hooks they want to combine with their body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The tool allows selecting multiple hooks, for example, six hooks at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### 3. Adjust Settings
For selected clips, users can click a gear icon to:
*   Trim the clips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   Adjust volume levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
These adjustments can be applied to hooks, body videos, call to actions, and audio files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### 4. Choose Aspect Ratio
Users choose the final aspect ratio for the export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, such as 9x16 for Instagram stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### 5. Review and Finalize
After selecting components and settings, users proceed to a review screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Here, further adjustments can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

#### Naming Convention
A crucial step for performance marketers is setting the final naming convention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This is vital for tracking and isolating variables being tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, ensuring effective analysis of different ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The tool provides predetermined dropdown selections for elements like CTA name, body name, audio name, and aspect ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Users can also add custom fields to track every variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

#### Generation and Download
The tool displays the number of combinations that will be made and the credits deducted from the user's plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Upon hitting "create video ads," the videos are generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, whether hundreds or dozens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The generated ads appear within a few minutes, ready for download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This demonstrates how [[automating_video_ad_creation_with_sovran | automating video ad creation with Sovran]] streamlines the process.

Creating [[aigenerated_visual_hooks | AI-generated visual hooks]] involves a multi-step process utilizing various online tools to generate images and convert them into video clips for advertising purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Process for [[generating_visual_hooks_for_creatives | Generating Visual Hooks for Creatives]]

1.  **Find Inspiration on Lexica.art**
    *   Begin by visiting Lexica.art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
    *   Scroll through various image visuals to gather inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
    *   The platform allows users to copy the prompts used to generate the images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

2.  **Generate Images with AI Tools**
    *   Take the copied prompt, or create your own, and use an AI image generation website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Recommended tools include:
        *   Midjourney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>
        *   DALL-E 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>
        *   Stable Diffusion XL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
    *   Generate multiple images and select the one you prefer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

3.  **Convert Images to Video using Runway ML Gen-2**
    *   Navigate to Runway ML.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
    *   Utilize their Gen-2 model to transform your chosen image into a video clip using AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

4.  **Apply Effects and Transitions**
    *   Once the video is generated, apply custom effects and transitions to the approximately 4-second clip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This finalizes the [[visual_hooks_in_video_ads | visual hook]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Testing and Performance

After creating the [[visual_treatments_and_hooks_in_advertising | visual hook]], it's crucial to test its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. A strong hook rate is considered to be 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

To achieve significant success with Facebook ads, such as making millions of dollars, it's crucial to observe companies like Loop, BetterMe, and Headway. These companies consistently test hundreds, or even thousands, of ads each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The speaker, with experience managing over $100 million in profitable Facebook ad spend and personally [[testing_tens_of_thousands_of_ads | testing tens of thousands of ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, emphasizes that there are "invisible traits" of highly successful creative teams that can be copied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This advice applies to app founders, e-commerce founders, and new marketers alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The Mindset: Embracing a Testing-First Culture

Many mistakenly believe that the success of companies like BetterMe stems from having large marketing teams, pixel-perfect designs, or insane branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. However, the true foundation of success lies in a specific culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. This culture understands a fundamental truth: customers care more about themselves than about a brand's colors, fonts, or mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

### Encourage Wild Ideas and Data-Driven Decisions
Putting too many "guard rails" on creativity can stifle it, yet creativity is essential for finding great ideas and discovering what truly resonates with an audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. It's vital to create an environment where wild ideas are encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>. Average content, which AI tools like ChatGPT can generate, is often ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. Humans remain superior at producing innovative, wild ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

Crucially, subjective opinions from "gatekeepers" on which performance creative is "good to run" are unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. For performance marketers, the data should be the ultimate decider of whether an ad works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">[03:02:02]</a>. Even experienced marketers often find their personal predictions about ad performance to be incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:10">[03:08:10]</a>. Therefore, adopting a [[testing_first_culture | testing-first culture]] for performance creative is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

## Starting Experimentation: Core Message and Statics

The starting point for experimentation is simpler than many make it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

### Nail the Core Message First
Begin by starting small and nailing your core message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Many get too caught up in an ad's appearance, but the message itself impacts approximately two-thirds to three-quarters of ad performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. It's important to avoid being too clever; instead, be clear and concise, as confusion will lead users to scroll past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Focus on crafting compelling copy that grabs attention and resonates with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

### Master Statics Before Video
Before moving to video ads, it's advisable to get proficient with static ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Static ads are cheap, fast, and easy to create and test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Examples include simple post-it note ads, screenshots of text from Apple Notes, or even pictures of printed paper pasted onto someone's back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

Video ads are far more complex, involving elements like low-fi/hi-fi production, creative briefs, video editors, and multiple dimensions such as duration, pacing, script, problem/solution statements, and various hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. Mastering static ads and nailing the core message first simplifies the transition to video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

## Iterating and Doubling Down on What Works

A major mistake is ignoring signals from ad performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

### Categorizing Ads for Iteration
Focus on [[doubling_down_on_what_works | doubling down on ads]] that are performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. Ads can be categorized into a simple red, yellow, and green system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>:
*   **Red Ads**: Have a cost per acquisition (CPA) that is too high and unlikely to reach the CPA goal, even with iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.
*   **Yellow Ads**: Are close to the CPA goal, typically within 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. A new concept might require up to three rounds of [[iterative_testing_process_to_find_winning_ads | iteration]] to become a winning ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.
*   **Green Ads**: Are scaling in evergreen campaigns or have passed the [[creative_testing_campaign | creative testing campaign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. These ads contain winning elements and are ripe for continued iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. At least half of all ad efforts should be focused on iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

### Iteration Strategies for Video Ads
For video ads, effective iteration strategies include:
*   **Remixing Video Blocks**: Video ads typically follow a structure: hook, body (main content), and call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.
    *   If a winning hook with a high hook rate (e.g., above 30%) isn't performing, test that same hook with new body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.
    *   If a body video has a high hold rate but isn't converting, test different hooks with it to potentially engage new audience segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.
*   **Testing Winning Scripts with New Creators**: If a script is performing well but [[testing_and_iterating_ad_concepts | iterating]] with the same creator isn't yielding better results, try the same script with different creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. This approach has consistently led to new winning ad variations that scale as effectively, or even more effectively, than the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.

Once a testing-first philosophy is adopted and data starts accumulating, the next step is to analyze the Facebook [[creative_testing_data | creative testing data]], focusing on key metrics to confidently scale winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. This can be done using Facebook's ad reporting dashboard for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

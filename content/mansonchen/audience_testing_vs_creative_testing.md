When managing Facebook ad accounts, a common mistake observed is the prioritization of audience testing over [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:17">[02:46:17]</a>. This approach often involves testing the same creative across different audiences, such as [[lookalike_audience_testing_strategies | lookalike audiences]] or interest stacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:03">[02:49:03]</a>.

## Creative is the New Targeting

In 2024, the emphasis has shifted: "creative is the new targeting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:23">[03:00:23]</a>. Relying solely on audience testing without continuously testing new creatives can lead to cannibalization of efforts and inefficient spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## Why Creative Testing is Preferred

Instead of audience testing, it is recommended to prioritize [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creative testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. This involves:

*   **Counteracting Ad Fatigue**: Ads will naturally fatigue over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. Brands, especially those with high ad spend, need to test new creatives monthly or even weekly to sustain growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. As spending increases, ad fatigue accelerates, necessitating more frequent testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. This aligns with [[frequency_of_creative_testing_in_ads | testing and iterating ad concepts]] constantly.
*   **Leveraging Broad Targeting**: For those just starting out, interest targeting and [[lookalike_audience_testing_strategies | lookalike targeting]] might be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. However, as ad spend scales, unlocking broad targeting becomes more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. Broad targeting allows Facebook's algorithm to automatically find the most likely converters, including retargeting those who visited a landing page or viewed a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

Prioritizing [[creative_testing_in_facebook_ads | creative testing]] over audience testing ensures more effective ad spend and better performance over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

A common mistake observed in Facebook ad accounts involves setting ad set daily budgets too low, particularly when the [[cpa_and_scaling_ads | CPA]] (cost per acquisition) goal is significantly higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For example, using a $10 daily budget when a product or subscription costs $50 or more for a trial or purchase is ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Impact of Insufficient Budgeting

Ad sets require a significant volume of data to perform optimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This principle is aligned with Facebook's learning phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, which aims to gather enough data for ad delivery optimization. While the previous guideline was 50 conversions per week, the current recommendation is 10 conversion events per week for an ad set to exit the learning phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Constraining an ad set with a low daily budget directly limits the data flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. If the daily budget is less than the cost of a single conversion, it becomes extremely difficult for the ad set to exit the learning phase or gather enough relevant data to efficiently find converting customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid setting ad set daily budgets that are too low relative to your [[cpa_and_scaling_ads | CPA]] goal, as this will prevent your ad sets from gathering sufficient data and optimizing effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Ensure your budget allows for enough conversion events to flow into each ad set weekly, especially when [[optimizing_meta_ad_campaigns_for_purchases | optimizing for a purchase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## The Five Stages of Awareness

The customer journey can be broken down into five distinct stages of awareness, moving from the "top of funnel" to the "bottom of funnel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>:

*   **Unaware People** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
    *   These individuals have no idea that a problem exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
    *   They are unaware of your product or even your existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

*   **Problem Aware People** <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
    *   They recognize that they have a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
    *   However, they are not yet aware of potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

*   **Solution Aware People** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>
    *   These individuals are aware that solutions exist for their problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.
    *   They do not know that your specific product, or similar products, exist to solve their problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.

*   **Product Aware People** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>
    *   They are aware of your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.
    *   They may also be aware of different competitor products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>.

*   **Most Aware People** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>
    *   They are fully aware of your brand and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>.
    *   They simply have not yet made a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>.

## Applying Awareness Stages to Messaging

To effectively [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | diversify your message]], it is important to tailor it to the specific part of the [[importance_of_broad_targeting_vs_funnel_stages | buyer journey]] the customer is in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.

If you are just starting out, it is recommended to begin with "bottom of funnel" messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>. This includes:
*   Customer testimonials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a>
*   Social proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>
*   Results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>
*   Case studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>

This guide outlines a five-week [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing roadmap]] to help scale Facebook ad spend profitably beyond $100,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It's particularly useful for those struggling to scale Facebook ad spend without increasing Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The strategies presented have helped brands significantly increase ad spend while decreasing CPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## General Considerations for Ad Testing

To ensure effective [[testing_strategies_for_successful_ads | testing]], it's recommended to have a separate [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing campaign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Winning ads from this campaign should always be moved to an Evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Week 1: Message Testing

The message is considered the "lowest hanging fruit variable" to test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

### Crafting Effective Messages
*   **Customer Research:** Start by analyzing customer research, including App Store reviews, testimonials, customer surveys, and interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Use tools like ChatGPT or NotebookLM to surface top pains, problems, aspirations, and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Low-Fidelity Formats:** Incorporate these messages or short, snappy testimonials into low-fidelity static ad formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Examples include:
    *   Whiteboard formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>
    *   Post-it note formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>
    These low-effort, low-fidelity formats often outperform more polished ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

### Homework for Week 1
*   Develop at least four different "angles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. Angles can focus on making customers:
    *   Feel good or happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>
    *   Save time or money, or make more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>
    *   Reduce stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>
    *   Improve themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>
    *   Celebrate a holiday (seasonality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>
    *   Create controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>
*   Create four static, low-fidelity ad formats to test these messages cost-effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   Keep the ad format consistent to avoid additional variables, e.g., test four different messages using only the whiteboard format or only the post-it format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   Run these in your [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing campaign]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Winning ads should be moved to your Evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

## Week 2: Concept Testing

A "concept" is defined as any high-level visual distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. Background colors, headlines, or aspect ratios are considered iterations, not new concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

### Examples of Ad Concepts
Concepts can include multiple image, video, and carousel formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Examples provided are:
*   Whiteboard concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>
*   Handwriting concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>
*   Founder story concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>
*   Text overlay/text waterfall concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>
*   Oddly satisfying split frame concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>
*   Hi-Fi static concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>

### Homework for Week 2
*   Create four different concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   Use the best message from Week 1 to keep the message consistent during [[creating_video_ad_concepts | concept testing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
*   Test two different image and two different video concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
*   Seek inspiration from trending organic content and competitor/adjacent company ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   Take the top concepts (lowest CAC or highest spend) to Week 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

## Week 3: Script Testing

A "script" is the sales copy or voiceover that runs throughout the length of a video ad, or the text on an image ad, converting a prospect into a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Scripts should be based on the winning pain point or message from Week 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

### Script Frameworks
Three simple but effective script frameworks are common in ads:
1.  **Problem-Solution Framework** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>:
    *   Text hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>
    *   Present your problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>
    *   Present your solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>
    *   Explain the onboarding process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>
    *   Talk about benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>
    *   End with a call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>
2.  **Differentiator Framework** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>:
    *   Hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>
    *   Polarize your solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>
    *   Talk about your unique mechanism/what differentiates your solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>
    *   Introduce your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>
    *   Go into benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>
    *   Social proof (results, testimonials) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>
    *   End with a call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>
3.  **Pain Point Framework** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>:
    *   Text hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>
    *   Talk about the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>
    *   Agitate the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>
    *   Introduce your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>
    *   Differentiate your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>
    *   Talk about the benefits of using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>
    *   Go into social proof (results, testimonials) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>
    *   End with a call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>

These frameworks allow for infinite combinations by varying hooks, problem presentations, polarizations, calls to action, benefits, and social proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

### Homework for Week 3
*   Pick two different script frameworks to test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
*   Use the lowest CAC video ad concept from the previous week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.
*   For each script framework, create four different text hook variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.
*   Test two different ad sets, one for each script framework, with four different hook variations in each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.
*   Launch and identify variants with the lowest CAC and highest spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

## Week 4: Visual Hooks

Visual hooks are visually engaging clips (usually around 3 seconds) that open a video ad and are highly effective at increasing the hook rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. [[ai_visual_concepts_in_advertising | AI can help generate these visual hooks quickly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.

### Examples of Visual Hooks
*   AI dog visual hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>
*   Viral cat visual hook (as seen in a "Better Me" ad) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>
*   Toilet paper with handwriting and text overlay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>
*   Green screen User-Generated Content (UGC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>

### Homework for Week 4
*   Film some visual hooks, generate them with AI, or brief a creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. Using AI or a creator is typically the most flexible, cheapest, and fastest option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.
*   Test these new visual hooks with the best video ad iterations (lowest CAC or highest spend) from the previous week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.
*   Keep all other variables consistent, including the text hook and the sales script/body of the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.

## Week 5: Iterations and Continuous Testing

After establishing winning messages, concepts, scripts, and visual hooks, the focus shifts to [[testing_and_iterating_ad_concepts | iterating]] on successful ads to optimize performance further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>.

### Types of Iterations
*   **Duration/Pace:** Increase or decrease the duration of winning video ads or ads close to the CAC goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. Adjust the pace:
    *   For older demographics, try decreasing the pace (increasing the time messages are on screen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.
    *   For younger (Gen Z) demographics, aim for a quick, snappy pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.
*   **Creator Variations:** If a video ad concept with a founder story is winning, iterate with an internal creator (e.g., from the social marketing team) or hire another creator to replicate the success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.
*   **Scene Reordering:** Reorder the scenes within the video ad's timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.

### Continuous Improvement
The [[creative_strategy_and_testing_for_meta_ads | creative strategy and testing]] process should be continuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. Do not stop testing messages, low-fidelity concepts, or scripts just because a particular week's "homework" is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. Keep applying the learned principles to consistently test and improve ad performance.

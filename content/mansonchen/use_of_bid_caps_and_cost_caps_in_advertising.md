Bid caps and cost caps are strategies used in advertising to control spending and optimize for desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:19">[03:58:19]</a>. They are particularly recommended for use in evergreen [[adset_budget_optimization_vs_advantage_shopping_campaigns|broad targeting]] campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:46">[04:00:46]</a>. It's important to note that advertisers may not achieve the optimal value on the first attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:39">[04:05:39]</a>.

## Setting Initial Values

*   **Cost Caps**: It is recommended to start a cost cap at approximately 130% of the target Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:48">[04:10:48]</a>. For example, if the goal CPA is $100, the initial cost cap should be set at $130 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:32">[04:16:32]</a>.
*   **Bid Caps**: For bid caps, it is suggested to start even higher than the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:42">[04:22:42]</a>.

The rationale for starting with higher caps is to facilitate immediate data acquisition and ad delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:819">[04:27:819]</a>. The associated risk can be managed by pairing these higher caps with a lower starting daily budget on the [[budget_allocation_for_ad_sets|ad set]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:369">[04:34:369]</a>.

## Risk Assessment

The risk associated with using bid caps and cost caps on [[adset_based_optimization_versus_campaign_budget_optimization|ad sets]] is considered low, especially when they are populated with creatives that have already met specific testing criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:0">[04:44:0]</a>. This allows for an aggressive approach to spending with bid caps and cost caps on these ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:999">[04:54:999]</a>.

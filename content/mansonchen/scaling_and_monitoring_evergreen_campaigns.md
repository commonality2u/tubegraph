[[scaling_facebook_ads | Scaling Facebook Ads]] involves a systematic approach, especially when transitioning successful creatives into evergreen campaigns. This process includes careful consolidation and ongoing monitoring to ensure sustained performance.

## Transitioning Winning Ads to Evergreen Campaigns

Winning creatives from testing campaigns can be scaled in an evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Ads that meet or are close to your KPI goals (green and yellow in a traffic light system) are candidates for iteration and then for your evergreen campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### Consolidating Post IDs

A crucial, yet often overlooked, part of ad account consolidation for evergreen campaigns is consolidating post IDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
To do this:
1.  Obtain the post ID from the winning ad within the creative testing campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
2.  Duplicate this ad using its post ID into your evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

Evergreen campaigns can utilize campaign types like Advantage Shopping+ or [[adset_based_optimization_versus_campaign_budget_optimization | Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

## Monitoring Evergreen Campaigns

Regular monitoring is essential for [[optimizing_and_scaling_facebook_ad_campaigns | optimizing and scaling Facebook ad campaigns]].

### Monitoring Frequency
Evergreen campaigns should be monitored frequently, ideally every week, or even every couple of days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. However, daily changes are typically not necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Key Monitoring Actions
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor the performance of your top ads for signs of fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Ad Elimination:** Cut underperforming ads ("decade ads") before their Cost Per Acquisition (CAC) becomes too expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Triggers:** Consider implementing automated triggers to manage ad performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   **Bids and Budgets:** Adjust bids and budgets weekly, or every three to five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Rolling Averages:** Review 7-day rolling averages for performance at the ad, adset, and campaign levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   **Exclusions:** Implement exclusions using dynamic and static lists to prevent targeting existing users in prospecting (user acquisition) campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

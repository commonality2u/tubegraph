A specialized mind map has been developed as a method to identify how to raise the expected value of every new ad tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This system is based on experience gained from creating tens of thousands of ads that have profitably spent tens of millions on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It is particularly useful for those who are [[creative_testing_structure_for_meta_ads | testing a lot of new ads]] but are not achieving significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Why a Mind Map for Ad Elements?

The mind map provides a visual way to organize and understand the various elements that comprise static and video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, allowing for the cataloging of their qualitative attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This approach helps advertisers understand why ads work over time by connecting hypotheses and ad tests with data and ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. By doing so, it clarifies why ads are scaling, enabling the creation of more successful ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### The Importance of Creative Volume

*   Some ad concepts have a smaller market and may fatigue quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   Meta's research indicates that half of ads will become ineffective within 48 hours, and only 2% last longer than 35 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   AppsFlyer found that 2% of ads account for 50% of ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   A high volume of diverse ad concepts is crucial ("a lot of shots on goal") to consistently feed the ad ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Structure of the Ad Element Mind Map

The mind map categorizes ad elements into different "buckets" to provide a clear overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. These buckets are similar to a traffic light system for ad performance:

*   **Scalers / Unicorn Ads:** Ads that are performing exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Working Ads (Green):** Ads that are hitting your Cost Per Acquisition (CAC) goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Middle of the Road / Kind of Working Ads (Yellow):** Ads that are approximately 1.25 times your CAC goal, with this ratio varying based on risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Not Working Ads (Red):** Ads that are above 1.5 times your CAC goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Ideas / Things to Test:** New concepts or elements for future testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

Within each performance bucket, ad elements are further divided into categories:

*   **Static Formats** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
    *   *Examples:* Notebook, writing a note on a wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Video Formats** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
    *   *Examples:* Skits, podcast-style video ads, B-roll mashups, testimonial mashups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Scripts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
    *   *Examples:* Problem-agitate-solution, POV text wall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Visual Treatments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
    *   *Examples:* Kaleidoscope effect, split frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Hooks** (visual hooks or text hooks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Audio** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
    *   *Example:* Trending music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Iteration Strategy

It can take up to three rounds of [[creative_testing_structure_for_meta_ads | iteration]] to turn a new concept into a winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. When a new ad concept isn't performing, it is expected to iterate on it two times to decrease the CAC over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. A recommended approach is to begin with a 50/50 blend of new concepts and [[creative_testing_structure_for_meta_ads | iterations]] to balance exploring new ideas with exploiting winning ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This strategy helps avoid burning out a concept from excessive iteration while mitigating the risks associated with [[creative_testing_structure_for_meta_ads | testing a lot of new concepts]] and variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Benefits of Using the Mind Map

By using this mind map, advertisers can build a comprehensive library of all tested ad elementsâ€”those that didn't work, those that worked somewhat, and those that worked exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The goal is to consistently do more of what's working and less of what isn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This disciplined approach helps maintain a high [[creative_testing_framework_for_meta_ads | creative win rate]] even as the volume of tested ads increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

The mind map can be freely accessed and duplicated from the video description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

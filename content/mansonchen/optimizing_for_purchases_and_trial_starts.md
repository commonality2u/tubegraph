When running Facebook ad campaigns, it is crucial to optimize for events that directly correlate with revenue growth. The primary objective should be to optimize for the [[optimizing_meta_ad_campaigns_for_purchases | purchase]] or [[qualified_trial_events_for_app_optimization | trial start]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Signal Impact vs. Signal Volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>

There is a trade-off between signal impact and signal volume when choosing your optimization event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. While optimizing for higher funnel objectives like an install or registration can incrementally reach new audiences, it is generally harder to execute correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

To successfully optimize for higher funnel objectives, robust measurement systems must be in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Otherwise, it is strongly recommended to begin by optimizing for the [[optimizing_meta_ad_campaigns_for_purchases | purchase]] or [[qualified_trial_events_for_app_optimization | trial start]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Ensuring High-Quality Trial Starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

If optimizing for a [[qualified_trial_events_for_app_optimization | trial start]], it is essential to ensure these trials are of high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This involves passing signals to Facebook that indicate the high quality of these trial starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

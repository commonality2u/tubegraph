Most [[optimizing_meta_ad_campaigns_for_purchases | Meta ads]] campaigns face significant challenges, with 90% of ads potentially failing without a specific approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To overcome this, a method has been developed to increase the expected value of every new ad tested, drawing from experience creating tens of thousands of ads that have profitably spent tens of millions on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This approach is particularly beneficial for advertisers testing many new ads but not achieving significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Ad Iteration Strategy and the Traffic Light System

A core strategy for [[iterating_and_improving_meta_ads | iterating on ads]] involves categorizing ads using a traffic light system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>:
*   **Green Ads**: Ads that are hitting the target Cost Per Acquisition (CAC) goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Yellow Ads**: Ads performing at approximately 1.25x the CAC goal. This threshold can be adjusted based on an advertiser's risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Red Ads**: Ads performing above 1.5x the CAC goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

It can take up to three rounds of [[iterating_and_improving_meta_ads | iteration]] to transform a new ad concept into a winning one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. When a new ad concept isn't performing well, advertisers should expect to [[iterating_and_improving_meta_ads | iterate]] on it at least twice to reduce its CAC over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Balancing New Concepts and Iterations

To maintain a healthy ad ecosystem, it's recommended to start with a 50/50 blend of new concepts and iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This mix allows for:
*   **Exploration**: Discovering entirely new ad concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Exploitation**: Optimizing and scaling ads and concepts that are already performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

This balance prevents burnout of a concept from excessive [[iterating_and_improving_meta_ads | iteration]] while also mitigating the risks associated with testing too many new variables simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The goal is to [[iterating_and_improving_meta_ads | iterate]] on concepts by introducing ad elements that will increase the expected value of each new ad tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## The Importance of [[role_of_volume_in_ad_performance | Creative Volume]]

[[role_of_volume_in_ad_performance | Creative volume]] is crucial because some ad concepts have smaller market reach and can fatigue quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Research from Meta indicates that half of ads die within 48 hours, and only 2% last longer than 35 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Additionally, AppsFlyer found that 2% of ads account for 50% of ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. These statistics highlight the necessity of having a high volume of creative "shots on goal" to continuously feed ad campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Tools like Sovereign.ai aim to automate [[video_ad_formula_for_meta | video ads]] while allowing users to maintain [[importance_of_creative_diversity_in_advertising | creative control]], facilitating the scaling of [[video_ad_formula_for_meta | video ad]] [[role_of_volume_in_ad_performance | volume]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## The Creative Dimensions Mind Map

To help advertisers understand and manage ad elements, a mind map of [[importance_of_creative_diversity_in_advertising | creative]] dimensions can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This mind map catalogs the qualitative attributes of ads, allowing for hypothesis testing, ad experimentation, and data-driven feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. It helps advertisers understand why certain ads scale, enabling them to produce more successful creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

The mind map buckets ad concepts into categories similar to the traffic light system:
*   **Ideas**: New concepts to test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Testing**: Ads currently being evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Not Working**: Ads that have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Working**: Ads performing well (middle of the road) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Scaling (Unicorn Ads)**: Ads that are performing exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Within each bucket, [[importance_of_creative_diversity_in_advertising | creative]] dimensions are further categorized:
*   **Formats**:
    *   **Static**: Examples include notebook or wall notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
    *   **Video**: Examples include skits, podcast-style [[video_ad_formula_for_meta | video ads]], B-roll mashups, or testimonial mashups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Scripts**: Standard structures like problem-agitate-solution, or POV (Point of View) text walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Visual Treatments**: Effects such as kaleidoscope or split frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Hooks**: Visual or text hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Audio**: Trending music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

This systematic categorization helps in building a library of tested elementsâ€”those that worked, those that didn't, and those that worked exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. By continually doing more of what works and less of what doesn't, advertisers can scale the number of ads they test while maintaining a high creative win rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This prevents wasting ad spend on ineffective creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

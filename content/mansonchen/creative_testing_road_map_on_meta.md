This article outlines a [[Creative testing road map on Meta | creative testing road map]] designed to potentially lower your Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) by 30% in 30 days or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The creator, Manson, has a background in growth and creative strategy at companies like C and Cash App, previously ran a performance creative agency, and is currently developing a tool for direct response video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Who This Road Map Is For
This [[Creative testing road map on Meta | creative testing road map]] is intended for advertisers who <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>:
*   Are testing many creatives on Meta but not seeing a lower Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   Find that media buyer optimizations don't lower CAC, as creative is now considered the new targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Optimize creatives "into a hole" by not engaging in [[Creative testing strategies for Meta in 2024 | creative exploration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Don't know what to test or only test minor elements like color or headline changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   Are not hitting their CAC targets and need more content for ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   Are incurring significant opportunity costs (tens of thousands per month) due to an unclear understanding of what messaging and ad elements drive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   Are using a "spray and pray" approach with ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

The goal is to move from a "spray and pray" approach to a structured [[Creative testing in marketing campaigns | testing process]] to achieve profitable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Creative Testing Setup: The Framework
A recommended [[Creative Testing Framework for Meta Ads | framework]] involves separating a [[Creative testing structure for Meta ads | creative testing campaign]] from an Evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Campaign Structure
*   **Creative Testing Campaign**: This campaign contains ad sets where four different ad variations are tested per ad set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   Each ad variation should test only one single thing, with everything else remaining constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. For example, testing four different AI influencers with the same script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   Ads meeting your Key Performance Indicator (KPI) goal (e.g., cost per trial start, purchase) are moved into your Evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   Ads far from your CPA goal are cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
    *   Ads that are "almost there" can be iterated upon with new hooks, scripts, or visual concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This iteration process can continue indefinitely within the testing campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Specific Setup Details
*   **Audience**: Start with a broad audience in your target country (e.g., US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Optimization**: Optimize for your specific bottom-funnel KPI (e.g., purchase, install, lead, trial start) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Conversions**: Allow each ad to run until it achieves at least 20 conversions to get a good estimate of its CAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Spend Allocation**: Expect one ad to typically take up most of the spend, indicating better engagement and scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Pausing Ads**: Pause underperforming ads using automated triggers (e.g., pause if an ad spends $300 without a conversion) to save money and enable high-volume testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Moving Winning Ads**: Copy winning ads that meet performance goals into your Business as Usual (BAU) campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   Continue running the ad in the [[Creative testing in Facebook ads | creative testing campaign]] to avoid performance fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, you can pause the winning ad in the testing campaign for a cleaner account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Repeatability**: Repeat steps 2-4 at your desired tempo. A general rule of thumb is to allocate 10% to 20% of your overall paid ads budget to testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Alternative Frameworks
Other [[Creative Testing Framework for Meta Ads | creative testing frameworks]] exist, each with pros and cons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>:
*   Running a [[Creative testing campaign in a separate country | creative testing campaign in a separate country]] with lower costs (e.g., India, Philippines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   Testing with an upper-funnel objective first (e.g., view content, clicks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   Testing on different channels like TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   Launching new creatives directly into BAU campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

The main takeaway is to always follow a [[Principles of creative testing campaigns | framework]] and to construct creatives in a way that allows performance measurement of each element, ensuring each variation tests one single thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## 4-Week Creative Testing Road Map

### Week 1: Message Testing
Message testing is considered the "lowest hanging fruit" for [[Creative testing for Facebook ads | testing ads]] as messages are what convert prospects into customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Goal**: Nail down the most painful pain point your product alleviates by testing four different pain points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Control**: Use a simple static image concept as a control (e.g., a black and white fake tweet style) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This simple format can often outperform other ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Homework**:
    *   Come up with four (or up to 8, 12, or 16) different pain points for your messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
    *   Use a simple format like the fake tweet, Post-it note, or iPhone note app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   Test these ads and aim for up to 20 conversions per ad to get a good idea of their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### Week 2: Concept Testing
A "concept" is defined as any high-level visual distinction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Background colors, headlines, or aspect ratios are not considered new concepts but rather iterations (to be covered in Week 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Goal**: Test the winning pain point from Week 1 on different image, video, and carousel concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Inspiration**: Look at competitors' ads in the Facebook Ads Library or successful advertisers like Headway and Rise Superfoods for creative diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Homework**:
    *   Create four different concepts, keeping the message consistent for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
    *   Test two different image concepts and two different video concepts to determine which format performs best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
    *   Keep video ads shorter for now; longer videos and script testing will be covered in Week 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
    *   Run these ads in separate ad set tests, aiming for 20 conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Week 3: Script Testing
A "script" refers to the sales copy or voice-over that runs throughout the length of your video, converting prospects into customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Goal**: Iterate on a winning or promising video ad from Week 2 by testing different scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Frameworks**: Base scripts off the winning pain point from Week 1 and use proven copywriting frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>:
    *   **Problem-Solution**: Text hook, present problem, present solution, talk about onboarding/benefits, Call to Action (CTA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
    *   **Differentiator**: Text hook, polarize (most other solutions do X), talk about your unique mechanism, introduce product, benefits, social proof, CTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
    *   **Pain Point Script**: Text hook, present problem, agitate the solution, introduce product, differentiate product, benefit, social proof, CTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
    *   Components (benefits, CTA, onboarding explainer) can often be reused across different script frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Homework**: Write four different scripts to test with the winning video ad from the previous week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

### Week 4: Visual Hook Testing
Visual hooks occur in the first 3 seconds of an ad and are crucial for grabbing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Goal**: Test different visual hooks on your winning video ad from Week 3 to find the one with the best CAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Examples include dunking french fries into ketchup, pouring sugar into a Coke can, scooping coconut, or reverse paint dripping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Very interesting and unique visual hooks can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Measurement**: Create a custom metric in Facebook Ads Manager called "Hook Rate" or "Thumb Stop Rate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
    *   **Formula**: 3-second video view / impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
    *   A higher hook rate means people are stopping their scroll and are more likely to keep watching and be sold by your script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
    *   **Benchmarks**:
        *   Business-to-Consumer (B2C): 30% is a good benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
        *   Business-to-Business (B2B): Anything over 20% is good, aim for 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Homework**: Test four different visual hooks from your winning video ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

## Conclusion
By following this [[Creative strategy and testing for Meta ads | creative testing road map]], you should have winning ads that meet or beat your CAC goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Crucially, you will have a "menu" of proven ad elements, including visual hooks, scripts, image concepts, and pain points/messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

This process enables you to become a "master of modular creative," meaning you can take winning elements from one ad and apply them to new ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. This ability to [[testing_and_iterating_ad_concepts | recycle elements]] in future ads will increase your ad win rate, leading to more winning ads and, ultimately, more profitable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

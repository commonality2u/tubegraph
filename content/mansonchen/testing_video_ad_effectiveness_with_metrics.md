To scale profitably on Meta, it is essential to lower the cost per new ad creative and employ a high volume of creative content, as advertisers are competing against a vast amount of paid and organic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Ad effectiveness can be significantly improved by adopting a modular approach to [[creating_performance_video_ads | creating performance video ads]], viewing them as building blocks or Lego pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Modular Approach to Video Ads

Video ads consistently follow a structure: they begin with a hook, transition into a body video, and conclude with a call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The power of this modular system lies in the ability to reuse these video blocks and measure their effectiveness using specific metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. By mixing and matching different clips, net new video ads can be created simply by switching up the video timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This approach allows for continuous improvement based on data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Hooks can start with a visual metaphor of a problem, an unboxing clip, or something oddly satisfying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The body can begin with an unboxing video, then transition into benefits, a product demo, and finally, results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Key Metrics for Evaluating Video Ad Performance

When [[evaluating_ad_performance | evaluating ad performance]] and identifying areas for improvement, specific metrics can guide which component of the ad needs testing. These are considered [[key_metrics_for_evaluating_creative_performance_in_facebook_ads | Key Metrics for Evaluating Creative Performance in Facebook Ads]]:

*   **Hook Rate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
    *   This is a [[custom_metrics_in_facebook_ads | custom metric]] that can be created in Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
    *   **Calculation:** 3-second video view divided by impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   **Action:** If the Hook Rate is below 30%, it indicates a need to [[importance_of_testing_hooks_for_video_ads | test swapping out the hook]] while keeping all other components the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

*   **Hold Rate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
    *   This is defined as a "through play" or a 15-second video view divided by impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Action:** If the Hold Rate is below 10%, [[testing_strategies_for_video_ad_components | test swapping out the body]] of the video while keeping everything else constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

*   **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
    *   **Action:** If the Click-Through Rate is below 1%, [[testing_strategies_for_video_ad_components | test swapping out the call to action]] while maintaining the same hook and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Sourcing Ad Assets

Drastically cutting down on ad creative costs is possible by compiling assets from various sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Options include:
*   Filming content on a phone, which can yield excellent results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   Hiring individuals to film themselves and obtaining usage rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   Utilizing platforms like Billow or Insense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Leveraging Generative AI (Gen AI) to create AI-generated User Generated Content (UGC), often using platforms like TikTok or services for Gen AI avatars or b-roll with tools like Runway Gen 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Employing these methods can significantly slash overall ad costs and improve the Media Efficiency Ratio (MER) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Importance of Continuous Testing

While testing ads and sourcing content incurs costs, it's crucial to understand that advertising is a numbers game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. To compete effectively with vast amounts of paid and organic content, marketers must find ways to [[testing_strategies_for_successful_ads | test more ads]] without overspending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Studies show that a small percentage of ads account for a disproportionately large share of spend (less than 2% of ads get over 68% of spend, according to Appsflyer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Therefore, it is vital to have a repeatable, cost-effective process to identify winning ads, as creative strategists are often wrong more often than right; the goal is to create more "shots on goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

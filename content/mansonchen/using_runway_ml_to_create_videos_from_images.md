Creating [[ai_generated_video_content | AI generated video content]], specifically visual hooks, can be done by leveraging various [[tools_for_automating_video_ad_creation | AI]] tools. The process involves generating initial images and then using platforms like Runway ML to animate them into videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Process for creating visual hooks

The workflow for creating a visual hook involves several steps, from inspiration to final video generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>:

### 1. Finding inspiration
Begin by visiting websites like Lexica.art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This platform allows users to scroll through numerous image visuals to gather inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Users can also copy existing prompts associated with images they like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### 2. Generating initial images
Once a suitable prompt is identified, use an [[ai_assets_and_video_generation | AI]] image generation tool such as Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or Stable Diffusion XL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These tools allow you to create your own images based on the chosen prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. After generating several images, select the preferred one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### 3. Converting images to video with Runway ML
With a selected image, proceed to RunwayML.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Utilize their Gen 2 model, which can transform an image into a video using [[ai_assets_and_video_generation | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This step forms the core of the [[automatic_video_ad_creation | video ad generation process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### 4. Enhancing the video
After the initial video clip is generated (often around 4 seconds in length), you can apply custom effects and transitions to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This refinement helps create a polished visual hook suitable for various applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Hook Rate
> After creating and implementing a visual hook, it's recommended to test its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. A good hook rate is considered to be 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

To achieve significant financial success with Facebook ads, a foundational understanding of what truly resonates with customers is essential. While many might believe success stems from pixel-perfect designs or extensive marketing teams, the true foundation lies in a specific culture and mindset that prioritizes message clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Prioritizing the Message Over Aesthetics
Highly successful companies like Loop, BetterMe, and Headway understand that customers are primarily concerned with themselves, not a brand's colors, fonts, or mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This perspective encourages a culture where creativity is not stifled by excessive "guard rails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. The goal is to discover what genuinely resonates with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

It's important to foster an environment where "wild ideas" are encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, as average content is likely to be ignored in an age of AI-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Humans are still seen as superior in generating truly innovative, "wild" ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

> "The first thing that you absolutely need to know is a mindset that many overlook... The foundation of success is in level 99 design skills. It's culture. And what does that culture prioritize? Uh it's a culture that understands one fundamental truth. And their your customers don't really care about your brand colors or your font as much as you think. And yes, they care about themselves more than your mission to save all the baby seals or your mission to save all the dolphins." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>

## Clarity Over Cleverness
When crafting ad content, it is crucial to avoid being overly "clever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Instead, focus on being clear and concise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. If an ad's message is confusing, users will simply continue scrolling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

The message is arguably the most impactful element of an ad, influencing approximately two-thirds to three-quarters of its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Therefore, efforts should be concentrated on writing compelling copy that grabs attention and resonates with the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

## Starting with Statics to Nail the Message
The experimentation process for Facebook ads should begin by focusing on the core message. It's recommended to "get good at statics" before moving on to video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Static ads are an ideal starting point because they are:
*   **Cheap** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>
*   **Fast to create** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>
*   **Easy to test** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>

Simple examples of static ads can include a post-it note, a screenshot from Apple Notes, or even a printed piece of paper photographed in a unique context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

Mastering static ads helps in refining the core message before tackling the greater complexity of video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. Video ads involve more dimensions, such as duration, pacing, scripts (hook, problem, solution), and audio hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>, making it more challenging to isolate the impact of the message if not properly understood beforehand. Nailing the message early simplifies the entire ad creation and [[optimizing_and_scaling_facebook_ad_campaigns | scaling Facebook ad campaigns]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

This article outlines how to effectively test ad messaging and scripts as part of a four-week [[creative_testing_framework_for_meta_ads | creative testing roadmap]] designed to lower your Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) by 30% or more in 30 days or less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The core idea is to move away from a "spray and pray" approach and instead follow a structured [[testing_strategies_for_successful_ads | testing process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Creative Testing Setup
A recommended [[creative_testing_structure_for_meta_ads | creative testing structure for Meta ads]] involves separating a creative testing campaign from an Evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. In the testing campaign, you create ad sets where each ad set tests four different ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Each variation should test *one single thing* while keeping everything else constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This allows for clear identification of winning elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Winning ads that meet Key Performance Indicator (KPI) goals (e.g., cost per trial start or purchase) are moved into the Evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Ads that don't perform are cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, while ads that are "almost there" can be iterated on with new hooks, scripts, or visual concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Key setup recommendations include:
*   Starting with a broad audience in your target country (e.g., US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   Optimizing for your specific bottom-funnel KPI (e.g., purchase, install, lead, trial start) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   Allowing each ad to run until it gets at least 20 conversions to get a good read on Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   Pausing poor-performing ads automatically using triggers to save money and test a high volume without burning cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   Copying winning ads into your business-as-usual (BAU) campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. It's recommended to continue running the ad in the creative testing campaign to avoid performance fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   Dedicate 10-20% of your overall paid ads budget to testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   Always construct your creatives so that each variation tests one single element at a time to measure performance effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Week 1: Message Testing
Message testing is considered the "lowest hanging fruit" for ad testing because messages are often the reason a prospect converts into a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### Setup
*   **Goal:** To nail down the most painful problem your product alleviates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Control:** In Week 1, the control is a simple, static image concept (e.g., a black and white "fake tweet" style or a Post-it note/iPhone note app format) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This simple format can often outperform more complex ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Variations:** Test four different pain points with your messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. You can scale this up to 8, 12, or even 16 pain points across multiple ad sets, with four variations per ad set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Execution:** Run these different ads in separate ad set tests and aim for up to 20 conversions per ad to get a good idea of which message performs best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Week 3: Script Testing
Script testing focuses on the sales copy or voice-over within a video that converts a prospect into a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This week's testing builds upon a winning or promising video ad from the previous week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Script Frameworks
Scripts should be based on proven copywriting frameworks, leveraging the winning pain point identified in Week 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Here are three [[script_frameworks_for_video_ads | script frameworks for video ads]] you can follow:

1.  **Problem-Solution:**
    *   Text hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>
    *   Present the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>
    *   Present your solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>
    *   Talk about onboarding (if applicable, e.g., for an app) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>
    *   Talk about benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>
    *   End with a Call To Action (CTA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>

2.  **Differentiator:**
    *   Text hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>
    *   Polarize (e.g., "Most other solutions do this...") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>
    *   Talk about your unique mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>
    *   Introduce your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>
    *   Talk about benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>
    *   Social proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>
    *   CTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>

3.  **Pain Point Script:**
    *   Text hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>
    *   Present the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>
    *   Agitate the solution (or "twist the knife") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>
    *   Introduce your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>
    *   Differentiate your product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>
    *   Benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>
    *   Social proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>
    *   CTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>

These frameworks often allow for the reuse of components like benefits, CTAs, and onboarding explanations across different scripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Setup
*   **Goal:** To identify the most effective script for your winning video ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Variations:** Write four different scripts to test with the winning video ad from the previous week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Execution:** Run these different ads in separate ad set tests, aiming for 20 conversions per ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

By the end of this [[testing_and_iteration_for_successful_ads | iterative process]], you will have a clear understanding of which messages, concepts, scripts, and visual hooks perform best for your campaigns, allowing you to recycle winning elements in future ads and achieve more profitable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

Sovereign has demonstrated unexpected success with gaming companies, as highlighted by a case study with Rewardify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Dan, the Head of Mobile User Acquisition at Rewardify, initially wondered why more gaming companies weren't utilizing Sovereign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Since then, his team has experienced significant success, boosting [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] on their largest user acquisition channel by 170% month over month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

This success story is available on the Sovereign website under "Success Stories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Rewardify and Their User Acquisition Strategy

Rewardify is a real cash rewards gaming company with over a million satisfied players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Dan leads their mobile user acquisition efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. His team is small, consisting of an art director for game art, a playable ads designer, and a video artist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Dan is primarily responsible for creating video ads and their variations to acquire users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Their main user acquisition channel is AppLovin (AppL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. AppLovin is known for its reliability and lack of policy headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Similar to Meta and TikTok, AppLovin's algorithm thrives on [[role_of_creative_velocity_and_ad_variations_in_mobile_user_acquisition | creative velocity]] and a large number of ad variations to identify top-performing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## The Challenge: Manual Creative Iteration

Dan recognized the need to produce more video ads and variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. However, he faced significant time constraints due to other leadership responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Manually creating ad variations was a tedious process, involving:
*   Opening CapCut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   Pairing top hooks with top body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   Testing new hooks with new body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   Dealing with naming conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Manually creating variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

These manual tasks consumed valuable time, preventing him from focusing on more strategic aspects of his role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## The Sovereign Solution

Sovereign provided an automated solution to these challenges:
*   Users can upload hooks and main body videos separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   Sovereign automatically combines them to create new ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   It allows exporting in all standard sizes perfect for AppLovin (e.g., 9x16, 1x1, 4x5, 16x9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   The platform names all exported files according to custom naming conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Impact and Results

With Sovereign, Dan and his team were able to boost [[creative_testing_in_marketing_campaigns | creative testing]] on their largest UA channel by 170% month over month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This surge indicates a strategic shift towards more aggressive testing and iteration of top-performing ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. By exploring new combinations of hooks and body videos, they discovered new top-scaling ads and identified themes that might not have been tested otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

Ultimately, Sovereign enabled Dan to produce significantly more video ads in less time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This efficiency freed him up to concentrate on other critical aspects of his job, such as product strategy and overall company growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Many marketers struggle with [[iterating_video_ad_concepts | iterating on winning video ads on Meta]], often finding one successful ad but missing out on additional profit by not [[iterating_video_ad_concepts | digging deeper]] into that success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>. This is akin to finding gold but choosing to dig a new hole elsewhere instead of continuing to mine the existing vein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">00:00:08</a>. This article outlines a simple yet effective tactic to [[creating_performance_video_ads | make converting video ads]] 10 times faster and increase revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">00:00:13</a>. The strategies presented are based on testing thousands of [[creating_performance_video_ads | performance video ads]] at unicorn B2C mobile apps like Calm and Cash App <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">00:00:25</a>.

## The Power of Aggressive Hook Testing

A key strategy for [[iterating_and_improving_meta_ads | improving Meta ads]] is to aggressively and shamelessly test more visual hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">00:00:39</a>. While marketers typically test only three or four hooks, it's difficult to know if the absolute best hook for a concept has been found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">00:00:44</a>.

**Why Hooks Matter:**
*   TikTok research indicates that 50% of ad recall occurs within the first 2 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">00:00:53</a>. This highlights the short attention spans of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">00:00:58</a>.
*   New hooks can effectively target new users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">00:01:01</a>.

### Case Study: Simple Intermittent Fasting App

An 8-figure dating app, "The Simple Intermittent Fasting App," estimated to make $47.8 million per year, demonstrates this strategy effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">00:01:07</a>. They have launched at least 20 ad variations using the same core body video, differing only in their visual hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">00:01:17</a>. These variations are often launched on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">00:01:25</a>. This tactic is used with multiple core body videos and is not unique to this app, also being a favorite strategy at Calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">00:01:29</a>.

*   Many of their visual hooks are AI-generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">00:01:41</a>.
*   They often use just one text hook, such as "How to lose 40 lbs in one month," suggesting its strong performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">00:01:44</a>.
*   A key tip for [[video_ad_formula_for_meta | video ad performance]] is to prioritize message consistency from hook to body over strict visual consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">00:01:52</a>.
*   The hooks transition into a UGC testimonial mashup, a technique also favored by apps like Noom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">00:02:11</a>.

## Benefits of Hook Swapping

Hook swapping is one of the most effective ways of [[iterating_video_ad_concepts | iterating]] because it leverages an already proven ad concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">00:03:45</a>. It's a low-risk, low-effort, and high-reward approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">00:03:54</a>.

*   **Low Risk & High Reward**: Since the core concept works, only the hook is changed, making it a safe bet to find more winning variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">00:03:49</a>.
*   **Flooding the Market with "High Floor" Ads**: This tactic helps to "flood the market" with ads that have a much lower likelihood of failure, as the underlying ad concept is already validated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">00:03:09</a>.
*   **Increased Shots on Goal**: Just as a basketball player like Steph Curry needs to keep shooting to find success, marketers need to produce more ad variants to find the ones that will scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">00:03:17</a>.
*   **Proven by Top Mobile Apps**: Leading mobile apps like Calm, Simple App, Rise Science, and Headway understand the importance of launching a high volume of ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">00:03:30</a>.

### Analogy: iPhone Iteration

Consider iPhones: Apple found a winning product and has not significantly innovated on its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">00:04:09</a>. Each new iPhone version is like a [[iterating_video_ad_concepts | creative refresh]] with "new hooks" (e.g., better camera, more storage, new colors) while keeping the core product consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">00:04:22</a>. This mirrors the hook swapping strategy for ads.

## Tools and Metrics for Iteration

This means less than one out of 50 ad variants will scale, emphasizing the need for extensive testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">00:03:01</a>.

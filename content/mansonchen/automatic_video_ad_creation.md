## [[video_ad_generation_process | Video Ad Generation Process]]

The [[video_ad_generation_process | process]] for [[automating_video_ad_creation_with_sovran | automating video ad creation]] involves several steps:

1.  **Provide Company Information** Users input their company name and a description of what they do (e.g., "make delicious chicken sandwiches") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
2.  **Select Copywriting Tone** From 10 available options, users choose a copywriting tone, such as "assertive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
3.  **Initialize Clips** The "Initialize Clips" button is clicked, which activates background AI processes to generate visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The system provides status updates, such as "clips are initializing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. AI-generated visuals can take up to a minute to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
4.  **Create Video** Once the "Clip status succeeded" message appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, users click "create a video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The video status will change to "queued" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
5.  **Final Video Rendering** After the video finishes rendering, the "video status done" message will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, and the final video will be displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

[[Creative testing in marketing campaigns | Creative testing campaigns]] are essential for maximizing creative learnings and scaling potential in advertising. Improper setup can lead to wasted money on inefficient tests, performance plateaus, and spending on ineffective ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This approach is based on strategies proven effective with multi-seven-figure monthly Facebook ad spends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Key Statistics Illustrating the Need for Creative Testing

*   **Ad Variation Performance**: Only 2% of ad variations account for 68% of ad spend (Appsfly research) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Ad Exposure Impact**: Facebook found a 60% drop in conversions after four repeated ad exposures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Ad Lifespan**: 50% of ads don't last more than 2 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Creative Volume**: An analysis by Veros in May 2024 of 5,000 ad accounts with $10,000 to $100,000 in monthly spend showed an average of 103 creatives live with over 20 impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

These statistics underscore the [[importance_of_dedicated_creative_testing_campaign | importance of a high volume of diverse creatives]] to be tested smartly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Core Principles of Creative Testing Campaigns

### 1. Optimize for Key Conversion Events

Always optimize for a purchase, trial start, or an event that highly correlates with revenue growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. While optimizing for a higher-funnel objective like an install or registration can incrementally reach new audiences, it's difficult to do correctly without robust measurement in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. When optimizing for trial starts, ensure they are high-quality and pass these signals to Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### 2. Utilize Adset-Based Optimization

For [[creative_testing_in_facebook_ads | creative testing]], adset-based optimization is preferred over Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. CBO can cause underspending on ad concepts, making it difficult to assess how concepts or variations perform relative to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

While CBO can be used for short-term performance optimization (e.g., throwing "everything at the wall to see what sticks"), it often misses insights into specific creative dimensions that work, such as visual hooks, text hooks, angles, or creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Facebook's CBO often allocates most budget to only one or two ads, meaning many variations won't receive sufficient spend for meaningful learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. To maximize learnings, forcing spend to ads and adsets allows for clear performance tracking of variations and concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### 3. Implement Adset Tests with Variations

Aim for around four to six ad variations of an ad concept within each adset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. These variations can include:
*   Different hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>
*   Script variations, adjusting problem or solution statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
*   Music variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>

Crucially, **test one thing at a time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Maintain strict naming conventions to track each variation uniquely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### 4. Utilize Automated Stop-Losses

Automated stop-losses help eliminate wasteful spending by killing ads with a low likelihood of working, allowing for testing a high volume of creatives without overspending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Based on your funnel's conversion rates, set triggers to pause ads:

*   **Trigger 1 (3x CPA with zero conversions)**: If an ad spends 3x your target Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) (e.g., $150 on a $50 CPA goal) with no conversions, kill it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Trigger 2 (5x CPA)**: If an ad spends 5x CPA (e.g., $250) and is 25% above your CPA goal, kill it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Trigger 3 (10x CPA)**: If an ad spends 10x CPA (e.g., $500) and is still above your CPA goal, kill it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

These triggers can be adjusted over time based on payback period goals and historical conversion funnels (e.g., install to trial to paid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### 5. Disable Enhancements

Disable Facebook's automatic enhancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. They can negatively affect ad performance and introduce too many variables, making it harder to understand what specific elements of your creative are working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### 6. Scaling Winning Ads

When an ad performs well and isn't killed by stop-losses, you can scale it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>:
*   **Increase Daily Budgets**: Gradually increase daily budgets within the creative testing campaign's adset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Move to Evergreen Campaign**: Move winning ads into an evergreen campaign using the post ID method to consolidate social proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. To get a post ID, find the ad in Ads Manager, click "preview ad," then "see Facebook post with comments," and copy the numbers after the page ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Creative Testing Framework: Test, Iterate, Scale

This framework involves a [[creative_testing_for_facebook_ads | creative testing campaign]] and an evergreen (or scaling) campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

*   **Red Ads**: Ads with very high CPA; do not iterate on these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Green Ads**: Ads that hit your CPA goal after sufficient spend (e.g., 10x CPA); move these into your evergreen campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Yellow Ads**: Ad variations that are somewhat close to your CPA goal and show promise; iterate on these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. For example, switch out the hook, adjust the script framework, change editing/pacing, or try a different creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

A new concept can take two or three rounds of [[testing_and_iterating_ad_concepts | iteration]] before becoming a winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. If an ad concept is tested for four rounds of iteration and still doesn't work, it should be dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Final Considerations for Effective Creative Testing

*   **Avoid Copying Ads**: Be cautious of directly copying competitor ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Most ads are duds, and you don't know if they are actually working for competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Instead, derive high-level insights from competitors, such as the types of creators, angles, script frameworks, or concepts they continually iterate on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Sufficient Spend on Tests**: Do not draw conclusions on an ad variation's performance with less than $10 of spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Ensure enough budget is allocated to tests to gain meaningful learnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Enjoy the Process**: Having fun leads to more creativity, which in turn generates more ideas for winning ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

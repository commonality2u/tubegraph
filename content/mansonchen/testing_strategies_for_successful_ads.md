Winning ads are a result of a methodical testing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Effective video ads are designed in a modular fashion, allowing for a structured approach to [[testing and iterating ad concepts | testing and iterating ad concepts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This modularity means ads are built from distinct "blocks" or "building blocks" such as hooks, body videos, and calls to action (CTAs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Modular Ad Creation

The philosophy behind creating successful video ads is to assemble them in a modular way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This approach allows advertisers to think in building blocks:
*   **Hooks**: The initial part designed to grab attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Body Videos**: The main content delivering the message or value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Call to Action (CTA)**: The conclusive part prompting the desired user action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

This modular structure allows for flexible combinations, such as various text hooks leading into the same body script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. It enables advertisers to experiment with coherence levels and reorder existing clips to maximize content effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Key Testing Principle: Isolating Variables

A fundamental rule for [[testing_strategies_for_video_ad_components | testing video ad components]] is to [[testing_and_isolating_variables_in_ads | test one single variable at a time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

For instance, when [[testing_and_optimizing_ad_variations | testing and optimizing ad variations]]:
*   If the visual hook remains constant, the text hook can be varied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   If the body video is consistent, different visual hooks can be tested with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   The same script might be used, but with reordered visuals to compare performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

By isolating variables, advertisers can clearly identify which element contributes to an ad's success or failure, informing future [[iterative_testing_process_to_find_winning_ads | iterative testing processes to find winning ads]].

## Components for Testing

Advertisers like Dr. Squatch demonstrate a structured approach to [[creative_strategy_and_testing_for_meta_ads | creative strategy and testing]] by systematically testing different ad components to "stop the scroll" and engage their target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Hooks

Hooks are crucial for capturing initial attention. They comprise various elements that can be individually tested:

*   **Text Hooks**: These are headlines or opening phrases designed to pique interest.
    *   Examples of text hooks tested by Dr. Squatch for their deodorant:
        *   "Women will go feral for this natural deodorant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
        *   "Do you know why she likes it natural?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
        *   "Why women will go feral for this Dr. Squatch deodorant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
        *   "Three reasons this deodorant is dangerous for your love life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
    *   Common aesthetic for text hooks includes white text on a blue background, or white text with a black stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, placed at the top of the 9x16 safe zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

*   **Visual Hooks**: These are the initial visual elements of an ad.
    *   Testing often involves split frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   Typical visuals on the left side of a split frame include deodorant products or deodorant being peeled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   Visuals on the right side of a split frame might include a "naked hairy old dude," a girl in a towel smelling deodorant, or a girl smelling a man's armpit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   These visuals aim to immediately capture the attention of the target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

*   **Audio Hooks**: The initial audio elements of an ad are also crucial.
    *   An example of an audio hook: A girl's voice saying, "This is what a man should smell like. I will literally jump on any man wearing this scent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Body Videos

After the hook, the body video elaborates on the product or message.
*   **Content Types**:
    *   Listicles (e.g., "three reasons why") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   Educational explainers on natural ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Visuals**: Common themes in body videos include attractive women, men applying deodorant, and women showing attraction to men who use the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Calls to Action (CTAs)

CTAs are the final element, directing the viewer what to do next.
*   **CTA Variations**:
    *   "Just click this video right now to change your pit game forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *   "These deodorants sell out quick so I'd hop on this while you can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Consistent Visuals**: Both CTAs might use the same visual, such as a lineup of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

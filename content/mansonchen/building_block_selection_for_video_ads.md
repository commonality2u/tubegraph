[[creating_video_ads_faster | Creating video ads faster]] is possible without direct video editor involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This is facilitated by platforms designed to [[creating_performance_video_ads | create performance video ad]] variations at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## General Building Blocks for Video Ads

Video ads are typically constructed from three core components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>:

*   **Hook**: The opening of the ad, designed to grab attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Examples include a visual metaphor for a problem, an unboxing, or an oddly satisfying visual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Body**: The main content of the ad, usually a visual sequence that follows a [[script_frameworks_for_video_ads | script framework]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Common frameworks include:
    *   Problem-Agitate-Solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
    *   Unique Mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>
    *   Educational Script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
    *   "Three Reasons Why" Script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   **Call to Action (CTA)**: The concluding segment that prompts the viewer to take a specific action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Examples include "shop now," "download now," or "try for free" <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Tools like Sovereign help users mix and match these hooks, bodies, and CTAs, supporting a [[modular_creative_strategy_for_video_ads | modular creative strategy for video ads]] and a [[modular_approach_to_video_ad_creation | modular approach to video ad creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Enhancing Building Block Selection

Recent updates to video ad creation platforms enable more flexible and extensive building block selection for [[modular_approach_in_video_advertising | modular approach in video advertising]]:

### Unlimited Building Block Selection

Platforms now allow users to select an unlimited number of hooks, body videos, and call to action videos to stitch together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. For instance, combining 20 hooks with 10 body videos and 2-3 CTAs can produce 400 to 600 video ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. While not always advisable for budget reasons, this capability allows for vast experimentation and [[improving_video_ad_performance | improving video ad performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Users can upload up to 20 clips at a time for hooks, and an unlimited number for body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Project Management

For agencies or in-house teams, platforms now offer "projects" to organize assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Projects can be created for different ad concepts, new creators, creative testing rounds, or to house assets for different clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Bulk Text Addition to Visual Hooks

Users can now bulk add text overlays to visual hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This allows for uploading up to 20 raw visual hooks and applying a text overlay to all of them simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Text options include customizable copy (e.g., "three reasons why" or "did you know"), font, size, position, background color, and borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. After applying text, these new hooks can be stitched into body videos for further testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Measuring Performance and Efficiency

The ability to easily mix and match components facilitates extensive experimentation on the optimal order of hooks, body videos, and messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Key metrics to measure include:

*   **Hook Rate**: 3-second video views divided by impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Hold Rate**: 15-second video plays divided by impressions, measuring how many people watch past 15 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Using such platforms significantly reduces the time needed for video ad creation. One customer created 1,600 video ad variations in a quarter, reducing the time from 1 hour for a designer to 10-15 minutes using the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This demonstrates the efficiency gained in [[testing_strategies_for_video_ad_components | testing strategies for video ad components]].

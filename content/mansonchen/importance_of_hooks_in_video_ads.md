Video ads are designed in a modular fashion, consisting of hooks, body videos, and a call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Hooks are the initial elements of an ad, crucial for capturing viewer attention.

## Purpose of Hooks

The primary purpose of hooks in video ads is to [[importance_of_video_ad_hooks_in_marketing | stop the scroll]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. By grabbing immediate attention, hooks aim to prevent viewers from moving past the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Types of Hooks

Different types of hooks are employed to maximize engagement:

### Text Hooks

Text hooks are short, compelling phrases designed to pique interest. For Dr. Squatch's deodorant ads, examples of text hooks include:
*   "Women will go viral feral for this natural deodorant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   "Do you know why she likes it natural?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   "Why women will go feral for this Dr Squatch deodorant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>
*   "Three reasons this deodorant dangerous for your love life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

In terms of presentation for [[creating_engaging_text_hooks_in_ads | text hooks]]:
*   **Colors:** White text on a blue background, or white text with a black stroke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Placement:** Typically positioned at the top of the 9x16 safe zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Visual Hooks

[[Importance of visual hooks in video ads | Visual hooks]] are considered very important for stopping the scroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Effective [[visual_hooks_in_video_ads | visual hooks]] often involve:
*   **Split Frames:** A common strategy is to use split frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   **Left side:** Consistently features a visual of deodorant or deodorant being peeled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   **Right side:** Displays attention-grabbing scenes such as a naked hairy old man, a girl in a towel smelling deodorant, or a girl smelling a man's armpit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Audio Hooks

Audio hooks leverage sound to capture the listener's attention. For Dr. Squatch, a prominent audio hook uses a girl's voice saying:
*   "This is what a man should smell like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
*   "I will literally jump on any man wearing this scent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>

## Testing Hooks

[[Importance of testing hooks for video ads | Testing hooks]] is crucial to determine their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. When [[using_visual_hooks_and_iterations_in_ad_campaigns | testing video ads]], it is essential to test only one variable at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This means if the visual is the same, the text hook should be different, or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This methodical approach ensures that the impact of specific changes can be accurately measured.

When evaluating ad performance, simply sorting by Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) can be misleading, especially if aiming for [[scaling_facebook_ads | scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. An ad with the lowest CPA might have minimal spend or even zero purchases, making it an unreliable indicator for investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Introducing the "Ad Score"

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of ad performance, consider creating a custom metric called "Ad Score" (or a similar name like "Purchase Score") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This simple formula can provide 90% of the necessary insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Formula for Ad Score

The "Ad Score" custom metric can be set up directly in Facebook Ads Manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The formula is:

```
Purchases / Cost Per Purchase
```
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

### How the Ad Score Works

This custom metric helps analyze ads by prioritizing both volume and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>:
*   Ads with more purchases will achieve a higher score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Ads with a lower CPA will also result in a higher score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   If two ads have the same CPA, the ad that generated more purchases will be ranked higher due to a superior Ad Score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

This system allows for easy ranking of ads against each other, guiding where to allocate limited advertising resources effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

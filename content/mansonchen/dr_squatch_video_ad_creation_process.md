Dr. Squatch, a major soap brand primarily targeting men, employs a modular approach to [[video_ad_creation_workflow | video ad creation]] to effectively reach its audience of single men who desire a girlfriend and believe smelling good is key to achieving that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Their strategy, particularly for deodorant products, focuses on a structured assembly of ad components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Modular Ad Structure

Dr. Squatch's video ads are created in a modular way, utilizing distinct building blocks: Hooks, Body Videos, and Call to Actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This approach allows for efficient [[creating_video_ads_faster | creation]] and testing of various ad combinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Hooks

Hooks are designed to stop the scroll and grab the audience's attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

*   **Text Hooks**
    Dr. Squatch tests several text hooks, often with white text on a blue background or white text with a black stroke, placed at the top of the 9x16 safe zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>:
    *   "Women will go feral for this natural deodorant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
    *   "Do you know why she likes it natural?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
    *   "Why women will go feral for this Dr Squatch deodorant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
    *   "Three reasons this deodorant dangerous for your love life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>

*   **Visual Hooks**
    Visual hooks are crucial for stopping the scroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. They frequently use split frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>:
    *   **Left side:** Consistently features a visual of the deodorant product or deodorant peeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   **Right side:** Includes engaging and sometimes provocative visuals such as a naked, hairy old man, a woman in a towel smelling deodorant, or a woman smelling a man's armpit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

*   **Audio Hooks**
    Audio hooks often feature a girl's voice saying lines like:
    *   "This is what a man should smell like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
    *   "I will literally jump on any man wearing this scent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>

### Body Videos

Following the hooks, body videos provide more detailed content, sometimes referred to as "control" or "onramp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

*   **Content**: These often take the form of a listicle, such as "three reasons why," or an educational explainer detailing natural ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Visuals**: Common visual themes include attractive women, men applying deodorant, and women showing attraction to men who have applied the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Call to Action (CTA)

Dr. Squatch typically uses two types of call to actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>:

*   **CTA 1**: "Just click this video right now to change your pit game forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **CTA 2**: "These deodorants sell out quick so I'd hop on this while you can" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
Both CTAs are visually accompanied by a lineup of Dr. Squatch deodorant products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Strategic Approach to Ad Creation

Dr. Squatch's success in [[creating_performance_video_ads | performance video ads]] stems from a few key strategies:

*   **Modular Thinking**: Top advertisers like Dr. Squatch think in a modular way, allowing various text hooks to lead into the same body script <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Testing One Variable at a Time**: When testing video ads, it is crucial to test only one variable at a time to accurately assess effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. For example, the visual might be the same but the text hook different, or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Maximizing Existing Content**: The modular approach allows for maximizing the effectiveness of existing content by reordering clips and combining different hooks and bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

Winning ads are a direct result of this iterative and structured [[video_ad_generation_process | ad generation process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The use of building blocks for hooks, body videos, and call to actions, coupled with methodical testing, is central to their [[creating_video_ad_concepts | ad creation]] strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

Automated stop-losses are a critical component of [[effective_creative_testing_strategies_on_Facebook | effective creative testing strategies]] designed to maximize learnings and minimize wasted ad spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. By implementing these triggers, advertisers can test a high volume of creatives without overspending on underperforming ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Purpose and Benefits
The primary goal of automated stop-losses is to kill ads that have a low likelihood of working, thereby eliminating waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This allows for the testing of a high volume of creatives without incurring excessive costs on ads that won't convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Setting Up Triggers
Automated stop-losses are set up based on a funnel's conversion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. It's recommended to start with three initial triggers, which can be adjusted over time based on specific funnel metrics (e.g., install to trial, trial to paid) and payback period goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. E-commerce companies do not typically need to consider install to trial to purchase funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

### Recommended Initial Triggers
*   **Trigger 1: 3x CPA with Zero Conversions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>
    *   If an ad's spend reaches three times the target Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) and has yielded zero conversions, it should be killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   _Example:_ If the cost per trial is $50, and an ad has spent $150 with no trial starts, it should be killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

*   **Trigger 2: 5x CPA and 25% Above Goal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>
    *   If an ad's spend reaches five times the target CPA (e.g., $250 in the $50 CPA example) and its actual CPA is 25% above the goal, it should be killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

*   **Trigger 3: 10x CPA and Above Goal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>
    *   If an ad's spend reaches ten times the target CPA (e.g., $500 in the $50 CPA example) and its actual CPA is above the goal, it should be killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

## Integration with Scaling
Automated stop-losses play a crucial role in the scaling process. If an ad has not been killed by these triggers, it indicates potential for performance. Such ads can then have their daily budgets gradually increased within the [[importance_of_dedicated_creative_testing_campaign | creative testing campaign]]'s ad set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Alternatively, these performing ads can be moved into an evergreen campaign using the post ID method to consolidate social proof and maintain ad momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

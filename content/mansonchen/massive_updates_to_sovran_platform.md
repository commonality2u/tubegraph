Sovran is a platform designed to create performance video ad variations at scale, significantly speeding up the creative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The creator, previously in growth and creative strategy at Calm and Cash App, bootstrapped the platform to solve common pain points in video ad creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## How Performance Video Ads Are Structured

Video ads are generally built from three core components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>:
*   **Hook**: The opening, typically around 3 seconds long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Hooks can be a visual metaphor for a problem, an unboxing, or an oddly satisfying visual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Body**: The main visual sequence that generally follows a script framework such as "problem agitate solution," "unique mechanism," "educational script," or "three reasons why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Call to Action (CTA)**: The concluding segment, prompting actions like "shop now," "download now," or "try for free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Sovran helps users mix and match different combinations of these hooks, bodies, and call to actions to create numerous variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Key Updates to Sovran

The Sovran platform has received three significant updates aimed at enhancing ad creation efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

### 1. Unlimited Building Block Selection

Users can now select an unlimited amount of hooks, body videos, and call to actions to stitch together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. For example, selecting 20 hooks, 10 body videos, and 2-3 call to actions can generate 400 to 600 video ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### 2. Projects Feature

The new "Projects" feature allows users to organize assets for different ad concepts, new creators, or creative testing rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Performance creative agencies can use projects to house different assets for various clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Projects can be named based on client name, creator name, video ad concept, or creative round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### 3. [[bulk_create_hooks_feature_in_sovran | Bulk Add Text to Visual Hooks]]

Users can now [[bulk_create_hooks_feature_in_sovran | bulk add text to visual hooks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This means uploading up to 20 raw visual hooks and applying a text overlay on top of them simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Examples of text overlays include "three reasons why you can't sleep" or "did you know you needed this to lose 20 lbs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

This feature enables extensive experimentation on the optimal order and messaging of hooks and body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. After applying text, these new hooks can be stitched into existing or new body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## Measuring Ad Performance

When creating video ads, key metrics to monitor include:
*   **Hook Rate**: 3-second video view divided by impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Hold Rate**: On Meta, 15-second through play divided by impressions, measuring how many people watch past 15 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)**: A crucial business metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Platform Features and Workflow

Within the Sovran platform, users can:
*   **Create Video Ads**: Upload up to 20 clips at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Select Components**: Choose hooks (unlimited now), body videos (unlimited), and optional call to action videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Add Audio**: Add audio to each variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The ability to make audio/music a variation is coming soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Choose Aspect Ratio**: Select 1x1, 4x5, 9x16, or 16x9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Generate Variants**: After selecting components, the platform displays the number of combinations and credits required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Video ad variations are created within one to two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Automatic Naming Convention**: Variants come with an automatic naming convention (e.g., `hook_name_body_name_call_to_action_name_audio_file_name_aspect_ratio`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Users can also disable this and add their own custom file names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Customize Text Overlays**: When [[bulk_create_hooks_feature_in_sovran | bulk adding text to visual hooks]], users can customize the copy, choose font, edit size, position text (ensuring it avoids important visuals or stays in the safe zone for specific aspect ratios like 9x16), add background color, adjust border radius, and modify shadow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This text overlay is applied to all uploaded visual hooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Benefits and Accessibility

Sovran significantly reduces the time required for video ad creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. One customer reported that what took their designer 1 hour to create now takes them 10 to 15 minutes using Sovran, leading to 1600 video ad variations created in one quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

A 7-day free trial is available to test and create video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

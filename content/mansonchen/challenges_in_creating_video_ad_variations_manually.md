For companies like Rewardify, a real cash rewards gaming company with over a million players, the need to [[creating_video_ads_faster | create video ads faster]] and produce a high volume of [[creating_performance_video_variations | performance video variations]] is crucial for user acquisition (UA) efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. However, the manual process of creating these variations presents significant challenges.

## The Need for Creative Velocity
Dan, the Head of Mobile UA at Rewardify, identified that their largest UA channel, [[Applovin_UA_Channel | AppLovin]], thrives on "creative velocity" â€“ the ability to generate a large number of ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. This approach is similar to how platforms like Meta and TikTok operate, where algorithms select the best-performing ad variations from a diverse pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Despite knowing the necessity of creating more video ads for this channel, Dan faced a significant challenge in doing so manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Manual Ad Creation Process Difficulties
Dan's team at Rewardify is small, consisting of an art director, a playable ads designer, and a video artist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. When it comes to [[creating_video_ad_concepts | creating video ads]] and especially [[creating_performance_video_variations | video ad variations]] for user acquisition, Dan is the primary individual responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

The process of manually generating video ad variations was found to be "way too tedious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. Key difficulties included:
*   **Manual Combination:** Opening up video editing software like CapCut and manually pairing "top hooks" with "top bodies," or new body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. This also applied to [[testing_strategies_for_video_ad_components | testing new hooks with new body videos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
*   **Time Constraints:** The process was so time-consuming that Dan lacked the time at the end of the day to undertake these manual tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   **Naming Conventions:** Dealing with complex naming conventions for each variation manually added to the burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## Impact on Testing and Prioritization
The challenges of manual ad creation meant that Dan had to prioritize other responsibilities, including leadership decisions with the C-suite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This limited the ability to effectively [[testing_and_optimizing_ad_variations | test and optimize ad variations]], directly impacting performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

>[!info] Solution Impact
>By addressing these manual challenges, tools like Sovereign have enabled companies to [[improving_video_ad_performance | boost creative testing]] significantly, leading to the discovery of new top-scaling ads and identifying themes that might not have been tested otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. This efficiency frees up time for key personnel to focus on higher-level tasks such as product strategy and company growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

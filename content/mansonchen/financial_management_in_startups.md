Early-stage financial management in a startup involves closely monitoring revenue and expenses to assess viability and progress. An entrepreneur, Manson, shared insights from the initial three months of his [[building_and_growing_a_startup | bootstrapped company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01"></a>.

## Initial Revenue and Expenses

After approximately three months, the company secured its first two customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11"></a>. This milestone was achieved following 32 feedback sessions and two significant product pivots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13"></a>. These efforts resulted in a monthly revenue of $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17"></a>.

However, the monthly expenses for the tool amounted to about $132 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26"></a>.

## Current Financial Status

Currently, the company remains "in the red," indicating that expenses exceed revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31"></a>. Despite this, the entrepreneur expressed satisfaction that customers are willing to pay for the tool and perceive value in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31"></a>.

## Key Learning

A significant [[learning_from_entrepreneurial_mistakes | lesson learned]] from this early phase is the importance of creating a valuable product over one that is merely "cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40"></a>. The initial iteration of the product, an AI video platform designed to create AI videos without requiring user assets, was perceived as "cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48"></a>. This suggests that while innovation is important, market validation through customer willingness to pay for perceived value is crucial for financial sustainability.

## Ad Creation Process

The process for creating a [[creating_video_ad_concepts | video ad]] on the platform involves several steps:

### Inputting Information
Users begin by providing basic information:
1.  **Company Name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>: For example, "Chicken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  **Product/Service Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>: For instance, "make delicious chicken sandwiches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Choosing a Copywriting Tone
Users select a tone for their ad's copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The platform offers 10 different copywriting tones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. An example of a chosen tone is "assertive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Initializing Clips with AI
After inputting details, the "initialize Clips" button is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This action triggers background processes powered by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The system provides status updates, such as "clips are initializing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The generation of [[ai_generated_visuals_in_video_advertising | AI generated visuals]] can take up to a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Once finished, the status updates to "succeeded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Creating the Video
With the clips initialized, users proceed to create the video by clicking "create a video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The video status is updated, initially showing "queued" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Once the final video rendering is complete, the status changes to "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, and the finished video is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

The waitlist for this platform is currently open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

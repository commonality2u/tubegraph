After three months of working on a [[solo_bootstrapping_a_b2b_saas | solo bootstrap company]], the speaker secured their first two customers last week, reaching $100 a month in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This progress involved 32 feedback sessions and two pivots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Despite current expenses of $132 a month, meaning the company is still "in the red" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, the speaker is optimistic because people are willing to pay for the tool and see value in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This experience highlights [[challenges_of_starting_a_business | challenges of starting a business]] and the importance of adapting.

## Key Learning: Value Over "Cool"

A significant [[lessons_learned_in_b2b_marketing | learning]] from this entrepreneurial journey is the importance of "making something valuable instead of making something cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Initial Iteration

The first iteration of the tool, called Sovereign, was an AI video platform designed to create AI videos for anyone, even without existing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. While the concept was "cool," it lacked the essential value that customers were willing to pay for. The feedback sessions and pivots were crucial in identifying this gap and redirecting efforts towards a more valuable offering, demonstrating key principles in [[building_and_growing_a_startup | building and growing a startup]].

The Call to Action (CTA) is the final component of a simple video ad formula, following the hook and the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Its primary purpose is to instruct viewers on "what to do next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Video ads should conclude with a call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Importance Relative to Other Ad Elements

While essential, the call to action is not considered as crucial as the [[importance_of_video_ad_hooks_in_marketing | hook]] and the initial seconds of the video ad's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This is because the average view duration for video ads typically falls around five to six seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Modular Creative Strategy

The CTA is an integral part of hacking the Meta algorithm through a modular creative approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This strategy, recommended by Meta, involves distributing modular creative at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. For instance, combining 10 hooks, 10 bodies, and three calls to action can yield 300 video ad variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Benefits of Modular CTAs
*   **Easy Remixing**: Video blocks, including CTAs, are interchangeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Cost Reduction**: It helps drive down costs by allowing reuse of effective content rather than constant new content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Doubling Down on Winners**: Winning call to actions can be remixed with successful hooks and body videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Testing Call to Actions

Despite its lesser importance compared to the hook, it is advisable to [[importance_of_ab_testing_in_video_ads | test different call to actions]], especially when using software that facilitates this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. For example, True Classic has been observed testing various call to action variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

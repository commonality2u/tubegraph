The alloying concept is a mental model for [[creative strategy and testing for Meta ads | creative strategy testing]] borrowed from chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09">[01:09]</a>.

## Definition and Analogy
In chemistry, alloying involves mixing two or more metals together to achieve positive properties, such as steel being an alloy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12">[01:12]</a>. Applied to creative strategy, it means combining elements from different successful ads or concepts to create new, high-performing ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12">[01:12]</a>.

## Practical Application
This model suggests identifying successful creative elements independently and then strategically combining them.

### Example: Men's Mental Health App
One application of this model involved a men's mental health app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21">[01:21]</a>.
*   **Initial finding 1**: Image ads featuring sharks performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22">[01:22]</a>.
*   **Initial finding 2**: A new skeptical angle in ad copy also performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28">[01:28]</a>.

By combining these two successful elements, an ad was created featuring a skeptical script with heavy text overlay (white text with black stroke) on top of a shark image jumping out of the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33">[01:33]</a>. This combined ad became their best-performing ad for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46">[01:46]</a>.

> [!TIP] Recommendation
> It is recommended to try this technique of combining successful creative elements, as it often yields positive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50">[01:50]</a>.

This concept is also similar to the "Natural Selection" mental model, where winning ad "DNA" can be injected into other ads to create new winners, or winning ads can have slight variations to extend their lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24">[02:24]</a>.

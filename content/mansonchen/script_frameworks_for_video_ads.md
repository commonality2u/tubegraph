Several [[script_frameworks_for_video_ads | script frameworks]] can be followed when [[creating_performance_video_ads | creating video ads]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These frameworks, found on a "mirror board," include "the unique mechanism," "the paino," and "the education script framework" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. They all adhere to a similar underlying structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Benefits of Using Frameworks
Utilizing these [[script_frameworks_for_video_ad_creation | frameworks]] enables the creation of a wide variety of different video ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. They also facilitate extensive [[testing_strategies_for_video_ad_components | A/B testing]] of various components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Components for A/B Testing
Within these [[script_frameworks_for_video_ads | frameworks]], key elements that can be A/B tested include:
*   Social proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
*   Call to actions (CTAs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

### Importance of Text Hooks
The most crucial element to test within a video ad framework is the text hook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Text hooks appear at the beginning of the video ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

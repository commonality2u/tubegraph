The journey of balancing a career in acting with a personal life, particularly one that began in infancy, presents unique challenges and opportunities for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Early Career and Motivations

Starting an acting [[child_star_experience_and_its_impact_on_personal_life | career]] at eight months old meant the choice to act never truly existed, driven by the need for a single mother to provide for two twin boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This early immersion established a deep relationship with work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Initially, the motivation was financial pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, a stark contrast to children who pursued acting out of a desire for "craft" or "art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

This upbringing fostered a [[career_choices_and_life_balance | workaholism]] that persists, leading to a feeling of discomfort when not working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The early professional pursuits also instilled a strong work ethic and a desire to feel valued by both immediate family and the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Despite the lack of choice in entering the industry, there is a tremendous sense of gratitude for the financial stability achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The experience also "toughened the hell" out of him and his brother, allowing them to gain "10,000 hours in anonymously" before the advent of constant social media scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Parental Influence and Its Impact

His mother, described as a "tortured artist type," struggled with her place in the world and found self-identity through motherhood, attempting to turn it into a profitable business through her twin sons' acting careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This also satisfied a narcissism that sought artistic legitimacy and validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. The entertainment industry is seen as encouraging negative traits like narcissism, selfishness, and greed, which directly opposed the fundamental idea of motherhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Due to her unfitness, the court intervened and granted custody to his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. His mother grappled with mental illness, drug abuse, and primarily "a wicked narcissism" â€“ the inability to perceive anything outside her own perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Navigating Difficult Family Relationships
[[handling_personal_loss_while_maintaining_professional_performance | Dealing with a toxic family member]], particularly a parent, is a struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. It's challenging to reconcile the "immortal abstract connection" of family love with unacceptable behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. He views such experiences as lessons for humanity, distinguishing between love and care, and abandonment and pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. The ability to consistently choose care and love despite being deeply wounded by those who should be at your "Round Table" makes one a strong individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. However, self-love must come first, like putting on your own oxygen mask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

He began to recognize his mother's behavior as abnormal when social services intervened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. While the US legal system is biased towards mothers in custody cases, his father should have received custody due to the healthier, regimented environment he provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. He chooses not to be perceived as a victim of his [[child_star_experience_and_its_impact_on_personal_life | childhood circumstances]], asserting that what happened "carved and forged" him into the person he is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. He believes humans "trade trauma for wisdom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. He avoids sensationalizing his past pain, focusing instead on the strength that is a byproduct of it, much like Oprah Winfrey's story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. He believes life's lessons are given so one can triumph over them and use acquired traits to [[coping_with_personal_challenges_and_adversity | carve out who they are]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## The Demands of the Entertainment Industry

The entertainment industry encourages the worst qualities like selfishness and greed, while [[the_importance_of_authenticity_and_saying_no | authenticity and vulnerability]] are not encouraged traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>. For an actor, showing an authentic version of oneself can make it harder for audiences to suspend disbelief and see them as a character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.

Early acting, including roles like "Big Daddy" and "Friends," transitioned into "The Suite Life on Disney" where it became a commercial pursuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>. At this point, acting was not enjoyable as it took him away from school and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. His journey has been about balancing art and commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>, taking commercial jobs for financial stability while also pursuing projects that reinvigorate his passion for the discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.

Fame has significantly impacted his private life. His "camera duels" Instagram account, where he covertly photographed people taking pictures of him without permission, stemmed from social anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. While understanding why people seek photos for [[audiences_perception_and_performative_happiness_in_relationships | validation]] and social media display, he prefers deeper emotional connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. He finds surface-level interactions (like taking a picture) less memorable than meaningful conversations, such as those about the impact of his film "Five Feet Apart" on individuals with cystic fibrosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Well-being

### Battling Workaholism and Validation Seeking
The [[career_choices_and_life_balance | workaholism]] developed in childhood has persisted, coupled with a deep-seated need for validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. He acknowledges that his "dark side" is the narcissistic part that seeks external stimulation and validation from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>. He spirals when facing invalidation but tries not to let it linger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>. He is actively questioning what would happen if he "stepped away for good" to simply "enjoy my life" and live sustainably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, pondering if he would truly be content or if his upbringing's pressure would compel him back to the arts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### [[coping_with_personal_challenges_and_adversity | Coping with Anxiety]]
He describes social anxiety as a "warm sort of blanketing feeling, but it's hot," like being in a sauna that's too hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>. His coping mechanism involves activating his five senses to ground himself in the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. This technique was learned in therapy, emphasizing the importance of presence as the "greatest enemy of anxiety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.

For heightened emotional states, he takes breaks from whatever he is doing, communicating his need for time to calm down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>. He approaches situations with logic to think more clearly and calmly, although this can be off-putting to others who are emotionally heightened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>. He reminds himself that he is not alone in experiencing anxiety and that his perception of a problem's vastness may not align with others' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.

### [[the_importance_of_authenticity_and_saying_no | Setting Boundaries]]
His early life, beginning acting at eight months old, meant boundaries were easily exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>. He admits to not loving himself enough in his mid-to-late twenties, leading to people-pleasing in professional and romantic relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>. This involved crossing his own boundaries to make others feel better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. As he has aged, he has become more comfortable with "turning people off" and polarizing individuals, recognizing that not everyone will get along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>. His primary boundary is a strong dislike for condescension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>.

### Love and Personal Growth
His current relationship, with an emotionally understanding partner, has helped him reinforce boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. He learned that love is not about ensuring everyone is constantly happy, and that it's impossible to "control a situation through making sure everyone is happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>. His past relationships were hindered by his people-pleasing nature and fear of being perceived as anything other than perfect, leading to suppressing his emotions and fear of retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. These behaviors stemmed from his upbringing and his "tenuous and fractured relationship" with his mother, which led him to believe he could "fix things" for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>.

## Reflection on the Journey

He believes he was initially placed in an authority position as a child breadwinner, which led him to wrongly blame himself for relationship failures, including his mother's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. However, he now understands that it takes two people to participate in any relationship for it to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. His unique upbringing as a working child has deeply affected his relationships, but he is now on a path of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>.

What makes him feel alive now is passionate conversation, which he fosters by surrounding himself with like-minded individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>. He sees empathy as the currency of meaningful connections, allowing people from different backgrounds to understand each other's feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:25">[01:15:25]</a>. He strives for more [[the_importance_of_authenticity_and_saying_no | authenticity]], standing his ground and setting boundaries, and recognizing his own bottom line behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>. He views the pursuit of comfort as absurd and believes in taking accountability and fighting against labels to explore diverse experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>.

Ultimately, he hopes to be remembered as a good person who tried everything and lived a rich body of experiences, rather than being confined by labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>. His ultimate "last piece of work" would be to ensure his children are okay, creating ease for them in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>, or for grandchildren, sending them on a great treasure hunt for a memorable story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>. He distinguishes between "work" and deeply passionate endeavors like acting or photography, hoping not to view the latter as work at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:36">[01:22:36]</a>.

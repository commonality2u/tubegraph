Most people do not achieve financial freedom in their lives because they misunderstand the "language of money" and allow psychological barriers to hold them back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Entrepreneur Cody Sanchez emphasizes that understanding the language of money is crucial, as it is not as complex as it seems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Financial lingo is often used to make it sound complex, allowing those who speak it to charge more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

The gap between the wealthy and others is widening, with the richest 1% projected to control over half the world's wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Only one in ten people dies wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Expertise in the language of money can lead to significant financial gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Identifying and Addressing Psychological Barriers

### Fear and External Influence
A significant barrier is fear, often manifesting as waiting for the "perfect time" or lacking confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Cody Sanchez describes herself as a "scaredy cat" who needed a soft landing when transitioning from a corporate job to entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Loved ones, though supportive, can inadvertently hold individuals back by prioritizing safety and security over growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. They may question the pursuit of new opportunities, asking, "Is the grass always greener?" or "Are you sure it's not you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This often stems from a desire to keep you safe, which can be counterproductive to the risks required for real growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Real growth happens when you take risks and potentially fail, realizing you won't "die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Sanchez's family's desire to keep her safe led her to change jobs repeatedly before realizing she wanted to work for herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### Internal Stories About Money
Many people harbor negative emotional attachments and "bad stories" they tell themselves about money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. An exercise where women were asked to picture money and assume a physical shape revealed common reactions like fetal positions, shame, and guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. This contrasts with a healthy relationship with money, which should be open and welcoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

### The Get-Rich-Quick Fallacy
The modern world often promotes the idea of getting rich quick, leading people away from the "boring and slow" paths of wealth building, like that of Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>. This desire for instant gratification can be seen in trends like NFTs and crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. For those who feel trapped in their everyday reality, short-term pleasures like buying a PlayStation might offer a temporary sense of self-worth or escape, even at the cost of financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. This overcompensation for a lack of money, driven by shame, can hinder wealth preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

### Overcoming the Desire for External Validation
Advertising and social media perpetuate "mimetic desire," where people seek material possessions (like Bentleys or Rolexes) because they see others with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>. This leads to a pursuit of wealth for external validation rather than genuine financial freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Celebrities, for example, often showcase their wealth and glamour but rarely the "deals" or the hard work behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.

## Practical Steps to Break Free

### Shifting from "Renters" to "Owners"
Cody Sanchez believes that society has shifted from a "nation of owners" to "a nation of renters or serfs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. The goal is to get people into the "owner's chair," taking back control of their lives instead of letting others be their architects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

### Starting Small and "Stair-Stepping"
For individuals feeling [[understanding_and_overcoming_stuckness_in_life | stuck in a job]] they dislike, Cody Sanchez recommends a "stair-step" approach rather than burning bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This involves starting small by buying "boring businesses" that don't require full-time attention or significant initial capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. For example, her first acquisition was a laundromat for $100,000, which didn't require her constant presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. Businesses, like real estate, can be sold after getting into the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. These "gateway drug businesses" change your perspective and reveal that opportunities to buy businesses are everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

### Leveraging Your "Unfair Advantage"
Instead of buying a random "boring business," individuals can leverage their existing knowledge or professional network. Cody Sanchez advises a "personal P&L review" to identify current expenses that could be turned into assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. For someone in content creation, this could mean acquiring a video production company that serves their existing network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

### The Art of Deal Making
The ability to read a balance sheet and understand profit and loss statements is more important than industry-specific competence when buying a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. The difference between a billion-dollar deal and a small one is "materially" non-existent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Many small businesses can be acquired with little to no upfront cash through "seller financing," where the seller acts as the loan, deferring their tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

Sales, in this context, is not about changing minds but about discovering what people already want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. It's about identifying "motivated sellers" who are ready for their next adventure, and then presenting yourself as a trustworthy "good shepherd" for their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

### The Power of "Who, Not How"
To accelerate progress, individuals should "break their frame" and consider how to achieve a three-year goal in six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. The answer to freedom is often a "who" rather than a "how" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. By seeking out mentors or "a players" who can provide an "unfair advantage," hustlers can gain access to information and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. This means getting "behind the curtain" to understand the "money games" played by high-net-worth individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

## Cultivating a Success Mindset

### Embracing Long-Term Thinking
Billionaires often share a common trait: a mission so grand it overshadows the inherent pain of building a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. They prioritize long-term games, understanding the power of compounding time, as exemplified by a CEO who ran his company for 61 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. This perspective allows them to "water seeds" for future opportunities, making bets on rising talents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

### The Power of Content Creation
Content creation offers "unfair access" and acts as a magnet, drawing opportunities and connections to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>. Instead of traditional "door-to-door sales" or networking events, content allows you to "pull" people to you, creating a more sustainable and cost-efficient long-term strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>. It also helps you find like-minded individuals who want to see you succeed, which is more valuable than monetary winnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>.

### Surrounding Yourself with High Performers
The people you surround yourself with significantly impact your performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Being in proximity to a high performer can increase your productivity by 15%, while being near a low performer can decrease it by 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. [[overcoming_societal_and_personal_obstacles | Outgrowing social circles]] is a natural, albeit uncomfortable, part of growth, as those left behind may feel confronted by your progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. Surrounding yourself with winners fosters a culture of continuous learning and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

### Normalizing Imperfection
Success is not about being perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Successful individuals also have flaws, make mistakes, and have periods of low productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. It's crucial to acknowledge that anyone, including a "working John," can figure out how to achieve success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

### [[Personal growth and breaking away from limiting circumstances | Breaking Free from Limiting Circumstances]]
Sometimes, the greatest courage lies in *not* pursuing a path that others expect of you or that you feel obligated to take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Like climbing a mountain you don't care about, staying in a job or relationship that doesn't align with your true desires requires an "exit tax" – a cost, both emotional and financial, for [[coping_with_personal_challenges_and_adversity | leaving a miserable situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>. However, on the other side of this tax lies true freedom and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a>. [[steps_to_improve_selfawareness_and_overcome_personal_struggles | Setting clear deadlines]] for personal change can be a powerful motivator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

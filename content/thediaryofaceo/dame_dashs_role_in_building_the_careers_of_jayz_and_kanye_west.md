Dame Dash is recognized as one of the biggest pioneers in hip-hop, having co-founded [[the_foundation_and_success_of_rocafella_records | Roc-A-Fella Records]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Through this venture, he played a pivotal role in discovering and developing the careers of artists like Jay-Z and Kanye West, among many others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Championing Jay-Z

Dame Dash's commitment to Jay-Z was evident from the outset. He took Jay-Z to "every single label, and they all said no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The reasons for rejection included Jay-Z being considered "too old" or rapping "too fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>. Faced with these rejections, Dame Dash decided they would "do it [themselves]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>, leading to the self-establishment of Roc-A-Fella Records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Business Philosophy with Artists
Dame Dash's approach differed from the traditional music industry model. He explains that record labels typically offer an advance in exchange for all rights to an artist's record and art, giving the artist only 10% (or 8% if lucky) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. This "didn't make sense" to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Instead, he preferred doing "partnerships" with his artists, aiming to help them maintain their "manhood" rather than being "signed to another man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

Dame Dash aimed to teach his artists how to be independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. He notes that typically, the businessman has more money than the artist, but in his case, the artists often had more money than the businessman, implying he wasn't exploiting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

## Nurturing Kanye West's Vision

Dame Dash "discovered" Kanye West and gave him the same opportunities and protection as every other artist at Roc-A-Fella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>. He credits Kanye's success to his unwavering confidence and commitment to his dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>.

Kanye West was notably receptive to Dame Dash's guidance:
*   Kanye "would listen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:23">[00:56:23]</a>.
*   If told to have cameras with him, he did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>. This dedication is exemplified by Kanye recording "Through the Wire" with a broken jaw after Dame sent him equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.
*   When brought to London, Kanye would "just jump on the table and rap" if told to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>.

Dame Dash describes Kanye as "a real artist" who is "in different dimensions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:55">[01:07:55]</a>. Kanye focuses heavily on fashion and is deeply invested in the sonic aspects of his music, producing his own beats with an artistry that commands respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>. Unlike others, Kanye is not afraid to express his opinions and "is an artist that likes war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.

> "Art is something that you would really fight for if you love it even if your message is misunderstood like white lives matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

Kanye's commitment is described as working "every single second until he passes out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>, with "every second... devoted to art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>. Dame Dash notes that Kanye himself stated, "I'm Dame Dash with a whole lot of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>. However, he also suggests that Kanye's wealth came from working with corporations, which "triggers" him, implying that external influence can impede an artist's happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>.

## The End of Roc-A-Fella Records

The Roc-A-Fella chapter of Dame Dash's career eventually concluded. He heard from L.A. Reid that Jay-Z wanted to take a president job at Def Jam but only if Dame and Biggs were not involved with Roc-A-Fella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. Jay-Z confirmed this, stating he wanted to be seen as a businessman, which he felt he couldn't achieve with Dame around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:09">[01:05:09]</a>.

Dame Dash viewed this as an "out" from the music business, as he was already transitioning to fashion and tired of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>. He admits he would have continued running Roc-A-Fella "out of obligation" due to his commitment, but because of the situation, he allowed it to be taken over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.

Jay-Z is characterized by Dame Dash as being "about the money, period," while Kanye is "about the art and the money, but it's the art" that drives him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>.
Despite the past, Dame Dash expresses no feelings towards Jay-Z now, whether good or bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:55">[01:06:55]</a>. He believes the success of [[the_foundation_and_success_of_rocafella_records | Roc-A-Fella Records]] was "because it was real" and because he refused to conform to industry norms or listen to those who doubted their vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>.

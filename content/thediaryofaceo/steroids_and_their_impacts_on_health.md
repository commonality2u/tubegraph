## Steroids and their impacts on health

Dr. Michael Israel, a leading sports scientist, discusses the effects of steroids on muscle building, health, and psychological well-being, drawing from both scientific literature and personal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### What are Steroids?
Steroids, in this context, are testosterone-like molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:09">[01:27:09]</a>. They can be taken orally as pills or injected into muscles, commonly in the quads, shoulders, or glutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>.

### Benefits of Steroid Use (and caveats)
While sarcastically stated as "great," steroids are highly effective for putting on muscle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>.
*   **Muscle Growth**: Individuals can gain 30-40 pounds of muscle tissue compared to not using steroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. With the same workout, steroid use can literally double muscle gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56">[01:20:56]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Recovery**: Steroids allow for faster, better, and more complete recovery, enabling more sets and sessions per week, leading to two and a half times more muscle growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>.
*   **Visible Changes**: Visually, differences become noticeable after a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:19">[01:20:19]</a>.

### Health Risks and Side Effects
The speaker emphasizes that the benefits of steroids come with significant long-term health trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>.
*   **Cosmetic Downsides**:
    *   Increased body hair growth (more pronounced in females) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:28">[01:22:28]</a>.
    *   Hair growth on ears and nose (for some individuals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>.
    *   Pimples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>.
    *   Increased probability of balding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>.
*   **Long-term Health Risks**:
    *   Substantially increased risk of heart disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:47">[01:21:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:49">[01:21:49]</a>.
    *   Increased blood pressure (can be counteracted with drugs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:53">[01:21:53]</a>.
    *   Much higher probability of kidney failure later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:57">[01:21:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:58">[01:21:58]</a>.
    *   Increased probability or severity of cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06">[01:22:06]</a>.
    *   Increase the probability of nearly every central systemic disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>.
*   **Youth-Specific Risks**:
    *   For teenagers (under 22 for males), certain steroids can close growth plates early, preventing them from reaching their full adult height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:28">[01:22:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:32">[01:22:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">[01:22:38]</a>.

### Psychological Impacts
Psychological side effects are often the most displeasing part of taking steroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:01">[01:23:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:06">[01:23:06]</a>.
*   **Mood and Temperament**:
    *   Radical increases in anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>.
    *   Radical increases in aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:57">[01:25:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>.
    *   Increases in disagreeableness and probability of confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:03">[01:25:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>.
    *   Uncontrollable fantasies of rage, aggression, and revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:45">[01:27:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:49">[01:27:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:51">[01:27:51]</a>.
    *   Increased proclivity to "honor culture" thought patterns, where minor perceived slights are catastrophized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:21">[01:27:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Function**:
    *   Substantially reduce fluid intelligence while taking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:10">[01:25:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:11]</a>.
    *   May reduce overall intelligence in the long term, though some recovery is possible after cessation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">[01:25:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:17">[01:25:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>.

### Reproductive Health Impacts
*   **Testicular Shrinkage**: Roughly half of users experience testicular shrinkage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">[01:23:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>.
*   **Fertility**: A profound decrease in fertility and ejaculate volume is common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:34">[01:23:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>. However, it does not mean complete infertility, as some individuals have fathered children while on steroids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:42">[01:23:42]</a>.
*   **Libido and Erectile Function**: Depending on the specific steroid and individual biology, libido can be unaffected, profoundly increased, or lead to erectile dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:03">[01:24:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:14">[01:24:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:28">[01:24:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>. The size of the penis is not affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:51">[01:23:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:56">[01:23:56]</a>.

### Personal Motivation and Reflection
Dr. Israel shares his personal reasons for using steroids, acknowledging the significant trade-offs:
*   **Industry Relevance**: Initially, using steroids was seen as a path to being taken seriously as an educator and thinker in the fitness industry, where being "super jacked and super lean" was often a prerequisite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:22">[01:29:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:23">[01:29:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:25">[01:29:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:39">[01:29:39]</a>.
*   **Personal Preference for Size**: A deep-seated desire to be "enormous and ripped," stemming from an extreme end of masculinity brain-wise, akin to a child's awe of a garbage truck or tank, or wanting to be like the Hulk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:55">[01:29:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:02">[01:30:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:12">[01:30:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>.
*   **Response to Childhood Bullying**: A past experience of bullying led to a deep-seated feeling of powerlessness and a resolve to never be bullied again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:48">[01:31:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:04">[01:32:04]</a>. This contributed to a desire for physical presence as a form of self-defense and honor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:20">[01:32:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:23">[01:32:23]</a>.

> "Enough bullying make you consider doing terrible things to regain your honor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:54">[01:37:54]</a>

Despite the motivations, Dr. Israel acknowledges he is currently winding down his competitive bodybuilding and steroid use due to the need for his brain and "fluid civility" in other aspects of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:46">[01:28:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:50">[01:28:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:59">[01:28:59]</a>. He emphasizes that for the average health-conscious person, supplements are "insanely overrated" and not among the top 10 important things, which include adequate [[sleep and its impact on health | sleep]], stress management, and consistent lifting and physical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:07">[01:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:11">[01:17:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:13">[01:17:13]</a>.

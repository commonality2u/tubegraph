Glucose, also known as blood sugar, is the body's primary source of energy, utilized by every cell, including brain cells for thinking, speaking, and moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. However, when the body is flooded with too much glucose too quickly, it leads to what is called a [[glucose_spikes_and_health_implications | glucose spike]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. Jesse Inchauspé, known as the "Glucose Goddess," is a biochemist and author who teaches methods to eat well without giving up favorite foods by managing glucose levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Importance of Glucose Management
Jesse Inchauspé's personal health journey, including a broken back at age 19 that led to severe chronic mental health issues like depersonalization, spurred her quest to understand how the body works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Her research revealed a significant link between her [[glucose_spikes_and_health_implications | glucose levels]] and her [[impact_of_glucose_on_mental_health_and_aging | mental health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Using a [[continuous_glucose_monitors_and_their_benefits | glucose monitor]], she observed a direct correlation between blood sugar spikes and her episodes of depersonalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

### Why Glucose Spikes are Detrimental
Most people, even without diabetes, experience [[glucose_spikes_and_health_implications | blood sugar spikes]] daily without realizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. Historically, it was thought that only those with diabetes needed to monitor glucose, but this understanding has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

Common short-term [[effects_of_glucose_spikes_on_health | symptoms of glucose spikes]] include:
*   Intense cravings for sweet foods multiple times a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. These cravings are biologically driven by glucose drops activating the craving center in the brain, often triggered by a previous meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. The release of dopamine from sweet foods also contributes to their addictive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.
*   Unsteady energy levels and chronic fatigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
*   Brain fog, impacting memory and clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.
*   Poor sleep quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.

Long-term [[effects_of_glucose_spikes_on_health | consequences of consistent glucose spikes]] include:
*   Increased [[impact_of_glucose_on_mental_health_and_aging | aging]] (glycation), visible as wrinkles on the skin and internal deterioration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>.
*   Skin issues like acne, eczema, and psoriasis due to inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. Inflammation, a stress response from the body, is a major health concern, with three out of five people globally dying from inflammation-based diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.
*   Elevated risk of long-term brain problems like dementia and Alzheimer's (sometimes called type 3 diabetes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.
*   Worsening menopause symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.
*   Impact on [[role_of_glucose_in_fertility_and_hormone_balance | fertility]] and hormonal balance, particularly polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. High insulin levels from glucose spikes can increase testosterone in females, leading to PCOS symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.
*   Faster development of pre-diabetes and [[potential_for_reversing_type_2_diabetes_through_dietary_changes | type 2 diabetes]] due to chronic insulin release and insulin resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>.
*   Increased risk of cancer and heart disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.

On a cellular level, during a glucose spike:
*   Mitochondria (the energy producers in cells) become overwhelmed and shut down when flooded with too much glucose too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>. This leads to increased stress and inflammation in the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.
*   Glycation, the aging process, accelerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.
*   The body releases insulin to quickly lower high glucose levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>. Insulin stores excess glucose in muscles, liver, and [[belly_fat_burning_hacks | fat cells]], contributing to [[belly_fat_burning_hacks | fat gain]] and making [[belly_fat_burning_hacks | fat loss]] harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>.

Modern food landscapes, driven by human desires for sweetness and pleasure, have created an environment that promotes these spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. Fruits have been bred to be much sweeter and less fibrous than their natural ancestors, and the extraction of sugar from plants to create products like sodas and fruit juices further exacerbates glucose spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.

## [[Dietary hacks to manage glucose levels | Glucose Management Hacks]]

Instead of eliminating sugar, the focus should be on learning how to consume it in a way that minimizes spikes and their harmful effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. Here are some key strategies based on scientific principles:

1.  **Eat Food in the Right Order** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>:
    Eating the components of a meal in a specific sequence can reduce the [[glucose_spikes_and_health_implications | glucose spike]] by up to 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.
    *   **Veggies first**: This is the most crucial step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. Vegetables contain fiber, which forms a viscous, protective mesh on the walls of the upper intestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:59">[00:52:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>. This "fiber shield" slows down the absorption of glucose from later-consumed foods into the bloodstream, resulting in a smaller spike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. Aim for vegetables to be about 30% of your meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.
    *   **Proteins and fats second**: These should follow the vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.
    *   **Starches and sugars last**: Consuming these after fiber, protein, and fat helps mitigate their immediate impact on blood sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>. For instance, having bread (a starch) on an empty stomach causes a rapid glucose spike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>. There's no need to wait between eating these components; simply eating them in order is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.

2.  **Opt for a Savory Breakfast**:
    A sweet breakfast, like cereals with banana and honey, triggers a large glucose spike that can cause a "glucose roller coaster" for the rest of the day, leading to cravings and energy dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Instead, prioritize a savory breakfast with protein (e.g., eggs, fish, meat, protein powder) and fat (e.g., avocado) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. Starches or sugars, if included, should be for taste rather than the main component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>.
    *   **Whole Fruit vs. Processed Fruit**: While fruit has been bred to be sweeter, whole fruit is still a better sweet option due to its fiber content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. However, processed forms like fruit juice remove the protective fiber, leading to massive glucose spikes comparable to drinking soda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>.

3.  **Move After Eating**:
    Physical activity after a meal helps your muscles soak up glucose from the bloodstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:36">[01:12:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:39">[01:12:39]</a>. When muscles contract, they need energy, which they first draw from available glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>. Even 10 minutes of movement can significantly reduce a glucose spike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>. Examples include walking, cleaning, playing with a pet, or doing calf raises, which are particularly effective because the soleus muscle in the calf is adept at soaking up glucose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>.

4.  **Drink Vinegar Before Meals**:
    One tablespoon of vinegar mixed in a tall glass of water before a meal can reduce the [[glucose_spikes_and_health_implications | glucose spike]] by up to 30% and the insulin spike by up to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:22">[01:10:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>. Vinegar contains acetic acid, which slows down the breakdown of starches into glucose and tells muscles to absorb more glucose as it enters the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:41">[01:10:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>.

5.  **"Put Clothing on Your Carbs"**:
    When eating starches and sugars, add protein, fat, or fiber to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:06">[01:17:06]</a>. For example, pairing chocolate cake with Greek yogurt can lessen its impact on glucose levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>.

6.  **Stop Counting Calories**:
    The traditional method of measuring calories by burning food does not reflect how that food will impact the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>. Two foods with the same calorie count can have vastly different effects on glucose levels, leading to varied symptoms like cravings, fatigue, inflammation, or weight gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. Focusing on balancing glucose levels rather than calorie restriction leads to significant health improvements and is a more sustainable approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:45">[00:59:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:48">[00:59:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:33">[01:01:33]</a>.

### Overall Philosophy
The goal of these [[dietary_hacks_to_manage_glucose_levels | hacks]] is not to eliminate beloved foods, but to understand how to consume them in a way that keeps [[glucose_spikes_and_health_implications | glucose levels]] steady <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:15">[01:20:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:18">[01:20:18]</a>. By understanding these fundamental scientific principles, individuals can gain control over their physical and [[impact_of_glucose_on_mental_health_and_aging | mental health]] and mitigate symptoms without feeling overly restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>.

There are common misconceptions regarding the [[misconceptions_about_normal_sexual_practices_and_health | effects of masturbation]], with some people believing that excessive masturbation can cause prostate cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. However, scientific studies indicate the opposite.

## Research Findings

A well-conducted study on ejaculation frequency and prostate cancer found that men who ejaculated 21 times or more per month were less likely to develop prostate cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>. This finding is a statistical correlation, not a definitive causative link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>.

## Prostate Stagnation Hypothesis

One theory for this observed correlation is the "prostate stagnation hypothesis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. According to this hypothesis, fluids that contribute to ejaculate come from the prostate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>. Frequent ejaculation helps to clear and replenish these fluids, potentially preventing prostate cancer by "cleaning the pipes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>.

## Important Considerations

While there appears to be a benefit, it is not mandatory to ejaculate 21 times a month for prostate health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>. It's also important to consider that men who ejaculate more frequently may also be healthier in other aspects of their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>. Although studies attempt to control for confounding factors like comorbidities and marital status, there can still be uncontrollable variables that influence the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>.

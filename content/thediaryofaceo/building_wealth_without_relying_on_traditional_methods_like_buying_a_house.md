Jaspreet Singh, a financial guru, realtor, and entrepreneur, argues that many common beliefs about [[Building Wealth from Scratch | building wealth]] are myths. He emphasizes that you *can* [[Building Wealth from Scratch | build wealth]] even if you rent, and you don't need millions of dollars to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The true path to [[Financial security and wealth creation | financial security and wealth creation]] often lies outside traditional advice.

## Challenging Money Myths: The Home as a Liability
One prevalent money myth is the idea that you cannot [[Building Wealth from Scratch | build wealth]] if you rent, or that owning your home is automatically a path to [[Financial Independence and Wealth Building | wealth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Singh clarifies that a personal residence should often be viewed as a liability, not an asset, due to various expenses and the way mortgages are structured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

> "Your house is actually a money pit and that's why I want you to think of your house as a liability." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>

Key points about homeownership from this perspective:
*   **"Generational Wealth" is a Myth** Your home, even if it appreciates, doesn't provide liquid cash unless you borrow against it (creating new debt) or sell it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Passing down a house means passing on its ongoing costs like property tax, insurance, and maintenance to your children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.
*   **Mortgage Front-Loading** Banks structure 30-year mortgages so that for the first nearly 15 years, the majority of your payment goes towards interest, not principal or equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. Refinancing restarts this cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   **Opportunity Cost** The capital used for a down payment could instead be invested in cash-generating assets like rental properties, [[investment_strategies_real_estate_stocks_and_more | stocks]], or a business, which might offer greater growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.
*   **Renting vs. Owning** Renting is not inherently "throwing money away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. Just as you pay a restaurant owner or hotel owner, paying rent means you are making a landlord rich, but you are also gaining flexibility and avoiding significant costs and risks associated with homeownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. Singh himself rents his home and office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.
*   **Affordability** To truly afford a house, one must consider the down payment (ideally 20% to avoid PMI), monthly payments, and moving costs (movers, furniture, upgrades) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

## [[Wealth Building Strategies | Alternative Wealth-Building Strategies]]
Instead of traditional homeownership, Singh advocates for investing in assets that generate cash flow or appreciate significantly. The three main avenues for [[Wealth Building Strategies | building wealth]] over the last century have been:
1.  Starting a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
2.  Investing in [[investment_strategies_real_estate_stocks_and_more | real estate]] (specifically income-generating properties) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
3.  Investing in [[investment_strategies_real_estate_stocks_and_more | stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>

### Jaspreet Singh's Personal Journey and Investment Philosophy
Singh's journey began by playing a Punjabi drum at Indian weddings, which led him to host teen parties in high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This evolved into a party promotion and event planning company in college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This experience taught him a crucial lesson: "I don't need a license or degree to make money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

At 19, while studying for medical school, he began reading about money and learned the difference between assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. An asset puts money in your pocket, while a liability takes money out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. His first [[investment_strategies_real_estate_stocks_and_more | real estate]] investment was a foreclosed condo purchased for $8,000, which he renovated and rented out for $600 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This cash flow-generating asset proved more valuable than traditional career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

Singh invests his money in five key areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:19">[00:50:19]</a>:
*   **His own business** (Briefs Media) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>.
*   **Physical [[investment_strategies_real_estate_stocks_and_more | real estate]]** (rental properties for cash flow), making up almost 50% of his investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>. He targets a minimum 7% cash-on-cash return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. He uses property managers for passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.
*   **[[investment_strategies_real_estate_stocks_and_more | Stocks]]** (individual companies and ETFs/index funds), about 30% of his portfolio, split roughly 50/50 between the two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>.
*   **Speculative assets** (startups and cryptocurrency), which make up a smaller 18% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>. He views crypto as a speculative investment due to its volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>.
*   **Physical gold** (about 2% of his portfolio) as a hedge against currency devaluation and economic instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>.

### Financial Discipline: The 75/15/10 Plan
Singh suggests a simple [[Wealth Building Strategies | wealth building strategy]] to manage income: the 75/15/10 plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>. For every dollar earned:
*   **75 cents** is the maximum you can spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.
*   **15 cents** is the minimum you invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.
*   **10 cents** is the minimum you save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.

This system helps control spending and prioritize [[Financial Independence and Wealth Building | financial security and wealth creation]], regardless of income level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. The speaker highlights that 78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, spending everything they earn or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. This often results from a credit-based economy that encourages spending beyond means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

## [[The psychology of money and building wealth | The Money Mindset]] and [[Mindset and personal development in wealth creation | Personal Development]]
[[The psychology of money and building wealth | Building wealth]] starts with the right [[mindset_and_personal_development_in_wealth_creation | mindset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>. Singh outlines four key aspects of the "Money Mindset":
1.  **"I will become wealthy."** You must believe you are worthy of [[Building Wealth from Scratch | wealth]] and that it is achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>. Societal stereotypes and upbringing often create "invisible barriers" that prevent people from even dreaming big <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>. Breaking out of this "invisible box" is crucial for innovation and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:46">[01:03:46]</a>.
2.  **Money is a Tool.** Money itself is neutral; it amplifies who you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. Financial fitness is one of four essential "fitnesses" (physical, mental, spiritual, financial) that enable a happy and fulfilled life. Lacking financial fitness can negatively impact the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>.
3.  **Money is Abundant.** The belief that money is scarce is often learned in childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a>. In reality, there is ample money in the world, and one person's [[Building Wealth from Scratch | wealth]] does not preclude another's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:07">[01:20:07]</a>. This mindset encourages focusing on earning more rather than solely on cutting expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>.
4.  **It is my Duty to Become Wealthy.** Taking personal responsibility for your [[Financial security and wealth creation | financial security and wealth creation]] is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>. Relying on government or others often leads to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>. The economic system is designed to profit from financial illiteracy, making it crucial to educate yourself and take charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:26">[01:44:26]</a>.

## Retirement Crisis and the Power of Investing
The UK and US face a retirement crisis, where a large population of retirees lacks sufficient savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:32">[01:54:32]</a>. The average American needs $1.8 million to retire comfortably, according to USA Today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:18">[01:56:18]</a>. Social Security and pensions are often insufficient, making personal savings and [[Financial Independence and Wealth Building | investments]] critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:08">[02:00:08]</a>.

Singh defines retirement not as a fixed age but as a state of [[Financial Independence and Wealth Building | wealth]] where "my cash flow from my [[Financial Independence and Wealth Building | investments]] exceeds my expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:39">[02:03:39]</a>. To achieve this, you must acquire assets that generate cash flow, such as dividend-paying [[investment_strategies_real_estate_stocks_and_more | stocks]] or [[investment_strategies_real_estate_stocks_and_more | real estate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:54">[02:05:54]</a>.

Inflation benefits investors, as [[Financial Independence and Wealth Building | investment]] values (like stock market returns and rental prices) tend to grow faster than incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:11">[02:07:11]</a>. For example, between 2019-2024, median household income grew by 18%, while the S&P 500 grew by almost 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:29">[02:07:29]</a>. This highlights why you "can't earn your way to [[Building Wealth from Scratch | wealth]]; you can't save your way to [[Building Wealth from Scratch | wealth]]; you have to invest your way to [[Building Wealth from Scratch | wealth]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:01">[02:08:01]</a>.

## The Importance of Self-Investment and Patience
The best [[Financial security and wealth creation | investment]], according to Singh, is in yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:04">[01:30:04]</a>. This includes:
*   **Education:** Reading books, listening to podcasts, taking classes, and seeking coaching outside of formal schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:21">[01:30:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:50">[02:20:50]</a>.
*   **Learning from Failures:** Mistakes are inevitable and provide invaluable lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:33">[01:30:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:55">[01:31:55]</a>.
*   **Patience:** [[Wealth Building Strategies | Building wealth]] through [[Financial Independence and Wealth Building | investing]] is often a "boring and patient" long-term strategy, rather than chasing quick wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:13">[02:16:13]</a>.

## Becoming an Entrepreneur
While not for everyone, entrepreneurship is a powerful [[Wealth Building Strategies | wealth building strategy]] for the right person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. The "right person" has an entrepreneurial itch, a desire to create, a tolerance for uncertainty, a willingness to work hard (beyond 9-5), and the ability to tolerate criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:07">[02:12:07]</a>.

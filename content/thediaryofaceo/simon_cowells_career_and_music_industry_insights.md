[[Simon Cowells worklife balance and mental health | Simon Cowell]] is a prominent figure whose influence has significantly altered the landscape of television and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. His career is marked by staggering success, numerous challenges, and a distinctive approach to the entertainment industry.

## Early Life and Career Foundations

Born into a happy childhood, Simon frequently experienced boredom at school, longing for a life that was interesting and fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. He was determined to find a career he would enjoy and began making his own money from a young age, by washing cars and mowing lawns in his neighborhood to earn spending money for family holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

### Parental Influence
Simon's parents, Julie and Eric, were profoundly influential. His mother, Julie, was the disciplinarian who instilled in him the importance of manners with the phrase "manners maketh the man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. His father, Eric, imparted crucial advice, including the importance of patience in building a career, noting it could take "20 years" or "30 years" to achieve success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

A key piece of advice from his father, which stuck with him since age 12, was that "everyone in life Simon has a sign on their head and it says make me feel important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. This taught him the value of recognizing and appreciating every person on a team, from the most junior staff to senior executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. This philosophy is reflected in his interactions, as he is known to greet and take interest in every person in a room, unlike many public figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. He actively avoids the hypocrisy he's observed in others who act differently off-camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:07]</a>.

### Developing a Work Ethic and Early Jobs
Simon's renowned "insane work ethic" stems largely from his father's experience of being retired from a large corporation at 65 without ongoing recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. This made Simon determined to work for himself and avoid a similar fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. He also felt a strong aversion to working for a boss who might dislike him, a sentiment influenced by his strict teachers and poor academic performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

At around 12, Simon expressed an interest in entertainment, despite not excelling in music or playing instruments himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. His passion originated from collecting records and the excitement of listening to new albums in his bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.

After struggling with traditional jobs like a trainee at Tesco (where he clashed with an interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>), the Civil Service, and the building trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>, he found his "sliding doors moment" as a runner at Elstree Studios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>. Although his contract was short-lived and he faced a "mean" executive producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:00">[15:44:00]</a>, this experience reaffirmed his desire to be in the entertainment industry.

He then took a job in the post room at EMI Music Publishing at age 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>. Despite the low pay (£18 a week) and initial rejection for promotions, he used the opportunity to relentlessly ask questions and learn about how the entire company functioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>. This curiosity allowed him to glimpse the significant earnings of artists like Kate Bush, motivating his career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Ventures and Setbacks

After 18 months in the post room, without a promotion, Simon briefly became an estate agent, a job he "hated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. His father, aware of his unhappiness, intervened, leading to an opening in the international department of EMI Music Publishing as a song plugger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>. This role, focused on licensing country music in the UK, was challenging due to the genre's unpopularity and initial hostility from colleagues who felt he got the job unfairly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:25:00">[23:25:00]</a>. Simon isolated himself, listening to thousands of songs, which enabled him to successfully get many covered by other artists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>.

His first attempt at starting a music publishing company, Ellis & Simon, with a boss from EMI, failed. Their office was in an NCP car park, described as a former "Lou" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:00">[25:52:00]</a>.

### Fanfare Records and Financial Ruin
Undeterred, Simon started his own record label, Fanfare Records, at around 24 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a>. His first major project was with Sanita, whom he met in a club <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:53:00">[27:53:00]</a>. Despite not knowing how records were made or being able to read music, he instinctively believed in her potential and the concept for a dance track called "So Macho" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>. He deliberately avoided learning the technicalities of music production to maintain the perspective of a consumer, not a creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:55:00">[31:55:00]</a>.

Fanfare Records ultimately collapsed, leaving Simon personally owing the bank £500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:30:00">[37:30:00]</a>. This was due to encouragement from his bank manager to buy shares in the company, which then crashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:47:00">[37:47:00]</a>. He lost his house and Porsche, moving back in with his parents at age 30 with just £5 in his pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:07:00">[38:07:00]</a>. His parents were incredibly supportive, viewing it as a "life lesson" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:32:00">[39:32:00]</a>. He managed to negotiate his debt down and secured a new bank loan, avoiding bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00:00">[40:00:00]</a>. His lawyer, Tony Russell, was instrumental during this period, offering support and belief in Simon's future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>.

## Music Industry Insights and Success

Simon describes meeting [[liams_experiences_with_entrepreneurship_and_investment | Peter Waterman]] as the most important day of his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:38:00">[44:38:00]</a>. Waterman, a highly successful pop writer and producer, initially refused to work on Sanita's follow-up hit. Simon persevered, frequently turning up at Waterman's studio, making tea, and observing for a year and a half until Waterman eventually agreed to produce "Toy Boy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:41:00">[46:41:00]</a>. Waterman's skill lay in his ability to intuitively understand what records would resonate with an audience, making complex processes seem simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:51:00">[47:51:00]</a>.

### The Power of Television and Unconventional Thinking
Upon joining BMG, Simon focused on television as an unusual distribution platform for music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:23:00">[48:23:00]</a>. He recognized that dedicated fanbases, like those of American wrestlers (WWF), would purchase albums if music was attached to their interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:03:00">[49:03:03]</a>. Despite strong opposition and even begging from his boss not to pursue it, he created a successful album with wrestlers, and later with Power Rangers and Zig and Zag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:07:00">[50:07:00]</a>. This demonstrated his ability to see opportunities others missed by thinking from first principles and adopting the consumer's perspective, rather than adhering to industry conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:31:00">[50:31:00]</a>. These albums sold millions of copies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:55:00">[52:55:00]</a>.

He cultivated relationships with tele-sales staff at BMG, viewing them as "punters" who understood market demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:14:00">[53:14:00]</a>. This led him to discover the popularity of Robson & Jerome, whom he aggressively pursued (even receiving a legal letter for harassment) until they agreed to record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:08:00">[54:08:00]</a>. Their single became a massive hit, cementing Simon's belief in trusting his gut and pursuing unconventional paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:10:00">[56:10:00]</a>.

### Advice for Aspiring Artists and Entrepreneurs
Simon advises aspiring artists to "make noise amongst the noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:55:00">[58:55:00]</a>. He encourages finding a unique approach, like re-arranging cover songs, rather than simply copying originals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:02:00">[59:02:00]</a>. He believes it is better to be "mocked for being different than being safe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>, acknowledging that overcoming skepticism and criticism is part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>.

If the conventional path is closed, he suggests finding an alternative route to achieve goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>. He also highlights the importance of finding mentors: "Being smart is finding the person who is smarter than you who is willing to take you under their wing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:09">[01:48:09]</a>. However, he stresses that one must be prepared to "put the work in" to earn that mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:26">[01:48:26]</a>.

## Personal Challenges and Evolution

### Loss and Depression
The loss of his parents, particularly his mother, was the "most devastating thing" in Simon's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. He described his father's death as a "Bittersweet time" coinciding with Westlife's album reaching number one, and admitted he would have "swapped everything" to have him around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>. He believes in the continued presence of his parents and often asks himself "what would my dad say" when faced with decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>. The death of his father also changed his perspective, making material things seem "meaningless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>.

Following his mother's passing, Simon entered a "downward spiral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:44">[01:15:44]</a>. He became a "ridiculous workaholic," working until 7 or 8 AM and waking in the afternoon, addicted to the intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. He suffered from depression and wasn't happy, despite his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>. He describes this period as dark, feeling as if "being alive doesn't matter anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>. He is open about suffering from depression at times and emphasizes the importance of talking about mental health, especially for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.

### The Impact of Fatherhood and Work-Life Balance
The birth of his son, Eric, "changed everything" and made him "happy again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:36">[01:17:36]</a>. Eric "saved" him, pulling him out of a period where "nothing mattered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>. This shift led to significant changes in [[Simon Cowells worklife balance and mental health | Simon Cowell's work-life balance]]. He now prioritizes family above all else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:37">[01:50:37]</a>.

He has implemented boundaries, such as not engaging with emails after 5:30/6:00 PM and not working Fridays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>. Notably, he doesn't own a mobile phone, finding them "boring" and preferring in-person conversations or landlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:26">[01:23:26]</a>. He believes not having a phone helps him focus on "important things" and avoid "gossip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:30">[01:25:30]</a>.

He advises other workaholics to evaluate where their efforts are truly worthwhile, acknowledging that sustained creativity requires being well-rested and happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:34">[01:27:34]</a>. He advocates for good sleep, stating it's the "best medicine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:12">[01:31:12]</a>. While recognizing that hard work and putting in hours are essential for success, he stresses the importance of not "killing yourself in the process" once a "groove" is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:38">[01:30:38]</a>.

### Accident and Therapy
In 2020, Simon suffered a severe electric motorbike accident, breaking his back in three places and requiring a six-hour surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>. He was "very lucky to be alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:11">[01:32:11]</a>. The difficult recovery, combined with the pandemic, led him to begin therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:53">[01:36:53]</a>.

Therapy provided a much-needed "release" for bottled-up emotions and helped him to reorder his life priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:17">[01:39:17]</a>. He emphasizes that seeking help is a strength, not a weakness, and encourages others to consider it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:39">[01:39:39]</a>. His therapist, Justin, is credited with helping him simplify his thinking and significantly impacting his well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:02">[01:42:02]</a>.

## Reflections on Success and Legacy

[[Simons thoughts on success challenges and the future of music | Simon's thoughts on success challenges and the future of music]] include the understanding that true happiness comes from enjoying what you do and pursuing your passion, not from material wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:11">[01:44:11]</a>. He has experienced both wealth and being broke, noting that he was happiest when broke and unhappiest at times when wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:59">[01:43:59]</a>. He emphasizes the excitement of Monday mornings when you love your work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:16">[01:44:16]</a>.

He acknowledges that his approach to career has been untraditional, often involving "forcing" things to happen when conventional routes were blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. He embraces the thrill that new ventures "may not work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.

Simon's ultimate legacy, particularly for his son Eric, is about achieving success "without a head start" and "treated people well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. He has a strong belief in liking people and never refuses a request for a picture or autograph, remembering his own disappointment as a child when refused an autograph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:19">[01:49:19]</a>.

### Perspective on One Direction and Future of Music
Simon is friends with some of the One Direction boys, including [[liams_experiences_with_entrepreneurship and investment | Liam]], who has spoken about the struggles that come with extreme fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:22">[01:52:22]</a>. Simon believes that if artists want success, they must accept the accompanying loss of privacy, long hours, and constant public attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:42">[01:53:42]</a>. He views being in a band as a more enjoyable and easier way to gain notice, often serving as a catalyst for solo careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:03">[01:55:03]</a>. He regrets not owning the One Direction name, which prevents a reunion tour unless all members agree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:12">[02:07:12]</a>. He plans to search for a new boy band, documenting the entire process, as he feels there hasn't been a band as good as One Direction since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:30">[01:55:30]</a>.

Regarding AI, Simon sees it as both a concern and an opportunity, but believes the "real thing" will always be preferred in entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:10">[02:03:10]</a>. He agrees with the idea that people's demand for real, in-person entertainment and experiences will surge in an increasingly digital world, similar to how vinyl records have become popular again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:49">[02:03:49]</a>.

His single most positive decision for long-term impact on his life is "don't eat sugar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:49">[02:08:49]</a>.

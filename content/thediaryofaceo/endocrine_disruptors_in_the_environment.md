[[Endocrine disruptors and reproductive health | Endocrine disruptors]] are chemicals found in the environment that can drive [[Hormonal influences on weight gain and obesity | weight gain]] and other health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. These chemicals "mimic endogenous signals to our body" and instruct different tissues to behave in ways they should not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>.

## Obesogens

A specific type of [[Endocrine disruptors and reproductive health | endocrine disruptor]] is an "obesogen," which are chemicals that specifically cause [[Hormonal influences on weight gain and obesity | weight gain]] by driving the differentiation or growth of fat cells, independent of calories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.

### Examples of Obesogens and Their Sources

*   **DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane)**: Although banned in the U.S. in 1972, its metabolite DDE can still be measured in pregnant women's urine today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. The level of DDE in a pregnant woman can predict obesity in her offspring 11 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>.
*   **PFAS (Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) / Teflon**: This "forever chemical" was used to coat non-stick pans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>. It can cause obesity on its own by driving the differentiation and growth of fat cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:53]</a>.
*   **Tributyltin (TBT)**: Used in boat paint to prevent barnacles, this chemical is present in our food and water supply globally and causes fat cells to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **BPA (Bisphenol A)**: Found in paper receipts from stores like Target and the white lining inside canned foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:24">[01:13:24]</a>. BPA acts as an estrogen, which causes fat deposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.
*   **Phthalates**: These plasticizers are found in items like pacifiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a> and contribute to obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>.
*   **Parabens**: Found in cosmetics, parabens can cause obesity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:43">[01:13:43]</a>.
*   **Vinyl Flooring and Flame Retardants**: These are present in many household items, including children's clothing and mattresses, and can drive the differentiation and growth of fat cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

## Health Impacts

Exposure to these [[Endocrine disruptors and reproductive health | endocrine disruptors]] is linked to a range of health issues:
*   **[[Hormonal influences on weight gain and obesity | Weight gain]] and Obesity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>
*   **Fat Cell Differentiation and Growth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>
*   **Decreased Fertility and Changes in Reproductive Capacity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:41">[01:15:41]</a>
*   **Neurocognition and Brain Development** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a> (linked topic: [[The impact of lifestyle and environment on brain health | the_impact_of_lifestyle_and_environment_on_brain_health]])
*   **Potential Role in Autism** (though not yet proven) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>

## Exposure and Mitigation

[[Toxic chemicals in everyday products | Toxic chemicals in everyday products]] acting as [[Endocrine disruptors and reproductive health | endocrine disruptors]] are pervasive in our environment.
*   It is difficult to escape exposure to air pollution or "forever chemicals" like Teflon and tributyltin in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>.
*   While tap water may be a concern, some bottled waters can also contain obesogens, potentially from the bottle itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>.

### Strategies to Reduce Exposure

While societal changes through regulation are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:34">[01:16:34]</a>, individuals can take some [[Strategies to reduce exposure to environmental toxins | actions]]:
*   **Choose fresh, whole foods** over ultra-processed options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:35">[01:46:35]</a>.
*   **Wash produce** to remove pesticides, which can be environmental obesogens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.
*   **Be aware of packaging**: Canned foods lined with white interiors may contain BPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>.

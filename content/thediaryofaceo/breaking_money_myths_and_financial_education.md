Many prevailing "money myths" prevent individuals from building wealth. These include the beliefs that wealth cannot be built if one rents their home, or that access to millions of dollars is required to start building wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In reality, some investments have yielded better returns than real estate, stocks, or even cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. [[Financial security and wealth creation | True wealth]] can be achieved by understanding how money works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## The Problem: Lack of Financial Education

A significant issue is the widespread lack of [[importance_of_financial_education | financial education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. People are often taught to study hard, get a good job, and expect success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. However, this traditional path often leads to financial struggles, with 78% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### The "Scared to Look Broke" Trap
Ironically, a key reason many people remain poor is the fear of appearing broke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This leads to spending money on liabilities like expensive cars, vacations, and dining out, leaving no funds for saving or investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This phenomenon is known as being "fake rich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>. Spending decisions are often emotional, driven by a desire for dopamine hits or to alleviate misery, which can lead to reckless spending and falling for get-rich-quick schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.

### Why Money Matters
Money is an integral part of daily life, costing money to eat and feed others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Neglecting to understand money can lead to higher taxes, struggles with bills, and limitations on lifestyle and family well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. In our economic system, "money talks," and understanding it is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## The Path to [[Financial Independence and Wealth Building | Wealth]]

The fundamental difference between wealthy and non-wealthy individuals is their understanding of how money works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Wealthy people focus on owning assets that generate income, rather than just earning a salary or climbing the corporate ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

Historically, the three main ways to build wealth have been:
1.  Starting a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
2.  Investing in real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
3.  Investing in stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>

### Jaspreet Singh's Journey
Jaspreet Singh, a financial guru and entrepreneur, initially followed the traditional path, pursuing a career as a doctor and then an attorney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. However, he realized that formal education did not teach him about building wealth, investing, or passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. His "penny drop" moment came when he started a party promotion business in college, realizing he didn't need a license or degree to make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

He then learned the difference between an asset (something that puts money in your pocket) and a liability (something that takes money out of your pocket) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. At 19, inspired by books on wealth, he bought his first investment property – a condo out of foreclosure for $8,000, rented it for $600/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This experience showed him the power of assets generating income without trading time for dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. This realization made him angry that this financial knowledge was not taught in traditional education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

### Debunking the Homeownership Myth
Contrary to popular belief, buying a personal home for residence is often a liability, not an asset, because it takes money out of your pocket through mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. While owning a home free and clear is great, it's not a cash-generating asset like a rental property where rent covers expenses and provides cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. Banks "front-load" mortgages, meaning the majority of early payments go to interest, not equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

Buying a house ties up capital, leading to [[the_psychology_of_money_and_building_wealth | opportunity cost]] – the lost opportunity to invest that money in assets like rental properties, stocks, or businesses that could generate better returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. Renting is not necessarily "throwing money away"; it frees up capital for investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.

## Practical Financial Strategies

### The Financial Danger Zone
If an individual doesn't have at least $2,000 saved for emergencies and carries credit card debt, they are in the "financial danger zone" and need to make drastic changes immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This includes cutting unnecessary spending like dining out, vacations, and even excessive TV watching, to free up time and money for learning and earning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.

### The 75/15/10 Plan
A simple rule of thumb for [[financial_habits_and_personal_finance_rules | financial habits]] is the 75/15/10 plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>:
*   **75%** maximum allowed for spending (including mortgage if applicable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>
*   **15%** minimum to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>
*   **10%** minimum to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>

This plan helps control spending and ensures consistent saving and investing, regardless of income level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.

### Getting Out of the Paycheck-to-Paycheck Cycle
To break free from living paycheck to paycheck, individuals must make themselves rich before making others rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. This means stopping the "bleeding" of money through excessive spending. Practical steps include:
*   Selling unused possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>
*   Selling unaffordable assets (car, house) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>
*   Downgrading living situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>
*   Working to earn more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>

This often requires sacrifice and difficult choices, especially when social pressures encourage spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.

## The Money Mindset

A crucial aspect of wealth building is developing the right [[the_psychology_of_money_and_spending_behavior | money mindset]]. This involves several key components:

1.  **"I will become wealthy."** Believing in one's ability to achieve wealth is the first step; without this belief, it is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>. This often means breaking through "invisible barriers" or stereotype threats ingrained from upbringing and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
2.  **Money is a tool.** Money is neutral; it amplifies who a person is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. Financial fitness is one of four essential "fitnesses" for a happy and fulfilled life (physical, mental, spiritual, financial) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>.
3.  **Money is abundant.** Understanding that there is a vast amount of money in the world helps shift focus from scarcity (squeezing pennies) to abundance (earning more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>. One person's wealth does not diminish another's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>.
4.  **"It is my duty to become wealthy."** Individuals should take responsibility for their financial well-being and that of their families, rather than relying on external sources like government programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52">[01:22:52]</a>.

## Investment Portfolio and Strategy

Jaspreet Singh invests his money in five places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:02">[01:26:02]</a>:
1.  **Own Business (Briefs Media)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:34">[01:50:34]</a>
2.  **Physical Real Estate (rental properties)**: Approximately 50% of his investments, focused on generating cash flow (e.g., 7% cash-on-cash return minimum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>. He uses property managers for passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:39">[01:29:39]</a>.
3.  **Stocks**: About 30% of his portfolio, split between individual companies and ETFs/index funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a>.
4.  **Speculative Assets**: Around 18% of his portfolio, including startups and cryptocurrency. These are small parts of his portfolio due to their high risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:10">[01:53:10]</a>.
5.  **Physical Gold**: About 2% of his portfolio, viewed as a way of saving "hard money" and insurance against economic collapse, not an investment that produces cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:09">[01:54:09]</a>.

He also maintains separate cash buckets for emergency savings (personal and business) and money waiting to be invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

### Patience in Investing
Despite the allure of quick returns, a "boring and patient" approach to investing is often the most effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:53">[02:16:53]</a>. Historically, the stock market has returned an average of 10% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:30">[02:17:30]</a>. Trying to "beat the market" through trading or hot tips driven by emotion often leads to losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>. Consistent investment, even small amounts like $100 a month from age 21 to 65, can lead to millionaire status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:18">[02:19:18]</a>.

## Addressing the Retirement Crisis

Many countries, including the US and UK, face a retirement crisis due to a large, aging population with insufficient savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:32">[01:54:32]</a>. The average American age 60 has only $500,000 saved, while comfortably retiring requires $1.8 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:47">[01:55:47]</a>. Social Security and pensions are unreliable for comfortable retirement, leaving personal savings and investments as the critical third leg of the stool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:08">[02:00:08]</a>.

### Redefining Retirement
Traditional retirement (stopping work at 65-67) can lead to a loss of purpose and health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:06">[02:02:06]</a>. Instead, Jaspreet defines [[financial_freedom_and_entrepreneurship | wealth]] and retirement as when "cash flow from investments exceeds expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:42">[02:03:42]</a>. This allows for financial freedom at any age, enabling one to pursue passions without financial worry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:25">[02:04:25]</a>.

## The Best Investment: Yourself

The single best investment anyone can make is in themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:04">[01:30:04]</a>. This includes:
*   **Education outside of school**: Reading books, listening to podcasts, taking classes, and coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:21">[01:30:21]</a>. Recommended foundational books include *Rich Dad Poor Dad* by Robert Kiyosaki, *The Total Money Makeover* by Dave Ramsey, and *The Creature from Jekyll Island* by G. Edward Griffin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:59">[02:20:59]</a>.
*   **Learning from failures**: Mistakes, though stressful and costly, provide invaluable lessons that lead to growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:40">[01:30:40]</a>.
*   **Taking responsibility**: Taking personal responsibility for financial outcomes, rather than blaming external factors, is a key indicator of future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:06">[01:43:06]</a>.
*   **Not being cheap**: Being cheap often leads to greater long-term costs (e.g., hiring a cheap accountant who makes expensive errors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:08">[01:37:08]</a>. Investing in high-quality people and services can yield significant returns.
*   **Cultivating an internal locus of control**: Believing that one controls their decisions and outcomes, rather than external forces, empowers action and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:49">[01:43:49]</a>.

## Final Thoughts on Wealth Creation

### The Economic System
The economic system is designed to benefit investors, and corporations, banks, and governments often profit from financial illiteracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>. Understanding this system is crucial to learn how to use it to one's advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:27">[01:45:27]</a>. Tax laws, for example, reward investors with lower tax rates compared to employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>. Wealthy individuals like Elon Musk often avoid traditional salaries, instead borrowing against their assets to fund their lifestyle, thereby avoiding income tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:07">[01:50:07]</a>.

### You Can't Earn Your Way to Wealth, You Invest Your Way to Wealth
Income growth is significantly slower than investment growth. Between 2019 and 2024, median household income grew by 18%, while the S&P 500 grew by almost 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:32">[02:07:32]</a>. Over five decades (1971-2021), household income increased by 600%, while the S&P 500 grew by 4,000% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:16">[02:08:16]</a>. This demonstrates that inflation benefits investors, underscoring the necessity of investing to build wealth and achieve financial independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:06">[02:09:06]</a>.

### Wealth Preservation
Beyond wealth creation, preserving and protecting wealth is vital. This involves strategic accounting and tax planning, legal structures for businesses and investments, various forms of insurance, and comprehensive estate planning to manage wealth after death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:54">[02:22:54]</a>.

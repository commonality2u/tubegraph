From: [[DwarkeshPatel]] <br/> 
In a recent discussion on the Lunar Society Podcast, Sarah Fitzgerald, a writer and speaker well-known for her educational philosophy "Taking Children Seriously," challenges the conventional views on children's rights and education. Fitzgerald advocates for a [[noncoercive_education_philosophy | non-coercive approach]], positing that children are inherently [[rationality_and_creativity_in_children | creative and rational]] beings who should be treated with the same respect and autonomy as adults. This article delves into her arguments and explores how conventional practices could be reimagined.

## Taking Children Seriously: An Overview

Sarah Fitzgerald's educational philosophy argues for the [[noncoercive_education_philosophy | non-coercive treatment of children]]. She asserts that children, like adults, are fallible and possess the capability for rational thought from birth. The current societal treatment of children is reminiscent of the patriarchal views that once dominated attitudes toward women and minority groups, where these groups were seen as needing guidance through authoritarian control (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>).

> Coercion is seen as causing someone to act against their will, an approach Fitzgerald considers detrimental to resolving issues rationally. She believes coercion implies that "might makes right," which is fallacious (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>).

## Children as Creative and Rational Beings

Fitzgerald contends that [[rationality_and_creativity_in_children | rationality and creativity]] are not traits that emerge only in adulthood; rather, children exhibit these qualities from a very early age. She challenges the notion that children are inherently less capable decision-makers, arguing for their right to participate in decisions about their own lives (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>).

This perspective presents a striking departure from how society typically regards the abilities of children compared to adults. She makes a parallel between how society once viewed women and minority groups as incapable of handling their affairs autonomously and how children are currently perceived (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>).

## The Problem with Conventional Schooling

Fitzgerald is especially critical of the traditional schooling system, which she sees as an authoritarian institution that stifles children's natural creativity and problem-solving abilities. The current educational model, she suggests, is outdated, modeled to create obedient factory workers rather than innovative thinkers [[criticism_of_the_mandatory_schooling_system | (criticism of the mandatory schooling system)]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>).

She argues against the idea that a coercive schooling system is necessary to impart basic knowledge, stating that genuine learning happens when children are engaged and interested [[impact_of_coercion_on_child_development | (impact of coercion on child development)]] (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>).

## Addressing Counterarguments

Critics often argue that children require coercion to learn discipline and essential life skills that prepare them for adult responsibilities. However, Fitzgerald responds that true self-discipline comes not from coercion but from the pursuit of one’s passions. When a child follows their interests, they naturally develop the skills needed to succeed (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>).

## Moving Beyond Coercion

Fitzgerald suggests that by abandoning coercive tactics, children can grow up in an environment that fosters genuine curiosity and creativity. The conventional approach often leads to a loss of interest in learning as children grow older—a trend she attributes to the stifling nature of coercive education (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>).

## The Future of Children's Rights

Fitzgerald envisions a future where children are seen as autonomous individuals capable of contributing meaningfully to decisions that affect their lives. She believes societal views on children will continue to evolve, much like views on gender and race have in the past century. This change, she speculates, may involve rethinking many established norms, including child labor laws and other consent regulations, to better align with a new understanding of childhood autonomy (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>).

## Conclusion

The discussion with Sarah Fitzgerald presents a compelling case for re-evaluating how society views and treats children's rights. Her philosophy challenges long-held beliefs and practices, advocating for a shift towards recognizing children as full participants in their development. Through empathy and respect for their inherent [[rationality_and_creativity_in_children | rationality and creativity]], she posits, we can foster their growth into innovative adults who can contribute more significantly to society's progress.

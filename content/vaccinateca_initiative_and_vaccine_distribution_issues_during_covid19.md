During the early rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in 2021, significant challenges emerged in providing the public with clear, centralized information on vaccine availability. This led to the creation of VaccinateCA, a volunteer-driven initiative, to address a critical gap left by institutional failures.

## Origins and Purpose

In early 2021, individuals faced immense difficulty in finding pharmacies with COVID-19 vaccines in stock, often making 20, 40, or even 60 phone calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Patrick McKenzie (also known as patio11) tweeted about the absurdity of every person or caregiver attempting to contact every medical provider in California to find doses, suggesting that a centralized website was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. He offered to cover server costs if someone built such a site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Karl Yang accepted the challenge around 10:00 p.m. California time, gathering ten friends with the goal of open-sourcing vaccine availability information by the next morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. McKenzie joined their Discord server, offering advice on scaled calling operations, and eventually became the CEO of the initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

What began as a hackathon project by tech volunteers aiming to help people find vaccines "at the margin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> grew significantly. VaccinateCA ultimately became a public-private partnership serving as the clearinghouse for vaccine location information for the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. McKenzie estimates the initiative probably saved a "high four-figure number of lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. If one Googled for the vaccine before a certain day, there was no answer; after that day, the answer often came from VaccinateCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>.

## Funding

The total budget for VaccinateCA was $1.2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. McKenzie highlighted the disparity between the ease of raising funds for for-profit tech ventures and the difficulty faced by this critical public health initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>.
He noted that if he were raising a seed round for a for-profit company, he could likely secure $8 million quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>, but VaccinateCA struggled to raise its much smaller budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.

Fundraising experiences varied:
*   One tech CEO, emailed at 4:30 p.m., personally committed $100,000 by 9:30 a.m. the next day, with the wire clearing the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.
*   Other potential tech funders had processes that took six weeks, by which time (May 2021) they perceived the vaccine supply problem as largely solved for the "professional managerial class," failing to recognize ongoing logistical issues and needs for underserved populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. Some funders suggested redirecting efforts to other nations, which VaccinateCA felt unqualified to do effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.
*   To cover initial, urgent expenses like purchasing a commercial database of hospital information ($2,000) rather than spending hours scraping it, McKenzie provided his business debit card with a $10,000 limit, emphasizing speed over bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>.
*   The last $100,000 contributed to the project came from McKenzie's daughter's college education fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. This became necessary because some who had "soft committed" funds did not follow through, and McKenzie chose to cover the final payroll himself rather than fail to pay the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>. This money was not recovered and became a personal donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.

After McKenzie published an article about VaccinateCA, some Effective Altruist (EA) funders expressed regret for not funding the project, stating they had written larger checks for less promising ventures. McKenzie hadn't approached them initially due to confidence in his existing network and being overwhelmed with operational demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.

# Systemic Failures in U.S. Vaccine Distribution

The need for VaccinateCA highlighted significant shortcomings in the official U.S. response to distributing COVID-19 vaccines.

## Lack of Centralized Information and Responsibility

A core problem was the absence of a centralized system for vaccine information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. No single actor—including county public health departments, governors' offices, or two presidential administrations—claimed full responsibility for ensuring people could find and receive vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Many entities acknowledged a narrow role but expected someone else to handle the "hard work" of logistics and putting shots in arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This resulted in the "ball being dropped comprehensively" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Governmental Inaction and Software Aversion

The federal government, in particular, seemed to have learned the "wrong lesson" from the Healthcare.gov rollout for Obamacare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The fear that a president's legacy could be doomed by tech failures led to an institutional decision to avoid taking ownership of software problems, even in critical situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Despite software being integral to modern competence, the U.S. federal government largely abdicated software as a core responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The complexity of the U.S. governmental system, with multiple distinct supply chains and technological systems for tracking vials, further complicated matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Attempts to commission consultancies to integrate these systems largely failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## Tech Industry Hesitancy

Large tech companies (referred to as "AppAmaGooFaSoft" or "AppAmaGooBookSoft") also refrained from building a centralized vaccine finder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This was partly due to political pressure following the January 6th events, with internal directives to "not get in the newspaper for any reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Public health teams within these companies, who recognized the need, were reportedly overruled due to fears that the tech industry appearing "better at the government's job than the government is" would be politically damaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

This reluctance was also linked to the "Copenhagen Principle of Culpability": if a tech company built a solution, they might be held responsible for the entirety of the U.S. vaccination effort's shortcomings, including issues like localization or demographic disparities in vaccination rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. There was a fear that success would lead to blame for not solving *every* related problem, or that embarrassing the government would invite retribution, drawing parallels to the Cambridge Analytica fallout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## Problematic Prioritization and Tiering Systems

The vaccine prioritization schedules were described as "byzantine and complicated," often befuddling even software engineers and health administrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. While initial tiers (e.g., 1A, 1B, 1C) were notionally based on medical necessity, they quickly became tools for "rewarding plums to politically favored groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

Examples from California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>:
*   **Tier 1A**: Initially for healthcare professionals and those over 75 (later changed to 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. It controversially included veterinarians, attributed to successful lobbying by the California Veterinarians Association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Tier definitions changed frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   **Tier 1B**: Included groups like school teachers, a decision influenced by the political power of teachers' unions, potentially prioritizing younger, at-home teachers over individuals at higher risk of death from COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
*   **Tier 1C**: For individuals deemed by doctors to be at high risk if they contracted COVID unvaccinated but not included in 1A or 1B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

This complex tiering led to significant bureaucratic hurdles. For instance, New York State commissioned a 57-page web application requiring multiple attachments for 75-year-olds to check eligibility—a task taxing even for tech professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. The perceived importance of strictly implementing this flawed tiering system took precedence over the primary goal of vaccinating people quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

## Inefficient Vaccine Administration and Waste

The focus on complex prioritization over efficient distribution had severe consequences. In January 2021, California reported successfully injecting only 25% of its allocated vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. There were even doubts about the accuracy of this low figure, with suggestions that incompetence in counting might have led to an undercount, though still far from optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>. This inefficiency contrasted sharply with pharmacies' routine ability to track vast inventories of other drugs accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.

The handling of **end-of-day shots** (vaccines from opened vials nearing expiration) further illustrated the dysfunction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.
*   Vials typically contained 5-10 doses and were considered unusable after about 12 hours post-opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
*   Initially, U.S. policy in some areas banned giving these expiring doses to anyone not fitting the current priority tier, with governors threatening prosecution and reputational damage to those who violated these rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. This was done to "protect the integrity of the tiering system" and promote "health equity," even if it meant throwing shots away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.
*   This contrasted with Israel's approach, where expiring doses were offered to anyone available, even by going out into the street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.
*   While the U.S. policy was eventually quietly reversed, the lack of a clear, public retraction led pharmacies to continue erring on the side of caution and discarding shots to avoid potential repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.
*   Some individual pharmacists, however, acted heroically, advising patients to get appointments under any pretext and then administering the vaccine without verifying eligibility, prioritizing their oath over the rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>.

## "Bike Shedding" and Misplaced Priorities

The intense focus on "equity strategy" in vaccine rollout discussions sometimes overshadowed operational necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. This was likened to "bike shedding," where people focus on trivial aspects (like the color of a bike shed) rather than complex core issues (like nuclear reactor design) because the former is easier to have an opinion on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. Many in the American professional managerial class, while not equipped to comment on server architecture or logistics, were well-versed in decrying systemic racism, leading discussions to disproportionately focus on equity frameworks rather than the mechanics of getting shots into arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. This was often done to the exclusion of operationalizing by medical necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

## Broader Institutional Decay and Lack of Seriousness

The failures were seen as symptomatic of a broader decay in institutional competence compared to historical efforts, such as vaccine campaigns during the 1918 flu pandemic by a "vastly less wealthy and less technologically sophisticated nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. There was a perceived "broad lack of seriousness" across government, civil society, and the tech industry in approaching the pandemic as a problem to be decisively won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

# Lack of Accountability and Public Discourse

Despite the significant issues and their life-or-death consequences, there has been a surprising lack of public outcry or sustained investigation into the vaccine distribution failures.

## "Memory-Holing" of Pandemic Issues

McKenzie suggests that many pandemic-related issues are being "memory-holed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This is attributed to:
*   **Political Incentives**: Particularly with an approaching election, there's little appetite to relitigate controversial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Examples include the initial dismissal of mask efficacy followed by a rapid reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **California's "Redlining"**: McKenzie refers to California's use of geofencing for medical care provision as equivalent to redlining, an "evil" act that the pro-redlining party doesn't want to admit, and the other party doesn't see as a salient issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Governor Newsom has not been publicly questioned about this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   The overriding issue of getting vaccines into arms efficiently was overshadowed by political considerations, yet this hasn't become a central point of controversy like mask mandates or vaccine side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

## Why Not a Bigger News Item?

The question of why these failures weren't a larger news story or subject to congressional inquiries remains perplexing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The host notes that if a war was lost, generals would typically face congressional scrutiny, though McKenzie questions how often true reckonings occur even in military defeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The idea that "everybody has blood on their hands" might contribute to a collective reluctance to deeply examine the failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

# Potential Solutions and Lessons (Hardly) Learned

The discussion explored alternative approaches that could have been taken and the broader lessons for future crises.

## Proposed Alternative Approaches

*   **Leveraging Private Sector Expertise**: A historical American approach when the federal government lacked capacity was to identify private sector experts and effectively deputize them (e.g., "congratulations, you're now a colonel") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. This could have involved:
    *   Tasking a company like Google with solving the data problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.
    *   Engaging Amazon for logistics, including cold chain management (which McKenzie notes is not as unprecedented as portrayed, comparing it to milk transportation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.
*   **"First Doses First" Strategy**: Prioritizing getting a first dose to as many people as possible before focusing on second doses was an "objectively correct policy" advocated by experts like Alex Tabarrok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>. This eventually gained traction after considerable delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.

## International Comparisons

The failures were not unique to the U.S. Many countries, despite different political systems, were dissatisfied with their vaccine rollout outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. The Tony Blair Institute made obvious recommendations to the British government (like "First Doses First") that were not heeded effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. Israel was cited as an example of a country with a "broadly functional response," particularly regarding the sensible handling of end-of-day shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. The question remains why no country seemed to "get it right" comprehensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>.

## Need for Accountability and Improved Systems

*   **Blameless Postmortems**: Adopting the tech industry practice of "blameless postmortems" could help society learn from failures. This involves a dispassionate record of actions and outcomes to identify areas for improvement, rather than solely focusing on assigning blame, which can distort the truth-finding process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:25">[01:58:25]</a>. A first step would be a comprehensive, truthful written history from all involved parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:16">[02:00:16]</a>. Similar practices are discussed in the context of the [[open_source_ai_models_and_their_implications]] and their role in transparent software development.
*   **Tech Industry Engagement**: The tech industry needs to become more skilled at interfacing with government and actively participate in solutions, rather than just "griping on podcasts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:58">[00:51:58]</a>. This includes strategic criticism and being prepared to "fight" for important values when necessary, exercising "intestinal fortitude" against government overreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:13">[01:20:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:23">[01:21:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:15">[01:24:15]</a>. The [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society]] illustrates the critical intersection of private and public collaboration.
*   **Government Improvement**: The government must overcome its aversion to software ("ugh field") and develop competence in this critical area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. It should also treat the tech industry as a potential partner rather than an enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>. Current after-action reports are often insufficient, praising politically expedient actions and failing to identify true issues or actionable recommendations beyond hoping "someone fixes this next time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. This echoes discussions in [[llama_3_and_ai_advancements_at_meta]] regarding the necessary evolution of government and industry partnerships.

McKenzie notes that while the U.S. accomplished an impressive feat in developing and distributing vaccines, it "vastly underperformed the true thing that we were capable of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>. The VaccinateCA team dreads a future "Bat-Signal" for another crisis, emphasizing that society should not rely on such ad-hoc volunteer efforts as Plan A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. Furthermore, the [[impact_of_ai_on_software_development_and_productivity]] explores how technological advancements could support more efficient future responses.

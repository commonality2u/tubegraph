Zark is a [[building_a_fintech_company_and_understanding_the_future_of_payments | fintech company]] based in Uganda, which gained initial investment from Sachin and Adam, marking their first angel investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03"></a>. Zark operates a digital platform for lead lending, providing funds for purchases such as motorbikes, fuel, and smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18"></a>. The company's long-term vision is to establish itself as a full-stack digital bank across Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29"></a>.

## Founder's Motivation and Early Insights

Kevin, the founder of Zark, was born in the U.S. to parents who immigrated from Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02"></a>. He felt exceptionally fortunate for the opportunities he received, which many in his ancestral homeland did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08"></a>. This background sparked his interest in development economics, seeking to understand and bridge the gap between wealthy and impoverished nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34"></a>.

During university, Kevin became deeply interested in [[microfinance_and_its_impact | microfinance]], particularly its large-scale pioneering in Bangladesh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49"></a>. He interned with prominent [[microfinance_and_its_impact | microfinance]] institutions like BRAC and Grameen Bank, engaging directly with women borrowers in villages to understand the impact of loans on their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55"></a>. Simultaneously, he observed the rise of mobile money, such as M-Pesa in East Africa, sensing an opportunity to leverage mobile technology to reinvent [[microfinance_and_its_impact | microfinance]] with greater efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35"></a>.

His personal drive to establish Zark stemmed from a desire to both generate profit and contribute positively to societal development, aiming to develop a country rather than just an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08"></a>.

### Advantages and Shortcomings of Traditional [[microfinance_and_its_impact | Microfinance]]

Traditional [[microfinance_and_its_impact | microfinance]] institutions have played a crucial role in bringing basic financial infrastructure to remote areas often overlooked by commercial banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47"></a>. They successfully underwrite individuals without formal titled assets, instead relying on group guarantees and community trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10"></a>.

However, Kevin identified inefficiencies in the traditional model. For instance, farmers had to travel to town, complete paper applications, wait extended periods for responses, and make cash payments in person, despite being comfortable with digital payments for their personal business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16"></a>.

> Kevin recounts a story from his first trip to Uganda where he offered to match savings for farmers if they opened a bank account. The farmers declined, explaining that banks were inconvenient, required travel and fees, and could be unreliable (e.g., closed hours, requiring bribes). They preferred "saving" by buying pigs, which are always accessible, appreciate in value (eating grass and growing fatter), and can be easily liquidated within the village without transport costs, making them "more liquid than cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09"></a>.

## The Role of Credit in Poverty Alleviation

Globally, 2.5 billion people lack access to banking services and credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23"></a>. Kevin highlights that in many developing countries, saving money is difficult due to cultural and structural reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37"></a>. Culturally, communal societies often expect individuals to support family and community members financially, acting as a social safety net that disperses savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45"></a>. Structurally, traditional banks are inconvenient, often requiring travel and incurring costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47"></a>.

Access to credit is crucial for economic advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00"></a>. It enables individuals to acquire productive assets, thereby increasing income and breaking the cycle of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35"></a>. For example, motorcycle taxi drivers in Uganda often spend 50% of their income on rent for a motorcycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48"></a>. Owning the asset eliminates this recurring cost, allowing them to accumulate wealth and significantly improve their livelihoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12"></a>. Zark's high repayment rates (96%) demonstrate that people are willing and able to repay loans when provided with effective capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32"></a>.

## Zark's Business Model and Evolution

Founded in June 2016, Zark initially focused on providing cash loans for various business purposes, such as agriculture or working capital for retailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52"></a>. However, a key learning was the "fungibility" of cash in lower-middle-income households, where loans intended for business often diverted to urgent personal needs like school fees or medical treatments, hindering repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10"></a>.

### The Pivot to Asset-Based Lending

Zark pivoted to lending "in kind," specifically focusing on productive assets like motorcycles for taxi drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41"></a>. This approach ensures the asset is used for income generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50"></a>. This model ensures the borrower has "skin in the game" through a down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06"></a> and guarantees the asset's productive use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18"></a>. By focusing on asset financing, Zark creates collateral through the loan itself (e.g., GPS trackers and insurance on motorcycles), eliminating the need for borrowers to possess pre-existing assets or land titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33"></a>.

This specialization in motorcycle loans allowed Zark to streamline its underwriting process, becoming experts in one industry rather than many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22"></a>. This shift significantly improved loan performance and impact, aligning with the goal of raising family incomes to solve other problems like education and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33"></a>.

### Scalability and Growth Strategy

Zark's ambition is to become the largest digital bank in Africa, facilitating trillions of dollars in investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08"></a>. Their strategy for achieving this includes:

*   **Commercial Model:** Operating as a for-profit entity ensures sustainability and scalability, attracting investment based on returns rather than relying on philanthropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31"></a>. This model can create jobs and double the income of impoverished workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47"></a>.
*   **Alternative Data for Underwriting:** Zark leverages partnerships with ride-hailing apps like SafeBoda, the largest in Uganda, to access financial and behavioral data (e.g., number of trips, customer ratings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52"></a>. This allows them to quickly assess credit risk in the absence of traditional bank statements or titled assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25"></a>.
*   **Technological [[challenges_and_innovations_in_the_fintech_industry | innovations]]**: Zark boasts a three-day loan turnaround time, the fastest in its industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56"></a>. Automation of lending processes enables efficient provision of secondary loan products like personal, fuel, and smartphone loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04"></a>. This speed and efficiency set them apart from traditional brick-and-mortar lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11"></a>.

## Mitigating Risks in Africa

While skepticism exists about investing in Africa due to perceived risks like weaker rule of law and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50"></a>, Zark demonstrates how these can be managed:

*   **Legal System Challenges:** The Ugandan court system can be slow, with lawsuits taking years to resolve, and credit bureaus lack the strength seen in Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00"></a>.
*   **Technological Mitigation:** Zark uses GPS trackers in motorcycles that can remotely cut off fuel to the engine if payments cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28"></a>. This mechanism is highly effective because the motorcycle is essential for the borrower's daily income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42"></a>. While such methods might be restricted by privacy laws in the U.S., they are accepted in Uganda as a means for individuals to access credit without traditional collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05"></a>.
*   **Lower Default Rates:** Despite weaker legal infrastructure, Zark's motorcycle loan default rate is 3%, lower than the 5.8% default rate for auto loans in the U.S., which has a stronger credit infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38"></a>. This is attributed to their tech-driven asset security and focus on productive loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00"></a>.

### Local Integration and "Business for Impact"

Kevin emphasizes the necessity of living in Africa to understand and solve African problems, criticizing competitors whose leadership teams do not reside on the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45"></a>. He is learning three local Ugandan languages to integrate with local society and gain buy-in from the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17"></a>.

The "business for impact" model, where financial success is intertwined with social good, is central to Zark's philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42"></a>. By targeting "bottom of the pyramid" customers in Africa, Zark taps into a market of billions coming online and the continent's growing working-class population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14"></a>. This approach makes Zark both commercially viable and inherently socially impactful, as it provides basic and essential services to a market that desperately needs them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47"></a>. Kevin believes that making money while doing good is possible, and Africa offers higher returns than Western markets while simultaneously creating jobs and doubling incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40"></a>. This vision positions Zark as a compelling example of [[the_future_impact_of_blockchain_and_fintech_in_emerging_markets | fintech in emerging markets]].

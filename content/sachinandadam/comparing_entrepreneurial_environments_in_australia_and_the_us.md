Jack Zhang, founder and CEO of Airwallex, offers insights into the entrepreneurial environments of Australia and the United States, particularly concerning risk-taking, work culture, and regulatory landscapes.

## Attitude Towards Risk and Mistakes
A core aspect of Airwallex's culture is being comfortable with making mistakes, learning from them, and improving, which inherently means being okay with taking risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>. Zhang distinguishes between mistakes made due to effort and care versus carelessness or lack of effort. He believes those who are intelligent, smart, and genuinely care about solving problems should be encouraged to try again after mistakes, while those who are careless should be dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>.

The discussion highlights a perception that Australia may not be a particularly risk-taking culture, and there's a tendency to criticize mistakes rather than fostering a learning attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. This contrasts with the inherent acceptance of risk in the entrepreneurial journey in regions like the US.

## Work Culture and Intensity
Jack Zhang himself is described as a "maniacally obsessed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> individual with "intensity and insatiable ambition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. He attributes his intensity, in part, to the complex and difficult nature of building a large-scale fintech business, which requires solving problems in complicated regulatory environments with technological challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Zhang's personal history, including financial struggles and working 16-hour days during university, contributed to his resilience and desire for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. He doesn't view his work as "work" because he is passionate and interested in what he does, often finding it more engaging than leisure activities like watching Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.

Regarding Australia's work culture and attitude to risk, Zhang is unsure if being "tech-forward innovative" is the most important thing for Australian society. He notes that Australia offers great social welfare, beautiful nature, and a good environment for raising children, which are reasons many people choose to live there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. He suggests that the presence of robust social safety nets in Australia might make it "harder to build grit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>, compared to the US where the high cost of living and lack of medical insurance necessitate working harder to maintain a desired lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.

## Regulatory Environment in Fintech
Building a large fintech company like Airwallex involves navigating significant regulatory pressures and dealing with large banks globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Zhang highlights that some regulators are resistant to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

Specific challenges in Australia include:
*   **Difficulty obtaining payment facility licenses:** The current regulation (Payment Purchase Facility) makes it very difficult to become a wallet, with only a few companies holding the license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.
*   **Custodian capital requirements:** A 4% custodian capital requirement on customer funds is mandated, which Zhang finds illogical since Airwallex does not lend customer deposits, and every dollar is safeguarded with a bank guarantee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. He believes this regulation unfairly favors banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.
*   **Lack of FX spread disclosure:** Unlike other financial service aspects, Australian banks are not mandated to disclose their foreign exchange (FX) spreads, which can be as high as 4-5% and are not transparent to consumers and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. Airwallex advocates for mandatory disclosure to benefit society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.

Regulatory shifts are slow, often taking years, requiring companies to wait for the right moment for changes to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.

## [[the_evolution_and_imact_of_the_australian_tech_ecosystem | Australian Tech Ecosystem]] Compared to the US
Jack Zhang noted that he built Airwallex from Melbourne, where the tech ecosystem was "quite weak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a> compared to Sydney, which has more successful tech companies like Canva and Culture Amp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. He observed that at an entrepreneur conference, only 5 out of 100 attendees were from Melbourne, while 90 were from Sydney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. This highlights a disproportionately smaller tech presence in Melbourne relative to its population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.

He attributes many early mistakes in Airwallex's journey to the less mature ecosystem in Melbourne, but also acknowledges that this experience built resilience within the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>. The ability to fail, learn, adjust, and try again was crucial for expanding into new markets like Hong Kong, the UK, Europe, and North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

In contrast, Zhang feels more at home in New York and the US culture, where entrepreneurs are more influential and accepted by society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. He believes people in the US care more about what is being built rather than just the success it represents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

## Government's Role and Investment Landscape
Zhang suggests that governments play a crucial role in fostering innovation, citing incentives provided by countries like Singapore and China decades ago, and Saudi Arabia and the US today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. He believes governments should have a "much more important role" in the long-term vision of a country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>.

He also notes that a "liquid Angel Investing market is important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>. Founders in Australia often struggle to secure early-stage capital, unlike in the US where there are more "outlier successes" and wealthy individuals willing to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>. This creates a "flywheel" effect in ecosystems like the Bay Area, where successful entrepreneurs exit, become angel investors, and start funds, further nurturing the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. The probability of founders succeeding in Australia is seen as disproportionately lower than in Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.

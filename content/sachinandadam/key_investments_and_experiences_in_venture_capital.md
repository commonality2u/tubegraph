Sir Ronald Cohen is recognized as a pivotal figure in the world of finance, particularly for his role in introducing [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | venture capital]] to the UK and later pioneering impact investing. His career highlights several key investments and foundational experiences that shaped the industry and his philosophy.

## Pioneering Venture Capital in the UK

Sir Ronald Cohen effectively brought [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | venture capital]] to the UK by founding Apax Partners at the age of 26 in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This firm grew into an industry "goliath," eventually managing over $50 billion of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. His decision to start the firm at such a young age was driven by a philosophy that "you can't learn to swim by exercising on the beach," advocating for diving in, learning fast, and gaining experience ahead of others in the new field of [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | venture capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

### Catalysts for Early Venture Capital Involvement
Cohen's decision was influenced by several factors:
*   **Personal Philosophy** His upbringing instilled the idea of doing something for oneself rather than being an employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.
*   **Technological Revolution** While at Harvard Business School in the late 1960s, he observed the emergence of the microchip, which appeared set to revolutionize the computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.
*   **Entrepreneurial Spirit** This technological shift coincided with a new entrepreneurial spirit and the establishment of the first [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | venture capital]] funds in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.
*   **Inspirational Examples** A lecture at Harvard Business School by French general Doria, one of the first [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | venture capitalists]], detailed an investment of $70,000 in Digital Equipment that was projected to be worth $100 million upon its IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. This captured his attention and highlighted the potential of [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | venture capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
*   **Conviction in Entrepreneurs** Cohen believed that entrepreneurs, unlike large companies, could overcome significant challenges and leverage new technologies effectively due to fewer constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.
*   **Obligation to Innovate** His studies at Harvard were funded by the Henry Fellowship, which required him to return to the UK and bring something of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. He chose to introduce [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | venture capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:20]</a>.

### The "Second Bounce of the Ball" Philosophy
Sir Ronald Cohen's approach to investing and life is encapsulated by his "second bounce of the ball" motto, which refers to anticipating the future rather than just reacting to the immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. His first book, *The Second Bounce of the Ball*, advocates for the principles: "start young, think big, and stick with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. He endured nine difficult years before raising his first [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | venture fund]], demonstrating the importance of perseverance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.

## Notable Investments

### Apple
Apax Partners, through Cohen's American partner Alan Patricof, was one of the first investors in Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>. The investment originated from Patricof's friend who couldn't invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>. The simple concept that drove the investment was the idea of creating a very small computer for a desk, moving beyond mainframes and mini-computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>. Alan Patricof later also invested in AOL, driven by the foresight that computers would eventually communicate with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. Patricof sold his stake in Apple after making ten times his money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>. An anecdote highlights the long-term potential: Patricof's niece, who received $1,000 in Apple stock for her Bat Mitzvah, saw it grow to $130,000 many years later, representing 130 times the initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>.

## Transition to Impact Investing

While the core of this topic is on [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | venture capital]] and key investments, it's notable that Sir Ronald Cohen's career evolved towards impact investing. This shift was motivated by a desire for a "bigger meaning" beyond just delivering high rates of return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>. He sought to apply the same systemic approach that powered business development to social issues, aiming to improve lives at scale by bringing investment to social entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a>. This led to the coining of the term "impact investing" and the development of instruments like the social impact bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[24:58:00]</a>.

## Advice for Future Leaders

Sir Ronald Cohen emphasizes several key lessons for young people and future leaders:
*   **Believe in Yourself**: "You are ready much sooner than you think to go out and build the business and do something really exciting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:21:00">[41:21:00]</a>.
*   **Combine Good with Well**: He advises integrating positive societal impact with financial success: "do good and do well at the same time. That's the future and from that springs real fulfillment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:42:00">[41:42:00]</a>.
*   **Work Hard**: He notes that while many are bright, combining unique qualities with hard work and sustained effort leads to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:10:00">[47:10:00]</a>.

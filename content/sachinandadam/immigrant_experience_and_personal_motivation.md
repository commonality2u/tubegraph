Emil Michael, an Egyptian-born American businessman and former Chief Business Officer at Uber, attributes much of his drive and success to his [[impact_of_personal_experiences_on_entrepreneurship | immigrant experience]] and the unique motivations it fostered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Roots of Empathy and Drive

Emil Michael's family, who are Christian, immigrated from Egypt to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Michael often reflects on how critical it was to have individuals who "looked out for" him during different periods of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Receiving such empathy as a young person was a "beautiful gift," which instilled in him a desire to have a similar positive [[influence_of_immigrant_mentality_on_entrepreneurship | impact on others]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This compassionate perspective may not always be immediately apparent given his intense professional demeanor, but it stems from his [[cultural_assimilation_and_its_impact_on_personal_identity | personal experiences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## The Two Gifts of Immigration

Michael identifies two significant "gifts" that contributed to his intense drive and [[motivation_and_background_of_successful_entrepreneurs | entrepreneurial journey and mindset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>:

1.  **Limitless Opportunity:** Immigrating to America from a country where his family was a religious minority instilled a profound sense of gratitude and the belief that opportunity in the U.S. is "limitless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This led to a feeling of obligation to fully leverage every opportunity, recognizing the sacrifices his parents made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
2.  **Value of Education:** His parents, being educated immigrants, had a "predisposition that education was the way to make it in the world as a starting point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This strong emphasis on education, coupled with his own limitations in sports and music, pushed him to excel in math and computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Motivation and Overcoming Bias

Michael's [[founders_motivations_and_personal_histories | motivation]] was further fueled by an "extrinsic" desire to prove others wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. A high school or college counselor once told him he would "never ever get into an Ivy League" because he wasn't good at sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Despite being class president and excelling academically, this negative bias instilled a "chip on his shoulder" that drove him to work harder and never accept being told he couldn't achieve something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

This combination of [[intrinsic_versus_extrinsic_motivation_in_life_goals | intrinsic and extrinsic motivation]] is common among successful founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Michael notes a perceived decline in this "immense sense of gratitude" towards opportunities among younger generations in wealthy countries, attributing it to a "decadent era" where hardships are minimal and people take privileges for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, partly due to a public education system that doesn't adequately teach history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

## Balancing [[ambition_and_personal_life_balance | Ambition]] and Personal Life

After his intense career at Uber, Michael experienced "post-deal depression," a common feeling when the adrenaline of a major professional undertaking subsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. He consciously shifted his focus to [[personal_experiences_and_goals_in_entrepreneurship | personal ambitions]] that had been postponed, such as moving his parents to Miami, getting married, and having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. He advises young men to integrate personal life rather than postpone it, although he acknowledges his own path was unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

Michael believes that men often desire to make career strides to confidently provide for their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. For him, the intense focus on his career meant there was "no room for anyone else" in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. While he channeled his professional [[motivation_and_background_of_successful_entrepreneurs | ambition]] into advising and investing post-Uber, he acknowledges that the "biological programming" to have a family offers a profound, extraordinary gratification that a career alone cannot provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. He also cherishes the "village" aspect of family, with parents and grandparents, which provides a deep sense of humanity and shared joy in raising children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>.

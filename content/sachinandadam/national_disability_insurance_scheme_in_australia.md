The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is Australia's national disability insurance scheme, designed to support over 500,000 people living with disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Despite its crucial role, the NDIS faces significant challenges, including [[fraud_and_inefficiencies_in_the_ndis | fraud]], low patient satisfaction, and rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It is estimated that around $4 billion is "rooted" from the scheme every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These issues impact the quality of life for many Australians, making the NDIS a critical issue facing the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Personal Impact of the NDIS

The challenges within the NDIS are deeply personal for many, including the creators of this content. Their brother, Aran, was born with cerebral palsy 22 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Growing up around disability has highlighted the importance of disability services for people's quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Aran's family made significant life changes to provide him with the best possible life, including quitting a high-powered finance job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. They fought for his needs at school, took him on international trips, ensured he received necessary equipment, and supported his socialisation, leading to him completing two university degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Challenges Faced by Individuals with Disabilities

Aran describes two main challenges for people growing up with a disability in Australia:
*   **Stigmatization** from the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure challenges**, such as inaccessible houses, buildings, and areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

When the NDIS first launched, it brought hope for a centralized system with government funding to provide essential equipment, making life easier and promoting mobility and independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. For example, a standing wheelchair greatly improved Aran's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Despite its benefits, the NDIS is often perceived as a very bureaucratic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Many clients struggle with insufficient funding, requiring constant advocacy to secure necessities for daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Improved communication and understanding within the NDIS are needed to better support people with disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Kismet's Approach to Improving the NDIS

[[kismets_approach_to_improving_ndis | Kismet]] is one of the fastest-growing technology companies in Australia, aiming to make the NDIS more efficient through software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Kismet's overarching goal is to improve accessibility to healthcare by reducing administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Mark Woodland, Founder of Kismet

Mark Woodland, the founder of Kismet, served in the Army for 10 years and previously led a childcare software company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. His decision to start Kismet stemmed from a personal desire to address aging care population problems, particularly how people survive without families and the burden on the "sandwich generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

After selling his previous company, Xplor, for nearly $100 million, Mark initially attempted to retire as a farmer in the Melbourne countryside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. However, a call from his mother-in-law regarding her aging mother's budget needs made him realize the similar administrative challenges in healthcare and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This inspired him to abandon farming and create Kismet, focusing on connecting people with care while reducing administrative burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### How Kismet Works

Within the NDIS ecosystem, Kismet targets the administrative burden faced by support coordinators, who are responsible for organizing care for participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Kismet's platform automates much of the process of finding suitable and available service providers (e.g., physiotherapists, speech therapists) for participants' specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Users submit an inquiry and receive a shortlist of providers within 24 to 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

This significantly reduces the time support coordinators spend on finding providers, making the process more time-effective for both coordinators and participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

> "Kismet our overarching goal is basically to help improve accessibility to healthcare and the way we do that is by reducing Administration." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>

### The Role of Technology in the NDIS

While technology like Kismet can solve the major problems of administration and lack of connection within the NDIS, it cannot solve *all* its problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Technology can free up people to focus on issues that technology cannot address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

Mark Woodland believes more technology companies should be established in all areas of healthcare, not just the NDIS, due to the significant challenges present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Kismet's success highlights the advantages of being a first mover in a new, regulated market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

## Government's Crucial Role

Despite technological advancements and [[impact_of_the_startup_ecosystem_in_australia | the impact of the startup ecosystem in Australia]], the government plays a vital role in ensuring the NDIS functions effectively. It must:
*   Allocate funding in a better way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
*   Fix [[fraud_and_inefficiencies_in_the_ndis | fraud]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
*   Ensure the quality of service providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   Guarantee that taxpayer money directly translates to improved patient outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## The Future of the NDIS

Optimism remains for the NDIS, as it is seen as a great system that benefits many people and must be maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. To achieve its full potential and become a "utopic idea," the NDIS requires a combination of private technology companies like Kismet and strong government intervention to keep the scheme on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

Mark Woodland has larger aspirations, including solving housing affordability and potentially entering politics to address societal issues that technology alone cannot fix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. This highlights a broader vision for [[the_future_of_technology_and_innovation_in_australia | the future of technology and innovation in Australia]] that extends beyond specific platforms to systemic change.

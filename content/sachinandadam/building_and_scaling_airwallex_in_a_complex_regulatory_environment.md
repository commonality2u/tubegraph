[[Building and scaling Airwallex | Airwallex]], led by founder and CEO Jack Zhang, is a technology company revolutionizing how businesses operate globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Last valued at $8 billion, [[Building a billion dollar company | it stands]] as one of Australia's significant tech startup stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Navigating a Complicated Industry
The financial industry is inherently complex, characterized by formidable large banks, intense regulatory pressures, and intricate technological challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Operating in fintech means not only focusing on customer experience but also meticulously managing risk, ensuring compliance, adhering to regulatory issues, handling accounting, and maintaining robust real-time technology systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Airwallex sees itself as [[building a fintech company and understanding the future of payments | building critical infrastructure]] for global entrepreneurs, recognizing the significant responsibility that comes with this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

### The Mission: Empowering Global Entrepreneurs
The core mission of Airwallex is to empower entrepreneurs worldwide to operate anywhere, at any time, by becoming the economic infrastructure that enables them to grow beyond borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Zhang's motivation stems from not wanting other entrepreneurs to face the same difficulties he experienced when dealing with large institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. A key aim is to simplify global operations for businesses, making life as easy as possible so they don't have to endure similar struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

The company envisions a future where it is a single, vertically integrated payment and financial platform for modern businesses operating globally, covering everything needed for finance, revenue, and payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

## Challenges in Global Expansion
[[Expanding a business internationally and managing a global workforce | Expanding globally]] presents significant hurdles, as financial systems and governance structures vary wildly across countries. Specific challenges include:
*   **Regulatory Resistance**: Some regulators are resistant to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.
*   **Lack of Real-time Payment Networks**: Countries may lack real-time payment networks like Australia's NPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   **Inflexible Local Networks**: Some local payment networks don't accept fixed remitter names, complicating fraud detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
*   **Legacy Systems**: Many legacy systems globally are difficult to access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
*   **Bank Resistance**: Some banks refuse to partner, viewing fintech companies as threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
*   **Cultural Challenges**: Significant education and persuasion are often required to convince stakeholders of the benefits of an open economy and network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

Airwallex has a long way to go, with ambitions to expand into South America, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and South Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. Entering markets like Japan, Indonesia, UAE, and Saudi Arabia is particularly challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

### Stance on Web3 and the Future of Payments
Jack Zhang believes that Web3, despite its promises of frictionless currency transactions, doesn't solve real-world global payment problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. Airwallex already processes nearly $200 billion annually, with over 90% via local payment networks and 75% being real-time and free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. He argues that you "cannot be cheaper than free" or "faster than instant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.

While acknowledging potential use cases for cryptocurrency in countries with volatile currencies (e.g., Kenya, Turkey, Argentina) for payroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>, he points out that its philosophy of an open network conflicts with central banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. Zhang has not seen the significant social value or benefits from blockchain technology in the last 15 years, unlike AI, which brings weekly and monthly life-changing events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

### Navigating Regulatory Frameworks
Zhang doesn't believe in a payment "utopia" but rather in continually improving real-world experiences within existing regulatory frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. Airwallex communicates infrastructure issues and customer feedback to regulators, though he notes that regulatory shifts are slow and can take years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

In Australia, for example, obtaining a "payment purchase facility" license is very difficult, with only a few companies holding one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. A requirement to hold 4% of customer funds in capital makes little sense for a non-lending institution like Airwallex, which fully safeguards customer deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. This regulation favors traditional banks, which have significant lobbying power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.

Airwallex also advocates for FX transparency, working with organizations like Wise to make FX spread disclosure mandatory for big banks, which currently charge 4-5% spread without disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.

## Building a Resilient, High-Performance Culture
[[Building a company in public | A key aspect of Airwallex's culture]] is accepting mistakes, learning from them, and continuously improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This requires being comfortable with taking risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Zhang differentiates between mistakes made due to care and effort versus those made due to carelessness or lack of curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>. People who are intelligent, smart, and genuinely care about solving problems should be encouraged to try again after mistakes, as they will learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>.

[[Building and scaling Airwallex | Airwallex]] fosters a high-performance culture by attracting people who share the company's mission and vision, iterating on improvements over time, and consistently raising the bar for recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. Those who don't align with these operating principles naturally leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. Zhang believes there are enough ambitious people globally who want to work hard for a meaningful mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

The company learned to recruit effectively relatively late, from 2020 onwards, due to the weaker tech ecosystem in Melbourne compared to Sydney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. Despite making many mistakes, this experience built resilience in the business, making them unafraid to fail and try again when entering new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.

## Leadership and Motivation
Jack Zhang's intensity and ambition are evident, though he describes himself as serious rather than scary, valuing enduring relationships built on trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. His personal intensity was shaped by financial struggles and social challenges after moving to Australia at 15 with poor English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Working 16-hour days during university, often at the sacrifice of social life, instilled a strong desire to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

His motivation has shifted from personal financial goals to a mission-driven desire to empower entrepreneurs globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. He no longer focuses on Airwallex becoming a "trillion dollar company" but on [[building a fintech company and understanding the future of payments | building a global infrastructure]] and providing the right products to make customers succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. This shift is partly why he rejected an acquisition offer from Stripe, as he feared losing control of Airwallex's mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

Zhang identifies his "superpowers" as:
*   **Technical Depth**: A deep understanding of product and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
*   **Vision Communication**: The ability to articulate a vision and tell a compelling story to regulators and banks, influencing their decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

### Australia's Startup Culture and Risk-Taking
Zhang notes that Australia's strong social welfare system might inadvertently reduce the incentive for individuals to take extreme risks and build "grit," unlike countries with fewer safety nets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. He believes governments, like those in Singapore or China, play a crucial role in fostering innovation through incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. However, he doesn't dictate what Australia "should" do, acknowledging its benefits as a place to live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

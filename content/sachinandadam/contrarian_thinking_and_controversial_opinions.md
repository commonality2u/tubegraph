Tim Doyle, former Chief Marketing Officer at Koala and founder of Eucalyptus, is known in the Australian startup scene for his [[the_significance_of_ignoring_conventional_advice | independent thinking]] and often controversial opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. His approach is driven by a competitive nature and a deep conviction in his beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## The Core of Conviction

Doyle emphasizes that if one cannot have conviction in their beliefs, there's little point in pursuing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. He aligns with the concept of "strong beliefs, weakly held," indicating a willingness to put his ideas forward, be challenged, and even be proven wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. His learning primarily stems from instances where he has asserted a belief about how the world should operate, only for someone to present a compelling counter-argument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

He cares deeply about what people think, but simultaneously believes "most people are wrong about quite a lot of things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. When confronted with valid reasons to disagree, he is quick to change his opinion, viewing challenge as the best way to learn and avoid a "swamp of mass agreement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

## Testing Beliefs and Embracing Failure

Doyle's career is marked by his readiness to test his strong beliefs, often by allocating capital to them. He acknowledges that many of his assumptions about marketing have been proven incorrect when tested with money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

One notable example from his time at Koala involved investing A$50,000 with BuzzFeed to produce content, believing that a well-known brand logo would provide "extra validity" on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This experiment resulted in a mere 60 clicks, making it their most expensive channel bet and an "incredible f**k up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Despite such failures, he views these experiences as valuable, recognizing that putting bold statements out there is essential for feedback and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. This willingness to take [[balancing_risk_and_innovation_in_business_strategy | calculated risks]] and learn from missteps is central to his [[challenges_and_reflections_in_business_decision_making | decision-making process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

He attributes his ability to craft compelling narratives and make informed bets in marketing to his background in high school debating and sports gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. These experiences taught him about structured storytelling, feedback loops, and how narratives influence real-time markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.

## Marketing, Strategy, and Standing Out

For Doyle, marketing is fundamentally about strategy â€“ winning, differentiating, and creating compelling offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. He believes content must stand out and be memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

> "If you're gonna if you're gonna like feed back your managers ideas to them in a way that seems like mildly agreeable you're gonna be pretty unremarkable and the places you're going to end up are pretty unremarkable." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>

He advocates for creating content that challenges people and grabs attention, even if it's "low brow" or controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This is exemplified by the viral success of a TikTok video of Malcolm Turnbull saying "don't do law," which resonated with a specific "interest-based graph" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

## Controversial Opinions and Industry Takes

Doyle is open about his strong opinions on various topics within the Australian startup ecosystem:

*   **Hating "Strategic" and "Innovative":** He dislikes these words, as highlighted by the hosts who jokingly introduce him as the "Strategic and Innovative founder of Eucalyptus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Junior VCs:** He controversially states that "99% of Australia Junior VCs add no value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. He argues that the model for junior VCs to become valuable is broken, citing issues such as inexperienced individuals interacting with early-stage founders, giving poor advice, asking "dumb questions" as portfolio analysts, and lacking real operational experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>. He believes young, smart people should be building something or working for someone who is building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.
*   **Ideas vs. Execution:** He challenges the notion that "ideas are cheap," asserting that while "bad ideas are cheap," "good ideas are rare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>. He contends that designing teams, forums, and cultures capable of producing good ideas is "extremely difficult, much more difficult than execution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>. This highlights his appreciation for [[importance_of_creativity_and_risktaking | creative brilliance]] over mere incremental improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>.
*   **Life Coach Sales Chad vs. Miami VC:** When asked to choose between a "core a life course peddling life coach sales Chad" and a "Miami VC with no exits," he unequivocally picks the "sales Chad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. His reasoning is that the sales Chad is actively "hustling to get things done to sell things to like build something," whereas the Miami VC is a "trend follower in a field that rewards people who don't follow trends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>. This preference underscores his value for tangible action over signaling or passive investment.
*   **Australian VC Ecosystem:** Despite his critiques, he generally sees the Australian VC ecosystem positively, noting that larger VCs have been ambitious and supportive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. He contrasts this with the US, finding Australian VCs "largely good and have had good impact on the ecosystem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.

## Self-Reflection and Continuous Learning

Doyle is remarkably self-aware of his own weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>. He admits to being a "bad first principles product thinker" with a short timeline for seeing things work, which can lead to frequent changes in direction and confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>. He also describes himself as "surprisingly low ambition" from a technology perspective, often prioritizing immediate revenue over long-term platform building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>.

He reflects on a painful learning experience in late 2021/early 2022 when he "blew out" Eucalyptus's metrics by "chasing growth" against his own disciplined marketing principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>. This led to redundancies and reinforced the importance of discipline, even when external advice pushed for aggressive growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. This period of reflection taught him to take ownership of mistakes and understand their root causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>.

His [[reflections_on_intuition_and_decisionmaking | thinking style]] is characterized by a "shortness of attention span and the speed that I like think at," creating a "constant need for new challenges and new things and new problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. This drive pushes him to explore new things but also results in unfinished projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

Overall, Tim Doyle's contrarian and opinionated nature is not about being disruptive for its own sake, but rather a deliberate strategy for learning, differentiating, and driving meaningful impact by challenging conventional wisdom and openly testing his convictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

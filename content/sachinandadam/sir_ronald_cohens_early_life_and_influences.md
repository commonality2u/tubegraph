Sir Ronald Cohen, a prominent figure in impact investing and a significant role model for many, shares insights into his early life, including his experiences as a refugee and the values that shaped his career and personal mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Childhood as a Refugee and Family Values

At his core, Ronald Cohen describes himself as a person who has always strived to do big things that improve the world, while also ensuring he could look after his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. His family were refugees from Egypt, having lost everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

When he was 11 years old, his family fled Egypt during the Suez Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This event had a profound impact on his worldview, particularly shaping his beliefs about equality and social justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. His father, who cried on the plane out of Egypt having lost his business and nationality, portrayed their arrival in Britain as a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Education and Early Success

Upon arriving in Britain, Ronald did not speak English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. He learned some English during the summer holiday before an interview at a grammar school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Despite the interview not going "brilliantly," his father boldly told the headmaster that if he took Ronald into the school, he would be "top of the class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This statement from his father placed a significant expectation on the 11-year-old Ronald, who was already aware of his parents' difficult situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

He credits a brilliant history professor at the grammar school for coaching him and helping him get into Oxford University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Ronald found learning easy and had consistently been "top of the class" at his previous, strict Catholic school in Egypt, which incidentally included Jewish, Christian, and Muslim students who coexisted very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. His academic track record gave his father a basis for his assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Oxford and Idealism

His time at Oxford in the 1960s further reinforced his values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. He describes the 60s as an "idealistic time" where the younger generation rejected the ideas of the older generation, particularly the fear of nuclear destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Instead, concepts like "flower power" and peace prevailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

These experiences certainly shaped his worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. While he believes the core family values of worrying about less fortunate people and sharing life's benefits would have been central to him anyway, arriving as a refugee undeniably shaped his perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

His journey demonstrates how [[founders_motivations_and_personal_histories | personal histories and motivations]], particularly challenging ones, can deeply influence an individual's drive to effect change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Furthermore, his exposure to the idealistic atmosphere at Oxford illustrates the [[Philosophical and psychological influences on successful business leaders | philosophical and psychological influences]] that can shape an individual's approach to their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

After Oxford, Ronald Cohen went on to Harvard Business School, an experience that would further catalyze his entrepreneurial ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

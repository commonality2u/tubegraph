This article explores the career path of Cat, a professional who has navigated diverse fields including law, funds management, social enterprise, and [[Venture capital and angel investing | venture capital]], ultimately aligning her commercial acumen with a desire for social impact. Her journey highlights the evolving landscape of career opportunities where financial success and social contribution can intertwine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Early Career and the Search for Purpose

Cat began her career in law, working at prestigious firms like Clayton Utz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Growing up in regional Western Australia from a poor family, her parents encouraged a financially secure career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Despite initial thoughts of pursuing human rights law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, she was funneled towards corporate and commercial paths by her law school curriculum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

During her time as a banking and finance lawyer at Clayton Utz, especially during the GFC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, she experienced a "dissonance" between her internal desire to help people and her entrepreneurial spirit, and the external expectation of a safe, traditional career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. While the training and contacts at top-tier firms were invaluable for understanding "world class" standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, she felt she was trying to fit in and made herself "wrong for not wanting what everybody else wanted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

This period led her to question whether she could combine her commercial and financial interests with her desire to help people, a combination she initially believed to be mutually exclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### The Power of Networking

Cat emphasizes that genuine connection, rather than transactional "networking," is key to career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. She suggests being genuinely interested in others and thinking about how to uniquely help them without being asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. This approach led to unexpected opportunities, such as a contact from a former colleague vouching for her, which helped her transition into a legal role at Perpetual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a> and later into her first commercial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

A notable example of this authentic networking came when a friend, Josh Ross from Humanity, connected her with Lynley Edwards, who was on the board of Grameen Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This connection, born from genuine interest, eventually led to Cat being offered the CEO position at Grameen Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

## Leading a Social Enterprise: Grameen Australia

Cat's career took a significant turn when she became the CEO of Grameen Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. Grameen Australia's origins trace back to Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, founded by Professor Muhammad Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering microfinance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.

### The Microfinance Model

The core problem Grameen Bank sought to solve was poverty rooted in a lack of access to financial services for those without asset collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. Yunus "re-engineered and reimagined" lending by introducing "social collateral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. Instead of individual loans, five borrowers would form a group, and Grameen would lend to them, holding them collectively responsible for individual loan repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. These groups met weekly to discuss problems and crowdsource solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

This model led to nearly 100% repayment rates with interest, enabling women to become more self-sustaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. This system is defined as a "social business" because it generates interest, allowing it to fund its own expansion rather than solely relying on grants like a charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. In Bangladesh, Grameen Bank has issued over $28 billion to more than 10 million women, with a 97% repayment rate, and has been replicated in over 50 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.

### Grameen Australia's Mission

In Australia, Grameen Australia aimed to replicate this microfinance model to assist low-income individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Cat's role involved opening up Grameen's constitution to operate domestically, demerging from Asian operations, and assembling resources to pilot the model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. The pilot location was chosen as Maidstone Meadows in Melbourne, Victoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.

Cat highlights that the microfinance model's success depends on careful replication, particularly the social collateral aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. She contrasts Grameen's interest-bearing, group-lending social business model with traditional not-for-profit or one-to-one microfinance approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>. While some believe Australians lack the cultural aptitude for sharing personal financial details in groups, Cat views this as a myth, believing people are willing to work together if it helps them achieve their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. Grameen's success in the US, with a 99% repayment rate from 1.3 billion dollars issued to over 130,000 women over 10 years, supports the model's adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

## Transition to [[Venture capital and angel investing | Venture Capital]] and Accelerators

After her work at Grameen, Cat moved into the [[Venture capital and angel investing | venture capital]] and accelerator space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. This move aligns with a long-held dream to "scale startups and help maybe stalled startups to fly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. She joined Catalyze, a unique firm that operates as a collective of 180 business owners and "corporations of one" with functional expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. Many members are ex-CEOs or post-exit founders and entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.

Catalyze functions as "management consulting and [[venture_capital_and_angel_investing | venture capital]] on demand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>, working with validated startups (e.g., $500,000+ revenue) to help them reach a liquidity event or exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>. Unlike traditional [[venture_capital_and_angel_investing | VCs]] who primarily inject money and sit on advisory boards, Catalyze acts as a "commercialization partner," providing a virtual C-suite (e.g., Chief Revenue Officer, Chief Marketing Officer) that integrates with the founders' management team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>. Their performance-based model means they have an equity stake in the business and advisory fees, aligning their success with that of the startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.

Cat is currently involved with Squadify, a team performance platform, where she serves as Commercial Director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. This role allows her to live out her dream of being involved in the scale-up journey of a startup whose goal is to "democratize leadership and to help teams realize their ambitions without burning out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>.

## Future Outlook: [[The origins and evolution of impact investing | Impact Investing]]

Looking ahead, Cat sees her pathway focusing on [[the_origins_and_evolution_of_impact_investing | impact investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. She is excited about working in the commercial world again, specifically for a purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>. She plans to build a "portfolio career" that offers sustainable income while allowing her to make a unique contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>. Her mindset has shifted from a linear career progression to one focused on "how can I make a living whilst making a difference at the same time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>.

## Final Advice

Cat's primary advice to those navigating their career paths is to recognize:
> "You are enough as you are. I think a lot of people make choices to prove something to parents or society that's not aligned with themselves because they want to prove they're good enough." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>

She encourages individuals to make choices that are a "true expression of who I am as a human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>, even if it means not following conventional paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>. Ultimately, knowing oneself and living authentically will lead to greater happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>.

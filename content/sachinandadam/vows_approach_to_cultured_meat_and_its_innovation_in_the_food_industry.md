From: [[sachinandadam]] <br/> 

Vow, an [[innovation_in_australian_technology | Australian startup]], is on a mission to address the global demand for meat by diversifying the human diet through [[challenges_and_advancements_in_cultured_meat_technology | cultured meat]] production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Their aim is to fulfill this demand without relying on unethical factory farming or habitat destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Unlike [[comparison_between_cultured_meat_and_plantbased_alternatives | plant-based meat brands]] that attempt to imitate existing products, Vow focuses on [[product_development_and_innovation_in_tech_startups | innovating]] by growing meat from any species throughout Earth's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## The Global Meat Crisis and Limitations of Alternatives

Global demand for meat continues to rise year over year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Traditional animal agriculture is a significant contributor to [[environmental_impact_of_traditional_meat_production | CO2 emissions]], being constantly flagged as one of the top few industries for its impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. It accounts for nearly 60% of all greenhouse gases related to food and is the primary driver of biodiversity loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Livestock production alone is responsible for about 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, surpassing all other forms of transport combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The current food system cannot meet the projected growing demands for meat over the next 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Existing [[comparison_between_cultured_meat_and_plantbased_alternatives | plant-based alternatives]] have largely failed to shift the eating habits of carnivores, primarily convincing vegetarians and vegans to try something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible have stumbled in their efforts to compete in the low-price, commoditized beef burger market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Vow's "contrarian bet" is that the key to change isn't asking people to give up meat, but rather giving them something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Vow's Cultured Meat Approach

Vow produces [[challenges_and_advancements_in_cultured_meat_technology | cultured meat]], which is animal meat grown from animal cells without needing to kill the animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This process involves taking cells that repair muscle, fat, and connective tissue, and growing them outside the animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The cells are grown in a "media," a juice-like mixture of vitamins and minerals that recreates the conditions found in an animal's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

A meat scientist noted that meat's desirability and satiating qualities are complex, requiring dozens or hundreds of different biomolecules that combine to create the sensory experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This complexity can only be replicated using animal tissue, and producing it without animals necessitates cell culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Genetically, Vow's cells are identical to those found in an animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## Technological Innovations and Efficiency

Vow has distinguished itself in the [[challenges_and_advancements_in_cultured_meat_technology | cultured meat]] industry through its cost-effectiveness and unique [[product_development_and_innovation_in_tech_startups | product development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. While other approved companies in the space (Just and Upside) have raised over $600 million each, Vow has raised $56 million, yet operates at a larger scale and has sold considerably more products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Andromeda Bioreactor

Vow's "Factory 2" is their commercial food factory where all their [[challenges_and_advancements_in_cultured_meat_technology | cultured meat]] is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. They have developed a bespoke bioreactor called Andromeda, designed to be both cost-effective and scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. This facility's cost is a fraction of other [[challenges_and_advancements_in_cultured_meat_technology | cultured meat]] facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Vow achieved a Guinness World Record by producing 20,000 liters of cell culture in a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. They eliminated unnecessary complexity and anything not dictated by physics, reducing costs by about 45% compared to similar systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Their in-house designed system is significantly more efficient than externally procured ones, allowing them to produce three times as much cell mass with their new process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This allows them to produce thousands of kilos of cell mass from Andromeda each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

## Product and Market Strategy

Vow's core innovation lies in creating products consumers have never tried, focusing on new textures, tastes, and utilizing diverse animal species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. With approximately 6,000 mammal species and 11,000 bird species, Vow sees a future of diverse choices beyond just chicken, cows, and pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

The company's [[market_strategies_and_consumer_perception_of_cultured_meat_products | market strategy]] is inspired by Tesla's approach: starting with very high-end products and gradually moving down-market to achieve widespread consumer behavior change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Their first brand, Forge, is a luxury brand launched in Singapore and soon expanding to other jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Forge products, such as a Japanese quail parfait and luxury foie gras and scallops, are sold in high-end restaurants to create a positive influence and halo effect, eventually paving the way for supermarket presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

Vow recognizes a significant [[market_strategies_and_consumer_perception_of_cultured_meat_products | consumer perception]] challenge, where people often confuse [[challenges_and_advancements_in_cultured_meat_technology | cultured meat]] with [[comparison_between_cultured_meat_and_plantbased_alternatives | plant-based alternatives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. They emphasize that their product is real meat, not a plant imitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Vow also clarifies that they do not aim to replace local farmers but to augment the food system, ensuring access to great meat for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

## The Future Vision

Since its inception in 2019, Vow has passed multi-year regulatory approvals and grown a global team of 70, becoming [[innovation_in_australian_technology | Australia's leader in cultured meat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. They aim to launch in Australia in a couple of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

Vow's ultimate vision for the [[the_future_of_food_and_ag_tech_innovations | future of food]] is to create "no compromise" meat that is tasty, nutritious, affordable, and sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. In 10 to 20 years, they foresee consumers buying cultured meat that tastes better than traditional options, potentially like Wagyu beef, with the nutritional profile of salmon (rich in omega-3s and iron), abundant protein, a long shelf life, ease of cooking, and a tiny [[environmental_impact of traditional meat production | environmental footprint]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This ambitious goal drives Vow to overcome the inherent [[challenges_and_advancements_in_cultured_meat_technology | challenges and advancements in cultured meat technology]] and potentially become the biggest food company in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

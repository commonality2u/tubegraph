The potential for [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_implications_for_society | artificial intelligence]] to pose [[challenges_faced_by_ai_developers_regarding_safety_concerns | existential risks]] to humanity is a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This perspective views the development of [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_implications_for_society | AI]] technology as a potential threat to human existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Emergence from the Blogosphere
One specific hot take regarding [[challenges_faced_by_ai_developers_regarding_safety_concerns | existential risk]] concerns related to [[artificial_intelligence_and_its_implications_for_society | artificial intelligence]] is that this entire discourse emerged from the blogosphere at a particular historical moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The unique characteristic of the blogosphere as a medium is its nested comments feature, allowing for "comments on comments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

To achieve a successful blog post, it generally needs to drive significant debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The type of content that excels at generating such debate includes super theoretical and abstract pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Given this dynamic, it is not surprising that the [[challenges_faced_by_ai_developers_regarding_safety_concerns | X-risk AI]] concerns largely originated from this medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This is attributed to the principle that "the medium is the message," where blogging incentivizes deep, thoughtful, provocative, abstract, and theoretical arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

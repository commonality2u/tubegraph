Tim Doyle, former Chief Marketing Officer at Koala and founder of [[eucalyptuss_approach_to_capital_allocation | Eucalyptus]], shares his insights on business, leadership, and personal drivers that have shaped his career in the Australian startup scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Tim Doyle's Core Philosophy and Drivers

At his core, Tim Doyle is driven by the desire to understand how to get the most out of people and organizational structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. He finds immense joy in creating environments where people can succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. His philosophy posits that one's "life's work" can be found in *how* a company is built, not solely in *what* is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Competitiveness is central to his work life, though outside of work, he operates in a more relaxed mode, finding therapeutic activities like running and golf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This competitive drive manifested early, such as in high school and in his first job at a Bavarian Beer Cafe, where he challenged the owner's business strategy at just 19 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. He distinguishes ambition from competitiveness: his ambition stems from wanting to see his vision of how businesses should operate executed at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, while competitiveness ensures his specific version of that vision comes to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

Tim is known as an independent and contrarian thinker, holding strong beliefs that are weakly held, meaning he's open to being challenged and changing his mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. He believes that putting bold ideas out there is crucial for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. A notable example is a $50,000 investment in BuzzFeed content for Koala, which yielded only 60 clicks, proving his initial assumption about brand validity wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. He emphasizes that being memorable in one's career and through content requires challenging existing norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

His underlying psychological drivers include a short attention span and fast thinking, creating a constant need for new challenges and problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

## Marketing Insights

Tim Doyle is regarded as one of Australia's best marketing professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. If designing a marketing university course, he would prioritize:

1.  **Strategy:** Marketing is fundamentally about strategy â€“ how to win, differentiate, and create compelling offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Understanding frameworks like "The Seven Powers" is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
2.  **Storytelling:** Most marketing is dressed-up storytelling, focusing on crafting narratives that resonate with an audience and are memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This includes having a "hook" and a "resolution" in content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.
3.  **Capital Allocation:** Only after mastering strategy and storytelling should marketers focus on moving money around to reach audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

He argues that the distinction between paid advertising (like Facebook ads) and organic content (like SEO) is a false dichotomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. Both involve paying for content creation and distribution, just through different routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

A significant opportunity in marketing is the return of the "interest-based graph" on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, shifting from a social-graph distribution model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. This means content that holds engagement and interest over a longer period is now more rewarded, allowing for deeper dives into niche topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

His aptitude for marketing stems from high school debating, which taught structured storytelling, and extensive sports gambling in university, where he observed the real-time impact of narrative and perception on markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.

## [[eucalyptuss_approach_to_capital_allocation | Eucalyptus's Approach to Capital Allocation]]

Tim challenges the prevailing narrative that D2C (direct-to-consumer) businesses are inherently bad, especially compared to SaaS (Software as a Service) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. While SaaS cohorts generate annuities, D2C growth often relies on product innovation that can mature and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.

Eucalyptus positions itself as a "solution generation engine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. Its capital allocation strategy involves:
*   **Sustainable Growth:** Funding individual brands (like the Udi) only as much as they can sustainably grow and deliver contribution margin back to the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.
*   **Reinvestment in Core:** Reinvesting that captured margin into the core "solution generation engine" (e.g., funding engineers, new product development) to unlock new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.
*   **Depth in Healthcare:** The deeper Eucalyptus goes into healthcare, the more legitimate and powerful its platform becomes, unlocking bigger pockets of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

Tim views Eucalyptus as an antidote to the traditional D2C model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. He admits to a "YOLO" moment in early 2022 where he over-optimized for growth, leading to redundancies and a painful learning experience about deviating from his principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>.

The "House of Brands" strategy is a long-term design choice for Eucalyptus to mitigate risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. It's dangerous to triple down on one thing because growth curves can change, and competitors can emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.

### GLP-1 Medications and Future Strategy

In the context of GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) medications for obesity, Tim notes their remarkable effectiveness in weight loss compared to previous drug innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. He believes that branding alone is not enough for long-term differentiation in this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>. The key challenge for Eucalyptus is to develop a service layer, using technology to lower the cost and raise the quality of interactions with healthcare professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. This "multi-practitioner support journey" alongside medication aims to help people sustain weight loss through behavior change, similar to how Hollywood celebrities achieve it with extensive support teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.

## Hiring and Talent Cultivation

Eucalyptus is known for hiring strong talent and transforming them into effective startup operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. Tim admits they initially trivialized the amount of "deprogramming and programming" required for new hires, especially ex-consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>.

[[leadership_lessons_and_company_building_in_the_tech_industry | Lessons from scaling and entrepreneurship]]:
*   **Narrower Skill Set:** The necessary skills for successful operators are narrower and deeper than initially thought. Academic achievement isn't enough; confident adversity, drive to execution, and analytical rigor are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>.
*   **Bridging Skills:** Early on, they failed to provide an adequate bridge between incoming skills and required startup skills, leading to some setting up for failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.
*   **Attributes of a Good Operator:**
    *   First principles product thinkers who can solve consumer problems naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.
    *   Strong financial capability and literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.
    *   Highly disciplined, able to break down complex problems and execute incrementally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>. This "unsexiest skill set" is often the most valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>. The devil is in the transformation from conceptual to actual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_reflections_in_business_decision_making | Challenges and Reflections]]

Tim is highly reflective about his own weaknesses:
*   **Short Timeline:** He has a short timeline for seeing things work, leading to frequent changes in direction and confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.
*   **Low Ambition (Tech/Product):** He identifies as a "revenue truffle hound," constantly seeking the next revenue stream, which isn't always the best approach for building a platform business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>.
*   **Communication Style:** He struggles to switch from analytical, direct communication to more empathetic, people-oriented communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.
*   **Lack of Strong Vision:** At times, he has been too malleable, lacking a strong enough long-term vision for the product and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>.
*   **Written Communication:** He acknowledges not being a great written communicator, which is a crucial superpower in organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>.

He learns from the "pain of experience," citing the first half of 2022 at Eucalyptus as a particularly painful period of reflection when he blew out metrics by ignoring his core discipline, leading to redundancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.

## Australian Startup Ecosystem Insights

Tim expresses mixed feelings about the Australian startup ecosystem:
*   **Positive Outlook:** He is "stoked" about much of the ecosystem, particularly highlighting Canva's founders, Cliff Obrecht and Melanie Perkins, as incredibly good people who foster a generation of strong talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.
*   **Less Founder Worship, More Operator Exposure:** He would like to see less "founder worship" and more exposure for senior operators (e.g., Canva's early engineers and product people), who possess real-world experience from being in the "grind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.
*   **Venture Capitalists:** While he often satirizes VCs, he believes most Australian VCs, especially the larger ones, have been genuinely supportive and ambitious, which is a positive differentiator from other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.
*   **Critique of Junior VCs:** He holds a controversial opinion that "99% of Australia's junior VCs add no value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>. He argues their apprenticeship model is broken, as they are often the first point of contact for founders without sufficient training or experience, and they lack the "reps" in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. He advises young, smart people to build something or work for someone who is building, rather than optimizing for early investment returns in VC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>.

### Ideas vs. Execution

Tim believes that "good ideas are rare" and that designing teams, forums, and cultures capable of producing them is much more difficult than execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>. He values creative brilliance that can generate "step change moments," even if it means tolerating unconventional work habits, as illustrated by his colleague Michael Beveridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>.

## Quick Takes and Personal Reflections

*   **Favorite Book:** *Zero to One* by Peter Thiel, noting its continued relevance despite its lessons being widely adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.
*   **Favorite Podcast:** *Founders* by David Senra, for its sheer volume of content and ability to recommend new books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.
*   **Favorite Hobby:** Running, specifically 10K runs done quickly, for its therapeutic benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:35">[01:05:35]</a>.
*   **Founders Looked Up To:** Alex Badran (Spriggy) and Rory San Miguel (Propeller), for their "non-linear success stories" and building great cultures over long grinds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>.
*   **Best Thinking Environment:** Small group problem-solving meetings (5 people, 90 minutes, good pre-read) where he draws energy from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.
*   **Source of Reflection:** The "pain of experience," particularly moments of failure, which force ownership and self-assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>.
*   **What he'd do with $100M:**
    *   **Impact:** Work with big-idea, early-stage founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>.
    *   **Financial Returns:** Raise a mid-market private equity firm to acquire and optimize "Boomer retiring businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>.
    *   **Fun:** Live in different places around the world, moving every quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:33">[01:09:33]</a>.
*   **Role of Art:** Appreciates long-form writing, particularly journalism, for its well-articulated storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.
*   **What Made Him Happiest Recently:** Getting married in Sweden, valuing the opportunity to reflect on relationships and gather all important people in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>.
*   **Alternative Career to Startups/Marketing:** Restaurants, specifically the system design of a restaurant and how menus are constructed to drive sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37">[01:12:37]</a>. He dislikes how many venues optimize for big, shared steak dishes, losing character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.
*   **Billboard Message for the World:** "The downside of most bets is smaller than you imagine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>, encouraging people to take more leaps as losses are often less severe than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>.

Duncan Anderson, co-founder of [[edrolos_impact_on_education | Edrolo]], provides a deep dive into the fundamental challenges facing the contemporary education system, arguing that significant improvements are necessary for the future of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:00">[32:32:00]</a>. His insights stem from a career focused on education and personal growth, highlighting key areas where the system falls short in fostering genuine learning and preparing individuals for a rapidly changing world.

## Curriculum and Student Engagement
A primary concern is that current curriculums often fail to engage students effectively. Duncan notes that while curriculums *can* be interesting, they are "unfortunately often boring for many of the students that go through the existing school system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This leads to a prevalent issue of rote learning, where students memorize information without true understanding across various subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

> "People will just rote learn right learning every subject math science... humanities it's actually the same thing you don't understand so it doesn't matter what the content is you're just rote learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>

This lack of understanding and engagement often results in students disliking or even hating their educational resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>, eventually leading them to "switch off from school and stop trying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:57:00">[31:57:00]</a>.

## Skills Gap and the Future Workforce
A more profound challenge identified is the education system's role in preparing individuals for a future where repetitive jobs are increasingly automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:00">[30:52:00]</a>. Duncan emphasizes that if individuals cannot perform non-repetitive tasks or upgrade their skills, they may become part of what he terms the "useless class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:05:00">[31:05:00]</a>.

> "We're kind of in a race against the machines to have humans be upgraded to the point where they can upgrade themselves or do non-repetitive jobs else we don't have jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:09:00">[31:09:00]</a>

This poses an "existential risk" if a large portion of the population requires universal basic income due to a lack of adaptable skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:38:00">[31:38:00]</a>. He cites research suggesting that only about a third of people in developed countries reach a point where they can self-upgrade, a figure he believes should be closer to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19:00">[30:19:00]</a>.

## Systemic Inertia and Resource Quality
Changing the education system's core structure, such as curriculums, is extremely difficult; it's often said to be "easier to move a cemetery that needs to change a curriculum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:44:00">[34:44:00]</a>. This inertia means that efforts should focus on improving existing mechanisms rather than waiting for radical overhauls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:08:00">[35:08:00]</a>.

A significant issue lies in the quality of educational resources. Unlike traditional publishers who spend less time on research and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:03:00">[39:03:00]</a>, [[edrolos_impact_on_education | Edrolo]] dedicates substantial time to creating engaging and understandable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:59:00">[38:59:00]</a>. Duncan likens it to novels: a good book keeps you up all night, while a bad one puts you to sleep, even if the technology is the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>. The difference is the "content quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:48:00">[25:48:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The Easiness Bias
> A crucial challenge in implementing improvements is the human tendency to choose the path of least resistance. Duncan observes that even when a "hard option is a large improvement to education and the easy option is a small improvement... 90% will do the easy option" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:48:00">[52:48:00]</a>. This "ease of use" factor, or UX, is critical for adoption, meaning a "medium with minimum effort" might be more impactful than a "large with high effort" improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:22:00">[53:22:00]</a>.

The goal, therefore, is not to fundamentally alter the curriculum or system, but to transform the quality of resources so that they elicit a "love of learning" and teach students how to teach themselves new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:03:00">[32:03:00]</a>. This focus on making existing content interesting and useful, rather than requiring new curriculums or significant additional funding, is seen as the most actionable way to address the current [[the_future_of_education_and_online_learning | challenges in education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07:00">[32:07:00]</a>.

The future of [[artificial_intelligence_and_workforce_transformation | AI-powered services firms]] and the integration of AI tools within communication strategies are significant topics in the evolving business landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The "AI Services Thesis" suggests that AI can enable software-like outcomes within services firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

## The AI Services Thesis in Communications

The "AI Services Thesis" posits an opportunity to leverage AI tools to enhance the work of Public Relations (PR) and communications professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>. This approach aims to make PR and communications more effective and efficient, potentially leading to venture-scale opportunities, although the jury is still out on that specific aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>.

## Practical Applications of AI in PR and Comms

### Trend Identification and Newsjacking
One key application of AI tools in communications is the identification of emerging trends and "newsjacking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>. Conceptualized AI tooling could:
*   **Crawl numerous publications and social media platforms** such as TikTok, Reddit sub-forums, and Hacker News <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Identify keywords** that are gaining traction within specific sub-communities, especially those known for influencing mainstream trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>.
*   **Spot trends** early, such as the rise of run clubs or longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>. This early detection could provide a lead time (e.g., two months) before a trend becomes mainstream in a different market like Australia, allowing companies to align their strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.

This capability enables brands to participate in trending news cycles by demonstrating how their products or services align with these emerging cultural movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

### Content Ideation and Outbound Motion
AI tools can also fuel outbound communication motions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>. For example, if an AI identifies "run clubs" as an emerging trend, a communications agency could proactively approach health and wellness companies or social platforms like Bumble, suggesting they create a "Bumble run club" to capitalize on the trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>.

## The Human Element in AI-Powered Strategies
Despite the capabilities of AI, human involvement remains crucial. An AI tool can accelerate the identification of clues and trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>. However, a human "taste-maker" is still needed to:
*   **Identify what is truly happening** and why certain trends are resonating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>.
*   **Determine if a cultural moment will spread globally** or remain a local phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.
*   **Ensure the quality and relevance of the identified trends** for specific clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>.

The role of [[The evolving role of AI in software engineering and product management | AI]] is to augment human work, allowing for the delivery of "awesome epic campaigns" and providing opportunities for clients to newsjack cycles more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.

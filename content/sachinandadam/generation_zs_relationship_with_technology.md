Rex Woodbury, a Venture Capitalist and author of *Digital Native*, offers insights into consumer behavior, consumer investing, and the [[the_intersection_of_technology_and_human_behavior | intersection of technology and human behavior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:17">[02:16:17]</a>. His interest in [[the_intersection_of_technology_and_human_behavior | human behavior]] and culture led him to a career in tech and venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>. He believes [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technology is the story of our time]] and that entrepreneurship is a mechanism for [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | social change and cultural change]] at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:56">[03:54:56]</a>.

## The First Digitally Native Generation

Gen Z is considered the first truly digitally native generation, having come of age online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:01">[02:24:01]</a>. Unlike previous generations, who might have used early internet services like AOL or MySpace, Gen Z grew up with mobile-native [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technology]], such as iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:06">[02:24:06]</a>. This generation "just loves their phones," even if they acknowledge potential negative effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:01">[02:42:01]</a>. The sheer amount of time, engagement, and mind share that young people have with [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technology]], the internet, and [[the_future_of_social_media_and_digital_interaction | social media]] is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:55">[02:54:55]</a>.

## Impact of Technology: Optimism vs. Concerns

There's ongoing discussion, especially with recent studies, about how smartphones and [[the_future_of_social_media_and_digital_interaction | social media]] affect mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:40">[02:28:40]</a>. Rex Woodbury maintains a "perpetual Tech Optimist" stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:38">[02:38:38]</a>. He argues that historically, new [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technologies]] (like TV or the printing press) have always faced backlash and anxiety, but ultimately, the positives outweigh the negatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:45">[02:44:45]</a>.

While acknowledging a strong correlation between the inflection of smartphone/social media adoption and worsening mental health among teen girls around 2009-2010, Woodbury notes that other factors like increased homework stress or car-centric cities making in-person friendships harder could also contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:52">[02:51:52]</a>. He believes that over-reliance on online engagement can detract from the richness of offline connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:50">[02:52:50]</a>. However, he remains optimistic about the potential for future [[the_future_of_social_media_and_digital_interaction | social apps]] to inspire more authentic connections, potentially by helping people find belonging online and then encouraging real-world interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:36">[02:53:36]</a>. He suggests that policy may need to play a role in regulating the excesses of [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | new technology]] where ad-driven business models incentivize more time spent on devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:57">[02:59:57]</a>.

### Finding Community and Belonging
One of the positive aspects of the internet for Gen Z is its ability to help individuals find community and belonging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:08">[03:19:08]</a>. The internet makes the world global, introducing people to new individuals and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:05">[03:26:05]</a>. For example, an organization called Worthy, which matches LGBTQ+ mentors with mentees, grew entirely through Instagram, allowing individuals from conservative areas to find specific guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:41">[03:41:41]</a>.

## Evolving [[the_future_of_social_media_and_digital_interaction | Social Media]] and Online Attention

A significant shift in [[the_future_of_social_media_and_digital_interaction | social media]] is the reduced time spent interacting with friends and acquaintances (typical of "social media 1.0" like Facebook and Instagram) and an increase in meeting strangers or forming parasocial relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:51">[03:50:51]</a>. Platforms like TikTok, Discord, and Reddit connect people globally, often based on shared interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:59">[03:10:59]</a>.

The [[the_future_of_social_media_and_digital_interaction | next social network]] may resemble a game, like Minecraft or Roblox, merging creation and play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:26">[03:26:26]</a>. This indicates a broader trend of online experiences merging social interaction, entertainment, and the [[trends_in_technology_and_gig_economy | Creator economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:50">[03:49:50]</a>. For instance, games like Fortnite provide an "unconscious drive for socialization" among players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:40">[03:28:40]</a>.

## New Avenues for Work and Living

Gen Z's "jadedness around capitalism and nihilism" is similar to Millennials who came of age during the Great Recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:50">[03:49:50]</a>. However, Gen Z has more alternatives for earning a living and dictating their lives online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:59">[03:10:59]</a>. This includes being a TikToker, YouTuber, live stream seller (e.g., on Whatnot), running a boutique store on Flagship, or being a Discord or Roblox developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:15">[03:15:15]</a>. These "digitally native work" or [[trends_in_technology_and_gig_economy | job creation platforms]] are enabling individuals to "afford their own path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:05">[03:35:05]</a>.

For example, Amazon's third-party sellers far outnumber its direct employees, and YouTube enables many more people to earn a living than those directly employed at its headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:47">[03:48:47]</a>.

### Consumer Behavior and Values
Gen Z's values also influence consumer choices. For example, Beam, a company Woodbury invested in, embeds [[social_impact_and_innovation_in_emerging_technologies | social impact]] into the checkout experience for brands, aligning with Gen Z's desire to reflect their values when shopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

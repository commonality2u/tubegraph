Building an organization that extends its focus beyond just profit is a core principle for companies like Canva. Cam Adams, co-founder of Canva, highlights the intentional decision to create a different kind of organization, one that prioritizes giving back and considering its broader impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Defining Social Responsibility
Canva's approach to social responsibility is deeply ingrained in its [[building_company_culture_and_founder_mindset | company's DNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. From its inception, the company aimed to think "beyond the bottom line" and "beyond shareholder value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This philosophy means providing value to every individual involved with Canva, including investors, customers, and even people who may not be directly aware of the company but could be affected by its decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

This commitment naturally extends to:
*   **The Planet**: Considering environmental impact, which for Canva includes a passion for climate and future sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Social Equity and Justice**: Addressing broader societal concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Personal Values and Company DNA
Cam Adams' personal passion for climate and nature significantly influences Canva's commitment to these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of a future for the planet and specifically mentions interest in nature-based solutions for climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This interest is also shared with his wife, who is a zoologist and has an even deeper love of nature and animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Canva is seen as an archetypical example of an Australian startup where the founders prioritize giving back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This [[intersection_of_business_and_social_impact | intersection of business and social impact]] is a foundational aspect of the company.

## Structuring for Impact
To ensure effective giving back, the organization itself has been structured in a way that facilitates this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This foundational setup allows Canva to consistently act on its values related to the planet and social equity.

Tim Fung, co-founder of AirTasker, offers valuable [[founder_experiences_and_strategies_in_tech_startups | insights]] into the evolving nature of execution and leadership within startups, drawing from his journey building a significant and impactful company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## The Evolving Nature of Execution

Execution in a startup is not static; it changes significantly, often year by year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Initial Phase: Courage and Naivety
At the very beginning, execution has little to do with intellect or skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. It primarily requires:
*   **Courage** To put yourself out there and risk being laughed at or failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   **Naivety** A belief that failure won't happen to you, enabling you to "just go for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

### Developing Core Skills
After the initial leap, the next phase involves developing crucial skills specific to the company's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. These can include:
*   Software engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>
*   Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>
*   Capital raising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>

Founders must either become proficient in these areas or hire individuals who possess these capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

### Shifting Focus to Empowerment
As a company scales, execution transitions from individual heroic efforts to empowering others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. This requires founders to become less selfish about being the "hero" who closes deals or runs campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. It involves creating a platform where others can achieve success and receive recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This shift is challenging for founders who are used to directly "kicking those goals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

## Leadership in a Scaling Startup

### Challenges in Scaling
Scaling a company like AirTasker, which currently employs around 175 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, presents distinct challenges compared to the initial startup phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

*   **Marketplace vs. SaaS:** The traditional startup playbook, often geared towards SaaS companies (bootstrapping, finding product-market fit with a small user base, then scaling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, doesn't apply to marketplaces built on user-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. For marketplaces, scale *is* the product; connectivity is key (e.g., Facebook, telephone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   **Early Focus on Growth:** For AirTasker, early skills revolved around experimentation and growth, rather than just product and engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. This involved "hacking growth" with generalists who could do "whatever it takes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   **Later Focus on Product:** As the company matures, the focus shifts to becoming more product-centric, with strong data science and machine learning expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

### Mental Resilience and Mindset
Dealing with stress and challenging moments is crucial for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **Changing Physical Mindset:** Tim's personal quirk is smiling when stressed, which helps take him out of a fearful physical state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. Other methods include physical activity like push-ups or jogging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.
*   **Facing Challenges:**
    *   **Capital:** Running out of money is a "harrowing experience," despite the Silicon Valley mythology that money "sorts itself out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
    *   **People Issues:** Firing someone for the first time or undergoing restructures are among the hardest things a leader has to do, genuinely keeping them up at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.

### Leadership Philosophy and Advice
*   **Curiosity over Judgment:** Drawing from "Change Your Questions, Change Your Life," a leader should approach situations from a curious position rather than a judgmental one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. This helps in understanding people and situations rather than reinforcing preconceived notions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
*   **Dealing with Ambiguity:** Inspired by "Thinking in Bets" by Annie Duke, a leader must be able to deal with a lot of ambiguity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. Humans often try to simplify life, but in a startup, that's often counterintuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. For example, a revenue forecast for a startup might make you feel safe but not change how you operate the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. Embracing "I don't know" can be the right answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.
*   **Empowering the Team:** Instead of micromanaging, a leader defines the mission and goals, incentivizes achievement, and allows smart people to figure out how to get there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. This approach is applied to the AirTasker platform, where clear objectives (more completed jobs, low cancellations) are set, and taskers are incentivized to achieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>.
*   **Resilience and Rejection:** A key piece of [[advice_on_entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | advice on entrepreneurship and startup success]] is to "get ready to kiss a lot of frogs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. Founders should expect 95% of people to not support their ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. While often those critics are right, the ability to push through rejection is a powerful trait for young people starting out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.

## Influences and Inspirations
*   **Michael Schumacher:** Admired for his ability to [[leadership_lessons_and_company_building_in_the_tech_industry | build a high-performance team]] around him, being caring and respected while setting an incredibly high bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.

## Conclusion

Tim Fung's journey with AirTasker underscores that successful [[building_a_successful_tech_startup | startup development]] requires not just a good idea, but a dynamic approach to execution and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. This includes adapting skills as the company grows, fostering a resilient mindset, and empowering teams by focusing on mission and incentives rather than micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

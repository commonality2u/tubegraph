Rex Woodbury, a partner at Index Ventures and author of "Digital Native," has forged a career path deeply rooted in his personal experiences and a keen interest in human behavior and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. His journey reflects a constant evolution, balancing ambition with a search for intrinsic motivation and impactful work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

## Early Life and Driving Forces

Woodbury's early life was significantly shaped by his family. His father, a doctor by profession, was a "renaissance man" with a strong creative streak, cultivating interests in film, reading, and writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. Woodbury even starred as a baby in one of his father's films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, which "ignited his love of film" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. The family, consisting of his father, brother, and himself after his mother passed away when he was one, formed a "very tight nuclear family unit" known as "the Three Musketeers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

Woodbury identifies as someone "quite ambitious and driven and a bit of a workaholic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. He attributes much of this drive to an early realization of being different as a gay man, internalizing shame, and redirecting that energy into external pursuits like being a "perfect student" or a "great athlete" to gain validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. While he has since undertaken significant introspection to ensure his motivations are intrinsic and true to himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>, he acknowledges that early traumas and experiences, though overcome, can leave a lasting impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. He observes a similar phenomenon in many driven entrepreneurs who possess a "chip on their shoulder" from past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.

His ambition was also nurtured by his father, who, without pushing, encouraged and supported his children to achieve what they desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. Throughout his career, Woodbury has consistently grappled with the tension between career achievement and time spent with loved ones, a challenge he notes only becomes more complex with family and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.

## The Shift to Venture Capital

Woodbury's initial career steps were in traditional finance, including investment banking at Goldman Sachs and later-stage investing at TPG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. He describes this period as being "trained in a very right brain way," indicating a focus on analytical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>. Despite these roles, his core interest remained in human behavior and culture, leading him to obsess over trends in box office numbers, best-seller lists, and music charts from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. He viewed technology as the "story of our time" and entrepreneurship as a "mechanism for social change and cultural change at scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:00">[17:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>.

He acknowledges a slight regret about not understanding his true passions earlier, feeling he followed a path prescribed for "smartest kids" rather than what authentically interested him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>. However, he values the training he received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a>. His career began to shift when he started writing more about his interests and spending time with people and topics that energized him, rather than feeling "forced" into financial engineering roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>. This led him to align his time and energy with his true passions, which he describes as being drawn to the "business section but also arts and style and culture and life's life and more about humans and people" in a newspaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>. This alignment ultimately brought him to venture capital, specifically focusing on consumer behavior.

## Investment Philosophy and Superpowers

As a venture capitalist, Woodbury takes a broad view of "consumer" investing, including B2B and B2B2C models, recognizing that pure consumer social investments can be rare despite large potential outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:24:00">[35:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38:00">[35:38:00]</a>. He emphasizes being "change aware" rather than "fully thesis driven," focusing on major "tectonic shifts happening in the economy and in human behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:00">[37:00:00]</a>. His approach is "entrepreneur-led," believing that exceptional entrepreneurs are often years ahead in their thinking and can create new categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:09:00">[37:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:15:00">[37:15:00]</a>.

Key qualities he looks for in entrepreneurs include:
*   **Founder-market fit**: An "unfair advantage" or lived experience that gives them unique insight into the problem or opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:52:00">[39:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:55:00">[39:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00:00">[40:00:00]</a>.
*   **Clarity of thought**: The ability to understand the "order of operations" and how things will unfold to build a large company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:40:00">[39:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:47:00">[39:47:00]</a>.
*   **Unique insight**: An ability to view the world in a way that the investor hasn't considered, offering a "net new way of thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:56:00">[39:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04:00">[40:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:26:00">[40:26:00]</a>.

Woodbury stresses the importance of avoiding biases in venture, such as those against minority or female investors, or relying solely on "pattern matching" from past successful companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:53:00">[41:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:07:00">[42:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:23:00">[42:23:00]</a>. He believes that the world is constantly changing, and investors need to have an "open mind" and constantly challenge their own calcified biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51:00">[42:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:22:00">[43:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:39:00">[43:39:00]</a>.

When asked about his "superpowers," Woodbury highlights his ability to quickly build relationships through an enthusiastic and empathetic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:27:00">[51:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:33:00">[51:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:42:00">[51:42:00]</a>. He also points to his "pulse or a sense of the Zeitgeist," particularly in marketing and product growth, and his "work ethic and hustle," believing that "most of success for anyone can come from outworking other people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:58:00">[51:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:05:00">[52:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:23:00">[52:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:28:00">[52:28:00]</a>. He advises young investors to "learn in public," particularly through long-form writing, as a way to synthesize ideas, stress-test them, and create "serendipity at scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:40:00">[45:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:49:00">[45:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:56:00">[45:56:00]</a>. This approach leverages individual skills and passions to build a professional brand.

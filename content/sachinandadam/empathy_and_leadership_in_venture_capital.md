Alicia McDonald, a partner at AirTree Ventures, one of Australia's largest venture capital funds, embodies a unique blend of empathy and competitive drive in her [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | venture capital]] career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. She is known for her high intellect and deep empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>, which she attributes to her upbringing and personal values.

## Balancing Career and Personal Life
McDonald emphasizes that while her career is a significant part of her identity, it is not her entire life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. As a partner at a VC fund with three children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>, she prioritizes having a full life outside of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. This philosophy aligns with one of AirTree's core values: "There is more to life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

Her husband, Tom, describes her as a "machine," not in a cold-hearted sense, but due to her high tolerance for stress and ability to manage multiple responsibilities without often feeling overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. This capacity to thrive in busy environments stems from being a driven and ambitious person who gets satisfaction from achieving a lot and easily gets bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

## Impact of Early Life Experiences
McDonald's balanced perspective on life's stresses comes from her childhood experiences, particularly her mother's long battle with brain cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. Witnessing her mother's resilience and determination instilled in McDonald a deep appreciation for life and a drive to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. She feels an obligation to live as full and happy a life as possible to honor her mother's legacy and sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>.

This perspective helps her compartmentalize challenges and avoid dwelling on negative things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:50:00">[37:50:00]</a>, enabling her to constantly context-switch between personal and professional demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>.

## Empathy in Venture Capital
McDonald's empathy is a natural trait, not something she consciously developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>. She instinctively views problems from multiple perspectives and considers the impact of decisions on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. While competitive in team activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>, she rejects the idea that success means leaving "a trail of destruction, broken relationships, broken trust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>. For her, true success is about winning as a team, working alongside [[execution_and_leadership_in_startups | founders]] and colleagues for a shared victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>.

She prefers a "sales-led origination" approach over a "marketing-led" one, focusing on building a brand and reputation based on actions rather than words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:00">[19:56:00]</a>. Her experience in B2B sales at LinkedIn provides her with operational credibility and deep empathy for the challenges faced by early-stage [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | founders]], such as managing quotas while seeking product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Winning Deals and Founder Relationships
In a competitive [[venture_capital_strategies_and_deal_winning | deal winning]] environment, McDonald emphasizes understanding the specific needs of a company and genuinely believing AirTree can add value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:36:00">[22:36:00]</a>. She recounts winning a deal despite offering slightly lower terms, solely due to the trust she had built with the [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | founder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>. She advises [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | founders]] by transparently discussing the pros and cons of different options, even if it doesn't always lead to a direct win for AirTree in the short term, as it builds a long-term reputation based on honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>.

Her edge in [[venture_capital_strategies_and_deal_winning | venture capital]] involves finding "rough diamonds" â€“ deals that others are not yet looking at, which are often contrarian but lead to the best returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:00">[26:40:00]</a>. She values meeting [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | founders]] from diverse backgrounds, caring more about their unique perspective on a problem and their burning desire to solve it than their existing network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:09:00">[27:09:00]</a>.

## Qualities in Founders
In initial meetings, McDonald looks for [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | founders]] who exhibit a deep, unfakeable passion for solving a problem, often one they have personally experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:44:00">[28:44:00]</a>. She is interested in *why* they are uniquely positioned to solve it and *why* they feel compelled to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>. While not expecting an "egotistical" pitch, she seeks a genuine drive and resilience necessary to navigate the inevitable setbacks of building a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:22:00">[31:22:00]</a>.

She values self-awareness in [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | founders]], particularly their ability to identify their strengths and weaknesses and build complimentary teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:57:00">[31:57:00]</a>. For early-stage [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | founders]] without extensive work history, she infers resilience from their deep passion, believing that intrinsic motivation is crucial for enduring the "tough journey" of a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:16:00">[33:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:48:00">[34:48:00]</a>.

## Personal Values and Advice
McDonald's core values include:
*   **Authenticity:** Not projecting an image that doesn't match reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:35:00">[46:35:00]</a>.
*   **Achievement:** A drive to achieve as much as possible in her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:47:00">[46:47:00]</a>.
*   **Family:** Being a good parent and valuing her loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:56:00">[46:56:00]</a>.
*   **Empathy:** Thinking deeply about the impact she leaves on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:02:00">[47:02:00]</a>.
*   **Happiness and Gratitude:** Maintaining a positive outlook and appreciating life's blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:34:00">[47:34:00]</a>.

For young ambitious women who want both a happy family life and a successful career, McDonald advises:
1.  **Find the right company:** One where your values align with the company's values, such as AirTree's "more to life" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:16:00">[49:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:40:00">[49:40:00]</a>.
2.  **Love what you do:** As advised in "Lean In," find a job you love before having children, because you won't want to leave them for something you don't care deeply about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:56:00">[49:56:00]</a>.
3.  **Think tactically:** Consider childcare costs as a household expense, not just against one's salary, and plan for superannuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27:00">[50:27:00]</a>.
4.  **Trust outputs over "FaceTime":** Hire great people, trust them to do a good job, and measure them on results rather than hours spent in the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:44:00">[51:44:00]</a>.

She emphasizes that dating a [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | founder]] can be challenging due to the demanding nature of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:13:00">[44:13:00]</a>. A supportive partner, whether inside or outside the industry, is vital for a [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | founder]]'s success, as they provide a crucial outlet for venting and support during stressful times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:03:00">[43:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:27:00">[43:27:00]</a>. The ability to draw boundaries between work and home life is especially complex for husband-and-wife teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:13:00">[43:13:00]</a>.

Catherine Boyle, a General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a6z), has deep, intentional beliefs about various aspects of life, including family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. For her, having a family was always a "Northstar" and core to her identity from childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

## Personal Approach to Balancing Career and Family

When asked about [[Juggling Parenthood and Entrepreneurship | cultivating being a great mother and a superstar in her career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>, Catherine emphasizes that there is "no balance, it is always chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:48">[00:49:48]</a>. She credits her upbringing in a multigenerational household, where she was supported by grandparents, aunts, and other family members, as a key factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>.

A "wise woman," a famous executive in Silicon Valley, once told Catherine that "You can have a family, you could have a career, you can have friends and you can have community, but you can only have two at the same time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Catherine has chosen to prioritize her family and career, acknowledging that this means cutting out other aspects of her life, such as being a very good friend or community member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>. She hopes to revisit these relationships later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>.

Catherine also relies heavily on her mother, who is the day-to-day caretaker for her children, allowing for this intense focus on both family and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. This arrangement reflects a return to the historical model of large, multigenerational families raising children with extended family support, rather than solely nuclear families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

## Societal Implications and Policy

From a broader policy perspective, Catherine believes that to facilitate "American dynamism," there must be policies that are "pro family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>. She points to experiments globally that encourage procreation and stronger families through policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.

A fundamental agreement that "families are a good thing" is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. Catherine highlights that children born into intact families tend to have much better outcomes later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. Therefore, encouraging family formation where children are well cared for is extremely important for American dynamism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>.

> "Families are the thing that lead to better outcomes for adults...a child born into an intact family is going to have a much better outcome later in life than children who are not" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>

Sahil Bloom is recognized as an investor, entrepreneur, and content creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. His career began in private equity before he started creating content in early 2020, leading to a significant rise in his online presence by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. He recently became the managing partner at SRB Ventures, a venture capital fund focused on investing in future companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## SRB Ventures: Investment Philosophy

SRB Ventures is an [[Investing in startups and earlystage companies | early-stage venture fund]] that focuses on making "big swings" by investing in high-risk, high-reward opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Sahil looks for companies with the potential to become $10 billion businesses, specifically seeking out game-changing technologies or solutions in large markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. He has no desire to invest in ventures that, even if successful, would only be worth $20-40 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

From a founder's perspective, Sahil prioritizes resilience and gritâ€”the ability to face setbacks and recover quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. He believes it is challenging to bet against individuals who consistently demonstrate this quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.

## Angel Investing: Early Challenges and Learnings

Before establishing SRB Ventures, Sahil engaged in [[Venture capital and angel investing | angel investing]], backing over 30 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. His initial [[Investing in startups and earlystage companies | investment strategy]] relied exclusively on his personal networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

### The "Adverse Selection" Problem

A significant [[Challenges and strategies in venture investing | challenge in private investing]] is adverse selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. Early in an investor's career, without a strong platform or significant value-add, one should be cautious of opportunities that are readily presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. If an opportunity is truly exciting, founders would likely approach well-established VCs or high-profile individuals first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. Some of Sahil's initial mistakes stemmed from not being wary of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

### Gaining Access and Building Networks

As Sahil's profile grew, his deal flow improved because he could offer tangible value, such as leveraging his distribution platform to amplify narratives and gain visibility for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. To gain experience and refine assessment criteria, he emphasizes the need for "reps" (repetitions) and being present in influential circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

### Considering Non-Financial Returns

Sahil advises considering a broader definition of "returns" beyond just financial gain when making early investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. He recounts an investment in a deal led by David Sacks, a renowned software investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Despite initial financial reservations, Sahil invested $10,000, viewing it as a valuable opportunity to build a relationship and learn from Sacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. This strategic move provided significant long-term benefits, including future deal collaborations and mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

## The Evolving Landscape of [[Venture capital and angel investing | Venture Capital and Angel Investing]]

Sahil believes the nature of [[Venture capital Strategies and Deal Winning | angel investing]] and [[Venture capital and angel investing | early-stage venture capital]] is undergoing a significant transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

### Impact of Social Media and Personal Branding

The rise of individuals leveraging large distribution channels like Twitter and Substack to then pursue investments is a unique trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. This public presence allows investors like Sahil to be helpful to portfolio companies by amplifying their narrative and getting eyes on their initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

### The "Barbell" Theory

Sahil observes a "barbell" effect forming in the venture landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>:
*   **One end:** Large, established venture capital firms (e.g., Benchmark, Sequoia, Andreessen, Tiger) with immense cachet that founders desire on their cap table for immediate impact upon announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.
*   **The other end:** Individuals like Sahil Bloom, Packy McCormack, and Julian Shapiro who have raised funds and offer a specific, impactful value-add to companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. These investors typically write smaller checks ($100k-$250k), resulting in minimal dilution for the company while delivering a "massively outsized impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.
*   **The squeezed middle:** Mid-tier VCs with small to medium-sized funds are struggling to differentiate themselves and are being "squished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.

This model allows individual investors to secure "differentiated deal flow" as larger funds may send them opportunities, viewing them as complementary rather than competitive due to their smaller check sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.

## Key Skills for Success: Building vs. Selling

For those starting their careers, particularly in their 20s, Sahil advises identifying whether one is primarily a "builder" or a "salesperson" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. While individuals proficient in both are "unbeatable," it's crucial to master one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.

Sahil identifies himself as a "salesperson," emphasizing that "selling" is a broad skill encompassing the ability to sell ideas, investments, and oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>. His private equity career taught him how to "storytell," identify and learn ideas, and present complex information clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. Learning to sell is considered a highly valuable skill because it enables individuals to convince others to take chances on them, which has been a recurring theme in Sahil's own career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.

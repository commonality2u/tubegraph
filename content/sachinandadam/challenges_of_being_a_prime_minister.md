The role of a Prime Minister is described as "one of the most arduous and difficult tasks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. It involves a significant amount of constant stress and the necessity of managing both people and their expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Key Challenges Identified

### Managing Physical Exhaustion
One of the primary [[balancing_personal_intensity_and_maintaining_longevity_in_leadership | challenges]] for a Prime Minister is avoiding physical exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. Politicians in modern times are campaigning constantly, leading to schedules that can start at 6:30 AM and finish at midnight, packed with people and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

To combat this, a "golden rule" in the Prime Minister's office was "don't kill the candidate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. The importance of rest is emphasized because a tired politician will not perform well; they need to be lively and interested for public appearances on radio or television, and when meeting people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

### Navigating Political Logjams
The role also entails navigating political obstacles, such as ideological deadlocks within government. An example cited is the "toxic... train wreck traffic jam... log jam inside the coalition" where logical policies, like the transition to clean energy, are hindered by "ideological fetish over coal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. This means confronting situations where the country is "increasingly out of step with our closest friends and allies on climate and energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.

### Maintaining a Sense of Self
Despite the intense demands, some individuals, like Malcolm Turnbull, state they did not find it hard to retain a sense of self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. For Turnbull, the job was stressful but "never got me down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. He consistently slept well, viewing a good night's sleep as important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. His approach to managing stress was to focus on avoiding physical exhaustion rather than letting concerns keep him awake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

## Essential Qualities for a Leader
A crucial skill for a leader to develop is listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. In politics, enjoying people's company and being interested in their stories is essential for effective politicians, as it is fundamentally a "people business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. Those who are misanthropic may find politics to be a very odd fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

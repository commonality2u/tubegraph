Nikki S., a prominent figure in the Australian venture capital scene and co-founder of Blackbird and Startmate, views investing as deeply intertwined with human nature and historical patterns, rather than purely an exercise in financial modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Blackbird, under his guidance, has seen its portfolio companies generate over $10 billion in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Psychology's Influence on Investment Decisions
Nikki S. asserts that successful investing is "much more psychological" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. It requires a profound understanding of why human beings behave as they do, both as investors and as founders.

### Emotional Regulation in Markets
Markets are driven by human emotions, leading to irrational decisions. When markets crash, people become emotional and tend to sell, despite it often being the optimal time to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Conversely, in booming markets, people can become overly confident and act like "smartest people in the room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Nikki S. likens emotional control in investing to a "mental gym," where one trains themselves to do the opposite of their instinctual, "chemical" reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. If prices are falling, the rational action is to buy more, assuming the underlying value remains intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Understanding Founders' Psychology
The psychological makeup of successful founders is equally critical in [[Startup growth and investor dynamics | venture investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Traits observed in "unique people who go on to do things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a> include:
*   Self-criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
*   A "chip on the shoulder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>
*   Holding themselves to a high bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>
*   Extreme speed of progress and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>

Only a small fraction (around 1%) of intelligent individuals translate their thoughts into action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Influential Psychological Thinkers
Nikki S. highlights several thinkers who have shaped his understanding of [[Philosophical and psychological influences on successful business leaders | psychology's role in investing]]:
*   **[[Philosophical and psychological influences on successful business leaders | Charlie Munger]]**: Described as his "absolute favorite person in business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, Munger is credited with popularizing "mental models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> and the importance of being widely read across various fields, including biology, to draw lessons applicable to investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Munger's "Poor Charlie's Almanack" is a key text for applying psychology to investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. His approach involves acknowledging human flaws and seeking out "the most beautiful business in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Dan Ariely**: Though the book title isn't mentioned, Ariely's work on behavioral flaws, cognitive biases, and the human "craving" for shortcuts (like social proof) is highlighted as crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Daniel Kahneman**: His book "Thinking, Fast and Slow" is noted as a great summary of his work on how people make decisions, the power of defaults, and how to design environments for better decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

Ultimately, a general interest in human behavior, its flaws, and how to avoid them, is deemed "so useful to everything in life and particularly investing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

## History's Lessons for Investment
History offers valuable insights for investors, particularly by revealing "where the most ambitious people spend their time at different points in history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **300 years ago**: Ambitious individuals might have been founding countries or exploring new civilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **1000 years ago**: Founding a religion might have been the pursuit of the most ambitious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

By studying how these ambitious individuals succeeded across different eras, investors can gain a broader perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Ray Dalio's "Changing World Order" is cited as a phenomenal example of viewing history through an investment lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

> "the pain is progress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>
> â€” Ray Dalio

Experiencing challenging market conditions ("mental triathlon") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a> is crucial for learning and hardening one's investment instincts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## Combining Disciplines for Venture Success
Blackbird's philosophy is rooted in these broader insights. The firm's success stems from "taking a chance on the hungry not the proven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, believing that significant change is often driven by "outsiders" with little to no prior business or CEO experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This contrasts with the mainstream idea that change comes from privileged insiders with years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

For aspiring investors or entrepreneurs, Nikki S. advises prioritizing environments that offer the highest rate of learning, such as joining a rapidly scaling startup (post-20 to post-50 employees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. This provides immense exposure to market dynamics, customer behavior, and internal organizational challenges, leading to rapid career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

### Key Takeaways for Investing
*   **Embrace Curiosity**: A foundational trait for understanding diverse domains and piecing together mental models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Train Your Emotions**: Counteract natural human instincts (e.g., selling in a downturn) through conscious effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Understand Human Nature**: Recognize the deep flaws and biases that influence both investors and entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

*   **Seek Deep Belief**: To achieve "generational returns" in investing, one must believe in something that "no one else believes in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.

*   **Imagination and Belief**: The number one skill of a great venture investor is "imagination," the ability to believe in potential when answers are not yet clear, and to trust a founder's ability to navigate challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

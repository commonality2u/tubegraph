Cam Adams, co-founder of Canva, shared his insights on climate change during an interview filmed at Climate Week in New York, hosted by an Australian VC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Engagement with Climate Week

Adams's presence at Climate Week in New York was a deliberate choice, as the event had been on his and Canva's list for a considerable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. He traveled to New York by train from Boston, which he noted positively for its lower carbon footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Personal Motivation

Adams's passion for climate action stems from a fundamental belief in the necessity of ensuring a future for the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. His interest is deeply connected to nature, a passion he shares with his wife, who is a zoologist with an even deeper love for nature and animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Together, they are very passionate about this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Their focus is largely on [[naturebased_solutions_for_climate_change|nature-based solutions for climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Canva's Approach to Social Responsibility

The commitment to giving back and addressing global issues like climate change is embedded in Canva's foundational philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. From its inception, Canva aimed to be an organization that extended beyond just the bottom line and shareholder value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The goal was to provide value to everyone involved with the company â€“ from investors and customers to those indirectly affected by Canva's decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This inclusive approach naturally leads Canva to consider its impact on the planet, as well as on social equity and justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The organization itself is structured to facilitate effective giving back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

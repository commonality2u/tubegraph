Cindy B, a prominent investor with a portfolio boasting 14 unicorns, offers insights into the key qualities she identifies in successful founders. Her observations are shaped by her own [[founder_experiences_and_strategies_in_tech_startups | experiences as a founder]] and operator, as well as her extensive work with numerous startups.

### The "Immigrant Mentality"

A significant characteristic Cindy B identifies in many successful founders is what she terms the "immigrant mentality" or [[motivation_and_background_of_successful_entrepreneurs | immigrant hustle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

> "Most immigrants by default they are big at taking risks, they left their family and they their friends... and they came here without much money and you have to make you have to make it work you cannot fail." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>

This inherent risk-taking and determination to succeed, driven by a lack of alternative options, aligns strongly with the nature of entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Cindy B notes that probably half or more than half of the 200+ companies in her portfolio have at least one immigrant founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This is not due to intentional searching but rather a natural alignment of characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The sheer determination of those who left everything behind, sometimes even dropping out of school, is a distinct trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

Quoting Josh Kushner, Cindy B emphasizes that "Excellence is a capacity to take pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Immigrants, by nature, have already experienced significant pain in adjusting to new cultures and taking massive risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### Core Qualities and Traits

Cindy B looks for several specific qualities when assessing founders:

*   **Tech-Savvy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>: A strong technical background is highly valued.
*   **Sales Ability/Love of Sales** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>: Founders who are natural at sales or genuinely enjoy it possess a "superpower."
*   **Team Dynamics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>: The presence of both technical and sales talent within the team is crucial.
*   **Storytelling** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>: The ability to articulate a compelling vision and story helps attract talent, especially when compensation is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
*   **Grit and Persistence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>: True grit is earned through life experiences and challenges, demonstrating an unwavering commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>.
*   **Never Give Up** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>: A persistent attitude, combined with a strong work ethic, is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
*   **Optimism** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>: Maintaining a positive outlook, even when faced with daily challenges and existential threats, is key for [[execution_and_leadership_in_startups | leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>.
*   **Ability to "Get Back Up" Quickly** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>: Like Novak Djokovic, successful founders don't wallow in sadness; they shorten the feedback loop between falling down and getting back up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. They must be able to "get up the next day with a fresh face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>.
*   **Enjoying the Hardship** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>: One investor likened founders to eating glass every day and enjoying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.

### The Role of Personal Experience

Cindy B's own personal experience, including a recent tragedy, has influenced her investment focus, particularly in areas like legal tech and healthcare AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. She believes that by finding companies that make these sectors more efficient, she can make a real impact and help many families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This ability to channel personal pain into productive work and positive impact is a quality she values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### The Underdog Mentality and Low Ego

Despite her success, Cindy B maintains an "underdog outsider mentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. She seeks out founders who also possess a low ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>.

> "I invite in funders or people with no no or low ego because that that makes you... make the right decision instead of proving yourself." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>

This approach fosters genuine, authentic relationships, which is essential for honest conversations and mutual support in the challenging journey of [[building_a_successful_tech_startup | building a successful tech startup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>.

[[Tim Fung]] is recognized as an [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_mindset | entrepreneurial legend]] in Sydney, known for founding AirTasker, a significant and impactful marketplace for outsourcing jobs and tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Before starting AirTasker, Fung completed a Bachelor of Commerce at UNSW and spent four years in investment banking at Macquarie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Early Career and Entrepreneurial Leanings

While at Macquarie, Tim Fung realized the corporate environment wasn't a long-term fit for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. An anecdote that highlighted this realization involved a peanut butter jar: when thirsty, Fung used a clean peanut butter jar as a water receptacle because no glasses were available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. A director reacted with surprise, leading Fung to reflect on the "in-the-box" thinking prevalent in large corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Though he valued his time at Macquarie for its high-performance culture and applicable lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, he saw it as a temporary phase rather than a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Fung's unique observations and unconventional ideas were sometimes labeled "fungisms" by colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. He recounts an instance at a Japanese barbecue where hot coals evaporated rain, a phenomenon he found remarkably rare and worth pointing out, which others found "stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This experience reinforced his understanding that people trying to do something different will often be told they are wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. He believes this willingness to challenge norms is part of the [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_mindset | entrepreneurial spirit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Fung's childhood, particularly his father's mentorship, fostered a practical thinking approach and encouraged him to consider problems and solutions without dampening his ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Despite these tendencies, he doesn't believe his university classmates or lecturers would have predicted his success as the CEO of AirTasker, partly due to his relaxed academic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Many initial reactions to AirTasker dismissed it as a "joke" or "hobby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## The Genesis and Development of AirTasker

The idea for AirTasker originated from a personal experience: Fung was moving apartments and asked a friend with a truck for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This led to a discussion with friends about why people rely on friends and family for such tasks when many others could earn a living doing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

The development of AirTasker took about eight months from initial concept to website and app launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Fung explains that what made him pursue this idea, unlike other ventures he explored (like interactive outdoor marketing), was his deep belief in AirTasker's value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. The concept of connecting someone needing work done with someone wanting to earn money was "synthesizable and understandable at a human level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This deep conviction was crucial for pushing through tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Scaling and Management

[[Duncan Andersons career journey from finance to edtech | Tim Fung]] emphasizes that the definition of "execution" changes significantly as a company scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Initially, it requires a combination of courage to put oneself out there and a touch of naivety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. The next phase involves developing specific skills like software engineering, marketing, or capital raising, or hiring those who possess them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

The most challenging shift is moving into a phase of empowering others, becoming less focused on being the "hero" who closes deals or executes campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. As CEO, the role transitions to creating a platform where others can achieve glory, which can be difficult for someone accustomed to direct action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

AirTasker, as a marketplace built on user-generated content, diverges from typical SaaS startup playbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. For a marketplace, scale *is* the product, akin to Facebook or the telephone, where connectivity is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. Early skills at AirTasker focused on experimentation and growth hacking, rather than just product and engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. Now, AirTasker is more product-centric, relying on data science and machine learning experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

Challenging moments have included dealing with capital raising, which he describes as one of the "most harrowing experiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. People issues, such as firing someone for the first time or conducting restructures, are also profoundly difficult and can keep him awake at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. Despite the challenges, he has never felt like quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

## Australian Startup Ecosystem

When AirTasker started in 2012, there was little to no startup ecosystem in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. There were no established VCs like Blackbird, Square Peg, or AirTree, nor well-known companies like Canva or SafetyCulture in their current form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. AirTasker even had to start its own co-working space due to the lack of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

Today, the ecosystem has significantly improved, with healthy angel, seed, and Series A funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. However, funding can still be limited if major VCs aren't interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. For companies like AirTasker, which started as an Australia-only model, raising money from the US was particularly difficult because American investors typically don't invest in products they cannot personally understand or use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. Fung believes the "micro is way more important than the macro," meaning that being the best startup in Sydney is more significant than needing to be in Silicon Valley if the product can thrive locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Advice

Fung employs strategies to manage stress, such as deliberately smiling when things get overwhelming, which his business coach noted as a "quirk" that helps shift his physical state away from fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

He recommends several books:
*   **"Change Your Questions, Change Your Life"**: Emphasizes approaching situations from a curious rather than judgmental position as a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.
*   **"Thinking in Bets" by Annie Duke**: Highlights the importance of dealing with ambiguity, particularly for leaders in startups, where precise forecasts might offer false security without operational impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>.
*   **"Thinking, Fast and Slow"**: Aligns with "The Inner Game of Tennis," focusing on acknowledging fast and slow thinking processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.

His most inspirational figure is Michael Schumacher, admired for his ability to build a caring and respected team while maintaining an incredibly high-performance bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.

For university students, Fung offers advice he received from an early investor: "Get ready to kiss a lot of frogs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. This prepares one for resilience, as roughly 95% of people will not support your ideas initially, and often they might be right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. The ability to handle rejection and "punch through it" is crucial for young people starting out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. This relates to the broader theme of [[proving_doubters_wrong_in_entrepreneurial_journey | proving doubters wrong]] in the [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_mindset | entrepreneurial journey]].

## Views on the Gig Economy and AirTasker's Model

Fung believes the "gig economy" umbrella term can be misleading, as it encompasses a wide range of work arrangements, similar to how "permanent full-time jobs" vary greatly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. He distinguishes between platforms that commoditize work and drive down labor costs (where price and work type are defined by the platform) and those like AirTasker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>.

AirTasker is an "infinitely horizontal marketplace" where the scope and price of work are defined by the community (the customer or the tasker), not the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. This makes AirTasker more akin to a platform like Google or a phone book, enabling connections rather than dictating terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. During the COVID-19 pandemic, AirTasker's horizontal nature allowed demand to seamlessly shift (e.g., cleaning dropped, but bicycle repairs and home office setups increased), demonstrating its malleability compared to verticalized platforms like Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.

On AirTasker, there is often a price premium, not a race to the bottom, with taskers able to charge more based on their profiles and reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. For example, in the past year, a top tasker earned $297,000 on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. This model prioritizes flexibility and allows individuals to monetize various skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.

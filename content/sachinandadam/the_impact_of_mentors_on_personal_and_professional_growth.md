Mentors play a pivotal role in shaping an individual's [[personal_and_professional_growth_through_coaching | personal and professional growth]], offering guidance, instilling discipline, and providing crucial insights that accelerate development and mitigate risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The speaker highlights that a strong mentorship relationship can be more impactful than formal education in certain contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>.

## Foundational Influence and Early Mentorship
The speaker credits early life experiences and guidance for instilling a strong work ethic and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Observing his mother build her company from scratch while raising him exposed him to "insane work ethic and focus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This informal, yet profound, [[impact_of_early_life_challenges_on_career_drive | influence]] shaped his approach to life and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

In high school, the speaker utilized tutors for various subjects, which he found helped him "get through things more efficiently" and instilled a necessary discipline, especially when facing laziness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This highlights the early recognition of structured guidance in boosting productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

## Strategic Guidance in Business Development
Mentors provided strategic direction, even for counter-intuitive decisions that proved highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. For instance, the idea for the speaker to attend business school, even during a critical expansion phase for Crimson, came from his mentor, Alex Robinson from Tiger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This "unusual strategy" in hindsight was "really effective" and compounded his [[personal_growth_and_selfawareness | learnings]] for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## The Significance of Deep Mentorship Bonds
The speaker emphasizes the quality over quantity in mentorship, valuing a deep connection with a few key individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>:

> "You don't want to have like a thousand people that don't care that much you want to have two people or even one person for which that bond is so deep they know you're really really well and I've been fortunate to have folks like that at each stage in the journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>

### Key Mentors and Their Contributions:

*   **Julian Robertson:** Described as the "most influential mentor," Julian Robertson, the founder of Tiger Management, profoundly influenced the speaker's understanding of [[the_role_of_values_and_self_reflection_in_personal_and_business_growth | leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. Robertson cultivated an "incredible hedge fund" and mentored a wave of analysts who went on to found major hedge funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. His leadership style focused on creating a "high integrity culture at scale" where individuals "do the right thing when no one's looking," balanced with a "high performance culture" that wasn't about "win at all costs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. Robertson also effectively leveraged his networks and prioritized family and [[importance_of_mentors_and_networks | mentorship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>.

*   **Jason Linger (Tiger Global):** Jason Linger served on Crimson's board for nearly seven years and played a crucial role in mentoring the founders from "clueless 20 year olds to less clueless 26y olds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>. He provided instrumental guidance through phases of international expansion, building technology teams, scaling the business, and improving unit economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.

*   **Sir John:** More recently, Sir John has been influential, particularly in the launch of Crimson's online high school in New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>.

## Broader Impact of Networks and Relationships
The discussion also touches upon the broader [[building_and_nurturing_personal_and_professional_relationships | impact of networks]], noting that elite universities offer a unique environment for finding co-founders and accessing venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. Being part of such a "Founder Community" speeds up success dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. This highlights how both formal and informal networks contribute to [[personal_and_professional_growth_through_coaching | personal and professional growth]].

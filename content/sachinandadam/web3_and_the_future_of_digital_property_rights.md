Robbie Ferguson, co-founder of Immutable X, highlights the transformative potential of [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_Web3 | Web3]] to fundamentally change the relationship between users and digital assets by enabling true digital property rights. Immutable X, valued at $2.5 billion, is a leading crypto gaming startup focused on this mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## The Problem with Web2: Lack of Ownership
In the current [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_Web3 | Web2]] landscape, gamers spend billions annually on digital items like skins and coins within games, yet they own none of these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. This means players cannot sell these items, and their value can be arbitrarily diminished or lost by game creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Examples of this exploitation include:
*   **Diablo (Blizzard)**: Blizzard shut down utility for players, leading to significant financial losses for those who had invested tens of thousands of dollars, causing them to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Counter-Strike GO**: Valve restricted trading, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in equity value being lost and a $300 million business (Opskins) going bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

Ferguson argues that just because something is intangible does not mean users shouldn't have property rights to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. The world is becoming increasingly digital, with people likely to spend most of their time in augmented or virtual reality in the future, making the extension of real-world custody rights to digital assets critically important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Web3's Solution: Enabling True Digital Ownership
Immutable X provides a platform for building [[realworld_applications_and_use_cases_of_Web3 | Web3 games]] where players can have actual property rights over their in-game items, allowing them to sell, own, and experience finite scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The platform uses a ZK roll-up scaling engine for NFTs and offers easy-to-use APIs to simplify development for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### Aligned Incentives and Value Creation
[[Decentralization_and_ownership_in_Web3 | Web3]] fundamentally changes the commercial incentives for game creators, driving business models towards appreciating the equity value of NFTs and giving players ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

*   **Magic the Gathering Arena Analogy**: If physical card game creators could take secondary market clips on trades, their business model would align with players, incentivizing them to grow the economy's value and create new contexts for assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **Profit Sharing**: Illuvium, a game built on Immutable X, directs 100% of its revenue from sales back to every token holder (ILE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. This "new model" allows users and creators to own 100% of profits, making the most successful games those that give the most back to players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
*   **Value for Players**: Players don't necessarily have to make money, but they gain value from playing the game instead of sinking thousands of dollars into assets with nothing to show for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **User Acquisition Tool**: Tokens serve as the "most powerful incentive and user acquisition tool ever generated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. By backing an economy with assets players can receive from playing and sharing, [[realworld_applications_and_use_cases_of_Web3 | Web3 games]] can increase viral coefficients and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

## Broader Implications of Digital Property Rights
The principle of digital property rights extends beyond gaming to:
*   Houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>
*   Intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>
*   Music rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>
*   Stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>

A major driving force for tokenization is the ability to tap into [[the_future_impact_of_blockchain_and_fintech_in_emerging_markets | Decentralized Finance (DeFi)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. This provides instantaneous and permissionless access to competitive financial services, increasing liquidity and utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

## Addressing Skepticism: "Why Web3 Won't Fail"
Despite market volatility and past scams, Ferguson maintains that [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_Web3 | Web3]]'s long-term inevitability is due to several factors:
*   **Cheaper Prices Always Win**: Tradable assets as NFTs offer a superior standard, driven by a "liquidity premium and a utility premium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   **Massive Capital and Talent Inflow**: Over $8.5 billion has been invested in [[realworld_applications_and_use_cases_of_Web3 | Web3 gaming]] in the last 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. The best talent from leading tech and gaming companies are also pouring into the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.
*   **The "Screenshot" Argument**: The idea that NFTs can simply be screenshotted is analogous to copying the Mona Lisa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. The value lies in provable ownership, status, and the ability to leverage intellectual property rights, as exemplified by projects like Board Apes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.

### User Experience and Abstraction
Current [[realworld_applications_and_use_cases_of_Web3 | Web3 game]] user experience for onboarding is "not great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. The goal is for games to have 100 million users, with only a small percentage even realizing they are using [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_Web3 | Web3]] technology under the surface, much like users don't understand how HTTPS or Unreal Engine works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. Companies like Aglet and VeVe are already abstracting away much of the [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_Web3 | Web3]] complexity for their millions of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

## The Future of the Digital World
Ferguson envisions a future where fees across digital platforms tend towards zero, and protocols allow everyone to be a part of it, akin to a "decentralized Uber" where participants own shares in the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. This vision for [[the_future_of_social_media_and_digital_interaction | digital interaction]] and [[the_future_of_work_and_remote_working | work]] aligns with concepts explored in science fiction, where society's backend operates like smart contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

This progress, combined with advancements in [[the_future_of_blockchain_and_its_potential_challenges | blockchain]] scaling (like Immutable X's cross-roll-up liquidity platform), aims to create unified, secure, and scalable digital ecosystems where users truly own their digital property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>.

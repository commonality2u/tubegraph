Two best friends, Sain and Adam, decided to quit their jobs and go "all in" on building their dream company, Kindling, despite not knowing exactly what they were doing at the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article details their [[transition_from_venture_capital_to_entrepreneurship | transition from venture capital to entrepreneurship]], the challenges they faced, their evolving vision, and the sacrifices made along their [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_mindset | entrepreneurial journey]].

## Pre-Entrepreneurship Careers and Podcast Origins

Adam previously worked in management consulting, while Sain worked in venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Their journey together began years earlier when they met on exchange in Utrecht, Netherlands, and became housemates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. They quickly became inseparable, sharing interests in gym, startups, and personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

Upon returning to Sydney, bored with their economics history lecturer, they decided to start a podcast to document their exchange experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Initially, the podcast was a natural outgrowth of their curiosity, featuring diverse guests like political activists, bodybuilders, and positive psychology experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. It served as a "vehicle to discover the world and be curious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

As their interests shifted towards technology, their content evolved, leading them to interview entrepreneurs like Tim Farm from AirTaska and Venture Capitalists such as Adam Ilgam (who later became an investor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. This focus on tech and venture capital became their niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. Sain eventually secured a role in venture capital at AirTree, while Adam continued in consulting before seeking a similar shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

Their immersion in the tech world included reading newsletters, listening to tech podcasts, and even starting a mini angel investing fund a few years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. Two years prior to this decision, they both envisioned themselves as venture capitalists for the next 10 to 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

## The Pivotal Decision: Full-Time Entrepreneurship

The idea of pursuing the podcast full-time emerged from a conversation in their shared house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. Initially, they considered it a "gap year" or "personal MBA," inspired by figures like Tim Ferris, who took a year off to angel invest and podcast for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.

However, Adam harbored hesitation, feeling he hadn't achieved enough in his career yet, especially amidst a tech crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>. He applied for VC roles and almost secured a "dream job," which, upon failing to get it, led to an "existential moment" and a rash decision to move to the States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>. This period highlighted multiple instances where their paths could have diverged, with Sain considering moving to New York and Adam to the US or London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>.

Applying the "regret minimization framework," they realized that at age 25, this was likely their last opportunity to go "all in" on a venture together, living in the same place and potentially with their parents to reduce costs, before significant life changes like marriage or children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>. Adam still struggled with an insecurity, feeling he hadn't "done enough" in his career to take a year off for podcasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>. This difference in perspective created tension, as Sain, having more work experience, felt more "de-risked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>.

### The Moment of Clarity

The pivotal shift occurred during Adam's 30-minute walk to his Deloitte office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>. He realized they didn't just have to start a podcast; they could build something worth over $100 million and impact millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>. This "Moment of Clarity" led to a vision of creating a major tech media company for Australia and Asia Pacific, recruiting others, launching new shows (e.g., in edtech), and building customer intelligence platforms from media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>. This marked the transformation from a podcast idea to a "very, very serious startup endeavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Obstacles and Mindset Shift

Sain admits that his [[impact_of_personal_experiences_on_entrepreneurship | personal experiences]] of observing founders in his VC role, seeing them mortgage homes and lose relationships, made him fearful of starting something himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>. Both also had an artificial constraint in their minds: thinking they had to bootstrap the venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>. They didn't even give themselves permission to discuss funding or bigger ideas until Adam's moment of clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>.

Adam's previous investor mindset had limited his thinking to businesses that could yield significant returns for a large fund, often equating success with multi-billion dollar Enterprise SaaS companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>. By taking off that "hat," he realized that building value for 100 million people could lead to monetization, even without fitting the traditional VC-backed SaaS model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. They started to think "in an unconstrained way," leading to the realization that this was their "dream life, the dream company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:00">[20:43:00]</a>.

The shift was rapid and felt "locked in" immediately after the big idea emerged in late August/early September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>. They describe a "spiritual" feeling of alignment, where even in the worst-case scenario, the experience would be "incredible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a>.

## Kindling: The Dream Company

Kindling aims to be APAC's premier Tech Media company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>. Under the Kindling umbrella, they plan to create and partner for the best tech media content globally, including podcasts, newsletters, and TikToks, focusing on the APAC and India regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:28:00">[29:28:00]</a>.

Their broader vision extends beyond just media, leveraging "eyeballs, information, data, and insights" gathered from media to build other ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>. They are particularly passionate about the EdTech space and customer intelligence platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:36:00">[30:36:00]</a>. This represents a "distribution-first" model, similar to creators like Logan Paul (Prime) and Mr. Beast (chocolate brand), where a strong media presence provides a launchpad for other businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>.

They believe in the growing "parasocial relationship" between creators and their audience, arguing that these connections will increasingly outweigh traditional media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:33:00">[31:33:00]</a>. The acceleration of AI tools making software development easier further emphasizes the importance of distribution and these creator-audience relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:22:00">[32:22:00]</a>. The timing for this venture feels fortunate, as similar models are only just emerging and gaining traction in the US, evidenced by parallels with companies like Colossus and Eric Turpenburg's Turpentine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:36:00">[32:36:00]</a>.

## Sacrifices and Future Outlook

The [[personal_experiences_and_goals_in_entrepreneurship | entrepreneurial journey]] has already required significant sacrifices, including drastically cut pay, moving back home with parents, reducing alcohol consumption, and a focused life centered on work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:04:00">[28:04:00]</a>. Despite these challenges, they feel the decision is "right," highlighting the intrinsic motivation that comes from being truly aligned with their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:30:00">[28:30:00]</a>.

They are aware of the responsibilities that come with taking on investor money, balancing rigor and their grand vision with the love for what they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:37:00">[28:37:00]</a>. This is a long-term commitment, explicitly signing up for "10 plus years" of this work, viewing it as a "life's work situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:33:00">[35:33:00]</a>. Their "building public" series aims to provide a raw, vulnerable, behind-the-scenes look at their journey, hoping to offer learning and inspiration for others navigating their own paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:18:00">[34:18:00]</a>.

Liam Milwood, the founder of Instant, a company valued at $100 million, identifies a core motivation behind his rapid [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_mindset | entrepreneurial journey]] and success: proving doubters wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39"></a>.

### The Drive to Prove Wrong

Milwood's drive is fueled by a desire to overcome skepticism from various sources:
*   **Disrespectful hires** Individuals on the team who showed "absolutely no respect for the company that we've already built" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41"></a>, and who had "no impact" on where Instant was headed, motivated Milwood to prove them wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02"></a>.
*   **Skeptical investors** Investors told Milwood that Instant was "just going to be a little side hustle that would crash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49"></a>. Whether they were prominent Silicon Valley investors or unknown Australian figures, their rejections were a constant source of motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13"></a>.
*   **Program rejections** Instant was "absolutely rejected" from programs like Startmate by "very experienced business people" who claimed it wasn't Milwood's "life's work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30"></a>. This rejection fueled his determination.
*   **Competitor concerns** Early in Instant's journey, potential investors cited large competitors like Fast and Bolt as reasons not to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49"></a>. The fact that these competitors later went out of business validated Milwood's path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58"></a>.
*   **Youthful skepticism** Milwood was 17 when he raised his first funding round, and his mother was still the company's director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02"></a>. This youthful start, coupled with the need to prove himself, was a significant driver.

### The Complementary Drive: Proving People Right

Beyond proving doubters wrong, Milwood is also motivated by a desire to validate the belief of those who supported him:
*   **Family support** His parents contributed a "little bit of money" in the first angel round, and Milwood aimed to make them a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10"></a>.
*   **Employee wealth creation** A key goal is to make early employees, and those joining today, wealthy for their efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27"></a>.
*   **Early supporters** Rewarding early angel investors and customers is also a significant motivator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33"></a>.
*   **Shared legacy** Milwood wants people to have a story in five or ten years about their incredible work at the "fastest growing company in Australia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39"></a>.

### Sources of this Drive

Milwood attributes his intense drive to several factors:
*   **Childhood experiences** Growing up with middle-class police officer parents who were not in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39"></a>, moving around frequently, and traveling for four years meant he couldn't get a traditional job like at McDonald's, leading him to start his first business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50"></a>.
*   **Consistent rejection** Milwood highlights "the constant rejection" he faced when he was younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09"></a>. This includes being rejected from university initially, despite having already built a successful magazine business with 50,000 readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13"></a>.
*   **Competitive background** He was a "very competitive swimmer in high school" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38"></a>.
*   **Goal-oriented mindset** He has "always just been very driven towards a goal" and "don't stop until I get that goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43"></a>.

### Impact on Leadership and Company Culture

Milwood's drive manifests in his leadership style and the culture at Instant:
*   **Aggressive goal setting** Instant's primary goals are aggressive revenue targets, aiming for 25% month-on-month growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24"></a>, and a billion-dollar valuation in the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54"></a>. This commitment to being the "best, fastest growing company in Australia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00"></a> is shared across the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07"></a>.
*   **"Naivety" as an advantage** Milwood views his "naivity" as a "biggest secret" because he lacks past experiences from traditional, slower workplaces. This allows Instant to "inflict this energy into people" to quickly achieve goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14"></a>.
*   **Positive culture** Despite the intensity, Milwood prioritizes a positive culture, believing leaders "get way more out of people" by leading with positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37"></a>. He aims for a culture where people feel supported, get both positive and negative feedback, and grow personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04"></a>.
*   **Relentless pursuit of momentum** Milwood firmly believes that "momentum solves every issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06"></a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20"></a>. This means driving speed and urgency throughout the business, making rapid decisions, and consistently prioritizing growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57"></a>. He views people with momentum as "hamsters" constantly running to maintain that energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05"></a>.
*   **Focus on revenue and speed** Instant's core values are "revenue obsession and speed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15"></a>, with every decision and product development laddering up to revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14"></a>.

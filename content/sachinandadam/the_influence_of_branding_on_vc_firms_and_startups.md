Jessie Wu, an up-and-coming venture capitalist (VC) in Australia, discusses the critical role of branding for both individuals and firms in the startup ecosystem. Her insights highlight how a distinct brand, whether personal or corporate, can drive influence, differentiate, and attract necessary capital. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

## Personal Branding in Venture Capital

Jessie Wu has cultivated a strong personal brand, particularly visible through her presence on platforms like LinkedIn and her active engagement in media. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> She is known for being vocal and bold, often challenging existing hierarchies and calling out opinions in public forums. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>

Her approach to public engagement is guided by a philosophy she calls "punching up," or a "tug of war rope" analogy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a> She believes in engaging when there is "enough tension in that rope," meaning when the other party holds a significant amount of power or influence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>

> "Somebody who has power might have the ability to have a lot of influence on the people around them or indeed society at large, through merely the things they say in terms of that shaping norms within an organization within a broader culture in which they have influenced. So certainly a Founder, a CEO has power, a partner at a VC fund might have power, the media has power. And so that means that when they say something, they are providing tension at the end of the rope and I think it's productive to then tug on the other end of the rope." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>

As her own influence has grown, she has become more considered and calculated in the discussions she enters, recognizing the discursive power she now wields. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>

## Branding for Startups and VC Firms

Jessie Wu applies a similar branding philosophy to VC firms, emphasizing the concept of "resonance." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a> This idea, borrowed from physics, suggests that if two things vibrate at the same frequency, they will create a sound or "resonate." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>

For a brand, this means tuning into one's "own frequency" and trusting that those who are attuned to that same frequency will connect with it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a> This involves finding one's authentic voice, especially in writing or speaking, where ideas flow naturally rather than feeling "cobbled together" or "phony." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> A key aspect of this is respecting the audience's intelligence and not "bullshitting them." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>

### After Work's Branding Strategy

After Work, the community-powered fund where Jessie Wu is a partner, exemplifies this branding approach. Launched in March 2021, After Work differentiated itself as a "Motley Crew of about 25 people" who collaborated on startup opportunities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>

Their branding highlights:
*   **Unique and Edgy Style**: After Work has a "slightly edgy, really modern branding." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>
*   **Differentiation for Upstarts**: For new or different entities, branding is crucial for differentiation, whereas established firms with strong networks may rely less on it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>
*   **Community-Powered Model**: After Work's core value proposition is its community of 120 people, providing a network of support and expertise to portfolio companies beyond just capital. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a> This model allows them to make smaller initial checks to build relationships and gather deep, long-term conviction before making larger follow-on investments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>

This "community" provides a [[cultural_influences_on_branding | competitive advantage]] for After Work, allowing them to tap into subject matter expertise from diverse backgrounds and cut through industry "noise and System 1 thinking." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>

## The Role of Storytelling in Funding and Success

[[the_role_of_storytelling_in_venture_capital_and_startup_success | Storytelling]] is widely acknowledged as a vital skill for founders. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a> It aids in:
*   **Fundraising**: Captivating investors and securing capital. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>
*   **Hiring**: Attracting top talent to the team. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>
*   **Selling**: Persuading customers and partners. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>
*   **Motivating Teams**: Inspiring employees with a shared purpose and vision. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>

However, Jessie Wu cautions against over-reliance on a founder's story, especially in early-stage [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | venture capital]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>

> "Over indexing on how a Founder's story makes you feel, especially in that first meeting, can be giving in to what Daniel Kahneman on thinking fast and slow calls systems one thinking, which is being very guided by your intuition, your emotional response, which is clouded by particularities of of your past and experiences that you've had." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>

She highlights that stories can "gloss over gaping plot holes," "misdirect," and create an "inevitability" that isn't certain. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a> It's crucial for investors to ask difficult questions about unit economics and value creation, even if it feels like being a "Debbie Downer." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a> For pre-seed investments, it's possible to test the coherence of a founder's thinking, such as their understanding of profitability at a unit level. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>

## Broader Ecosystem Influence of Branding

Large VC funds also leverage their brand to influence the broader Australian tech ecosystem. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a> Funds like Blackbird, for example, act as "market makers for big ambition" by signaling a "huge pot of money that's available to people who have sufficiently big ambition." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>

Through events like Sunrise and promoting the idea of Australia as a "creative nation," these funds use their brand and [[the_role_of_media_in_venture_capital | media]] presence to encourage talented individuals to build their careers and companies locally, ensuring a continuous supply of promising startups for future investments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a> This proactive stance aims to create an ecosystem that supports the deployment of large funds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>

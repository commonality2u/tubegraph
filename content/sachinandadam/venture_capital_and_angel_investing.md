From: [[sachinandadam]] <br/> 

The hosts, Sachin and Adam, interview leaders globally to unpack their failures, successes, and passionate ideas, believing that significant life learnings come from open and personal conversations rather than textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Impact of Lockdown and New Projects

During a lockdown in Sydney, the hosts recognized a surge of interest in [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | venture capital]], startups, and tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This environment spurred them to undertake new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. A notable project includes collaborating with "Textbook Ventures" and a friend to write a booklet covering entrepreneurship, [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | venture capital]], and [[investing_in_startups_and_earlystage_companies | angel investing]] for university students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This booklet aims to democratize access to information about these industries, especially in Australia, where the tech scene is growing but often insular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### The Australian Tech and VC Scene

The Australian tech and [[navigating_venture_capital_and_startup_ecosystems | VC scene]] has experienced significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Recent developments include:
*   The formation of the Tech Council of Australia, a lobbying organization headed by Robyn Denholm (Chair of Tesla) and including figures like Nick Molnar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   Afterpay, Nick Molnar's company, was acquired by Square, marking a landmark event for the Australian technology ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This acquisition is expected to result in significant angel investing and have a trickle-down effect on the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   Large funds like Tiger are increasingly investing in Australia at later stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | Venture capital]] in Australia is a "hot" market, with companies raising at high valuations in seed rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   Australia has seen a significant increase in "unicorns" (startups valued over $1 billion), with funding levels in June and July nearly matching all of 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Passion for Technology and Impact Investing

The hosts' interest in technology stems from its role as one of society's "greatest equalizing forces" and a driver of global progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. They view technology as a vehicle to achieve their obsession with "shifting the world forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. They are passionate about creating impact through business and believe that investing in early-stage companies allows them to genuinely influence the direction of influential companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This aligns with their goal to push forward the idea of "equality of opportunity" through [[social_venture_capital_and_impact_investing | social venture capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

They plan to delve deep into specific technology areas like biotech and edtech, driven by a growth mindset that believes these areas are learnable despite lacking traditional science backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Learning Methodologies

During lockdown, the hosts learned about [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | venture capital]] and startups through various means:
*   **Online Communities**: Participating in Discord and Slack channels where entrepreneurs, investors, and university students discuss ideas, pitch startups, and analyze economic trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Content Consumption**: Listening to podcasts and reading online articles and blogs, particularly on platforms like Substack, which are decentralizing media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

## The Sachin Adam Show's Mission

The podcast has redefined its mission to be "the home for future business leaders who want to use their skills and capital to make change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. This overarching theme focuses on learning from inspirational people and using business for good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

Their "life work" is structured around three aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>:
1.  **Business (Investing)**: Actively engaging in [[investing_in_startups_and_earlystage_companies | angel investing]] with friends and forming a formal syndicate to approach startups, providing both capital and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The long-term goal is to manage a larger fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
2.  **Education (Podcast)**: Learning from experts and sharing those insights with others to promote self-improvement and using business for greater impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
3.  **Media**: Creating content across various platforms like TikTok and Twitter to broaden their reach and share articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

## Why Venture Capital Over Entrepreneurship

Sachin expresses a preference for [[venture_capital_perspectives_and_founderfirst_investing | venture capital]] over being a singular entrepreneur because of its "macro" impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. As a generalist, he wouldn't be satisfied solving just one problem for his entire life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | VC]] allows for investment across different themes and engagement with diverse entrepreneurs and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. The role of a VC often involves constant engagement with new ideas and people across various economic sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. This preference was solidified after an interview with Adam Milgram from Giant Leap Fund, whose daily life resonated with their aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

It's noted that [[venture_capital_perspectives_and_founderfirst_investing | VC]] and entrepreneurship are not mutually exclusive, as some large funds (e.g., Lux Capital, Social Capital, Chamath Palihapitiya's fund, David Sacks' fund) also initiate companies under their brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## Building in Public

The hosts embrace the strategy of "building in public," sharing their work and thought processes transparently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. They believe this approach, while inviting mistakes, fosters learning and allows for feedback and challenges to their thinking and biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. This public approach aims to generate conversation and allows for stress-testing their investment theses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.

## Case Study: Azak (Ugandan Fintech)

Azak represents the type of investment that particularly excites the hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. It was their first angel investment made with a close friend, Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

### The Problem Azak Solves
Azak is a Ugandan-based fintech company with the ambition to build the first full-stack digital bank for Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. It addresses a critical "capital gap" in the developing world where traditional financial institutions avoid lending to poorer individuals due to a lack of documentation and creditworthiness information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. This information asymmetry leads to moral hazard, pushing people towards loan sharks with exorbitant interest rates (e.g., 50%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. Access to initial capital is crucial for individuals to break out of poverty cycles, enabling them to buy motorbikes for income or land for farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.

### Azak's Solution
Azak started by providing loans to motorcycle drivers (bobber drivers) in Uganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. It innovatively uses mobile phone data from these drivers to quantify their ability to repay loans, achieving a 96% repayment rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. The company's strategy involves:
1.  **Starting with low-hanging fruit**: Lending for motorcycle loans and mobile phone plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.
2.  **Data-driven iteration**: Using accumulated data points to predict future loan repayment capabilities, allowing for larger loan sizes and expansion into new markets and verticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.

### Broader Impact and "Leapfrogging"
Azak is part of a broader "thematic" of fintechs in Africa that are "leapfrogging" traditional financial development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. Instead of a linear progression from cash to physical banks to credit cards, African nations are moving directly from cash-based economies to digital payments via mobile phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. This phenomenon was previously observed in China, where the economy shifted from mostly cash in 2010 to over 85% QR code payments by 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.

Other examples of this trend include:
*   **LeapFrog**: A private equity fund that used mobile phone data to inform insurance decisions in Africa, leading to 500,000-600,000 more people insured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. This highlights the collision between technology advancements and the reshaping of traditional business models in banking and insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.
*   **Payswitch and Flutterwave**: Companies creating payment APIs for cross-border remittances in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>.

This accelerated growth curve in Africa, driven by efficient technologies, is expected to lay the foundation for future commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. The continent's young and growing population makes it an exciting economy for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy: Profit with Purpose

The hosts' investment philosophy focuses on companies that can achieve both tangible social impact and massive financial profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. This "profit with purpose" model, exemplified by LeapFrog, is central to their [[challenges_and_strategies_in_venture_investing | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.

They plan to release their writings and investment memos, such as the Azak memo, to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. These documents will detail their process for assessing founders, markets, and financial modeling, aiming to allow others to learn from and stress-test their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.

## The Future of Communities and Education

Online communities, particularly those structured with accountability and diverse perspectives, are becoming a dominant learning methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. These communities, often on platforms like Slack, allow individuals to share work, debate ideas, and engage in intense discussions that defend core assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.

They address two main problems with traditional edtech:
1.  **Accountability**: While vast amounts of free online content exist, communities provide the structure and accountability necessary to finish courses, take notes, and review material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.
2.  **Status Signals**: The challenge for these emerging community-based learning models is to establish "status signals" comparable to traditional university degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. The hosts hope that in the future, active engagement and high participation rates within these communities will become as strong a signal as a university degree, often at a much lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.

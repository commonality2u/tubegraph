Solving the world's meat consumption crisis doesn't require giving up meat entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. An Australian startup, Vow, is addressing this by diversifying the human diet with cultured meat, avoiding factory farming and habitat destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

The global demand for meat continues to rise annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Animal agriculture is frequently cited as one of the top contributors to CO2 emissions, accounting for nearly 60% of all greenhouse gases according to Guardian headlines, and livestock production is responsible for about 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions—more than cars, planes, and all other forms of transport combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The existing food system cannot meet the projected human demand for meat over the next 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Limitations of Plant-Based Alternatives

Plant-based meat brands have struggled to break through because they attempt to imitate existing products and have "failed miserably" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Meat eaters generally lack interest in these products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. At best, plant-based alternatives might convince vegetarians and vegans to try something new, but they do not typically alter the eating habits of carnivores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Many companies in the alternative protein sector initially targeted low-price, highly commoditized products like beef burgers, believing there was a vast market to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. However, this strategy faltered as brands like Beyond Meat and Impossible experienced difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

## The Cultured Meat Approach

Vow's "contrarian bet" aims to fulfill growing meat demand while benefiting the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Unlike plant-based options, Vow isn't merely recreating existing products; they are innovating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

> "There's this existential challenge for us in terms of the environment and people want to eat and eat, so why not just make a better version of it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>

### What is Cultured Meat?
Cultured or cultivated meat is animal meat produced from animal cells without requiring the animal to be killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. What people eat as meat—muscle, fat, and connective tissue—is grown outside the animal by taking cells that repair those tissues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

The process is compared to growing a plant:
1.  **Seeds**: Cells are taken from an animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
2.  **Soil**: Cells are grown in a "media" (juice) – a mixture of vitamins and minerals that recreates bodily conditions for effective cell growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
3.  **Growing Conditions**: Cells are prepped, placed in the media, and piped into bioreactors, replicating the ideal conditions for cell growth found in animal bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Vow's Differentiators
[[vows_approach_to_cultured_meat_and_its_innovation_in_the_food_industry | Vow's approach to cultured meat and its innovation in the food industry]] distinguishes itself in two main ways:
1.  **Cost Efficiency**: The cost of Vow's facility is a fraction of other cultured meat facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. They have developed the world's most efficient bioreactor, breaking a Guinness World Record by producing 20,000 L of cell culture in one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. They eliminated 45% of the cost compared to similar systems by removing unnecessary complexity and redesigning their process from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. This allows them to produce three times as much cell mass with their new process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
2.  **Product Innovation**: Vow focuses on creating entirely unique products with new textures, tastes, and from new animals, rather than just competing with traditional meats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. There are 8,000 species of mammals and 11,000 species of birds available for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This provides a unique market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

> "The future of meat will be a kaleidoscope of choice with many options for each of us to pick from selfishly because they're more delicious and more desirable than eating animals." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

### Go-to-Market Strategy
[[market_strategies_and_consumer_perception_of_cultured_meat_products | Vow's market strategies and consumer perception of cultured meat products]] aims to overcome consumer perception [[challenges_and_advancements_in_cultured_meat_technology | challenges and advancements in cultured meat technology]]. There's a misconception that cultured meat is similar to plant-based products, which are made of plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Vow emphasizes that their product is real meat, genetically identical to animal cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

Vow believes that starting with high-end luxury products and gradually moving downmarket, similar to Tesla's strategy, is more likely to create widespread consumer behavior change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Their first brand, Forge, is a luxury brand currently available in Singapore and soon to launch in other jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. It is sold in high-end restaurants and moving into higher-end casual dining spaces to create a positive influence and halo effect, ultimately allowing them to move into supermarkets with a positive perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### The Future of Cultured Meat
Vow aims to create "no compromise" meat that is tasty, nutritious, affordable, and sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. In 10 to 20 years, people may buy cultured meat that tastes like Wagyu beef, has the nutritional profile of salmon with omega-3s and iron, is rich in protein, lasts weeks in the fridge, is easy to cook, and has a tiny [[environmental_impact_of_traditional_meat_production | environmental impact of traditional meat production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. This long-term vision aims to supplement and augment the current food system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

Ben Thompson, founder of the unicorn company Employment Hero, shares insights into [[remote_work_and_its_impact_on_company_culture_and_productivity | the future of work]], drawing from his extensive experience in business and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Thompson, who works [[remote_work_and_its_impact_on_company_culture_and_productivity | remotely]] full-time since 2020, views his business as a hobby and enjoys building things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. He has a passion for technology, from early digital watches to current AI advancements like DALL-E, which he sees as a common thread throughout his diverse career in economics, law, and tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## The Persistence of Remote Work
Thompson asserts that the traditional office environment will not return to its pre-pandemic state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. Employment Hero surveys conducted in 2020 and 2021 across Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, and the UK revealed overwhelming employee expectations for [[remote_work_and_its_impact_on_company_culture_and_productivity | remote work]]:
*   In 2020, 92% of employees expected to work [[remote_work_and_its_impact_on_company_culture_and_productivity | remotely]] at least one day a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.
*   This figure increased to 94% in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.
Thompson highlights the extraordinary consensus on this issue, stating that such high agreement is rare for any subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

## Advantages of Remote Work
Thompson outlines several compelling reasons why [[remote_work_and_its_impact_on_company_culture_and_productivity | remote work]] is superior:

### Expanded Talent Pool
Businesses that mandate five days in the office restrict their talent pool to a small geographic radius, such as 30 kilometers from the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. For example, the working population of Sydney is 2 million, but the number of full-stack developers within a 30km radius is only a few thousand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>. By embracing [[remote_work_and_its_impact_on_company_culture_and_productivity | remote work]], companies can access a global talent pool of billions, making it illogical to limit recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

### Social and Moral Benefits
[[remote_work_and_its_impact_on_company_culture_and_productivity | Remote work]] offers significant social and moral advantages:
*   **Work-life balance for parents:** It enables working parents to juggle life and childcare responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Thompson himself relies on [[remote_work_and_its_impact_on_company_culture_and_productivity | remote work]] to care for his youngest son, who has special needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   **Rural opportunities:** People choosing or born in rural and remote areas can participate in the global economy. As an example, Thompson's Chief of Staff, a lawyer and economist, lives on a cattle station near Moree and works online, earning good money that can be spent in her local community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

### Global Connectivity and Poverty Alleviation
The [[future_of_jobs_and_skills_in_an_aidriven_world | future of work]] will be profoundly shaped by global internet access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. Currently, 34% of the world's population (3 billion people) have never been online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. Projects like Starlink and those by Bezos are set to bring global internet access within the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. This will allow billions of people currently living in poverty to enter the [[future_of_jobs_and_skills_in_an_aidriven_world | global online economy]], enabling them to contribute in unprecedented ways and potentially lifting them out of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

### Critique of Traditional Office Work
Thompson likens a human skyscraper, where people commute and sit in air-conditioned offices under fluorescent lights to "pump out work," to a chicken coop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. He argues that [[remote_work_and_its_impact_on_company_culture_and_productivity | remote work]] is healthier and more balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

## Challenges and Solutions for Remote Work
While a strong advocate for [[remote_work_and_its_impact_on_company_culture_and_productivity | remote work]], Thompson acknowledges challenges, particularly for early-career professionals:
*   **Learning and Development:** The learning rate for young talent often increases rapidly in an office setting due to easy access to managers for quick explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.
*   **Social Element:** The social aspect of work, including meeting partners and colleagues, is an important part of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

### Hybrid Work and Innovation
Thompson advocates for a hybrid model where individuals work [[remote_work_and_its_impact_on_company_culture_and_productivity | remotely]] when it makes sense and gather when it's beneficial for learning and social cohesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. He believes a good manager will facilitate these gatherings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. He emphasizes that the world is not returning to a 9-to-5, five-days-a-week office model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>.

He also proposes a startup idea for a "Remote Social" network to connect [[remote_work_and_its_impact_on_company_culture_and_productivity | remote employees]] within geographic boundaries for social interaction, potentially leveraging venues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

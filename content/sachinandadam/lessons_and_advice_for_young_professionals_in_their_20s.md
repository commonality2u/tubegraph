Nikki Ševak, co-founder of Blackbird Ventures and Startmate, offers profound [[advice_for_young_people_and_career_choices | advice for young people]] in their 20s, particularly concerning career choices and [[learning_and_career_development_in_startup_environments | learning and career development]]. His insights, drawn from personal experience and observation of successful entrepreneurs, challenge traditional career paths and emphasize the importance of prioritizing rapid learning and calculated risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Prioritizing the Rate of Learning

Ševak advises young professionals to prioritize environments that offer the highest rate of learning, rather than focusing on immediate salary or prestige <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. He highlights that a young person's "burn rate" (personal expenses) is typically at its lowest in their early 20s, providing ultimate flexibility to take risks without being locked into a life requiring a high salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

> "The gift that you've been given at 23 is that you haven't ramped up your burn rate, you don't pay childcare or mortgage... you have the ultimate flexibility because hopefully your personal burn rate is at the best it's ever ever gonna look in life so now is now is the time to take that risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

## The Value of Startup Experience

Traditional graduate jobs or programs are critiqued for their inherently slow rate of learning, often "drip-fed" to retain employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. In contrast, startup environments offer a "turbo-filled knowledge journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

### Founding a Startup

Ševak shares his own experience of dropping out of university (to go part-time) to start a company, stating he learned more in 12-24 months of that journey than in his entire university degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. He notes that while founding a company offers tremendous learning, the "zero to one" stage is a process of discovery, and often the startup doesn't work out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

### Joining a Scaling Startup

Ševak posits that an even higher rate of learning can be achieved by joining a *scaling* startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. He recommends joining companies post-Series A funding, typically with 20-50 employees, and rapidly expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. In such environments:
*   **Rapid Learning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>: You gain exposure to diverse aspects of business (market, customers, marketing, sales, internal organization, communication) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Career Progression** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>: As a company grows from 20 to 200 employees, 180 new roles are created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. By demonstrating talent and building trust with the senior team, young employees can be "super promoted" into senior leadership roles that might otherwise take decades in traditional firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This contrasts sharply with industries like law, where rungs are constantly added to the ladder, slowing down career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

## Reframing Risk

People often overestimate the risk of joining a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Even if a startup fails, the experience gained, the lessons learned, and the network built make an individual "so much more attractive to be hired" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

> "People think they're taking risks but they're really not like again if you do a startup and fail you will have learnt so much such that that will make you so much more attractive to be hired... that will lead to so much serendipity in terms of people you meet and and a network of people which you'll have for life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

The "expected value" of joining a Series A startup, from both a [[learning_and_career_development_in_startup_environments | learning and wealth perspective]], is likely higher than entering stereotypical industries like consulting or banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

## Recommended Scaling Companies for Young Australians

Ševak identifies several rapidly scaling Australian companies that offer significant [[learning_and_career_development_in_startup_environments | learning and career development]] opportunities for young professionals, with a bias towards Blackbird's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>:

*   **Sydney:**
    *   Eucalyptus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a> (over 200 employees, rapidly scaled from under 40 in 12-18 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
    *   Dovetail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a> (around 60 employees, rapidly expanding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
*   **Melbourne:**
    *   Linktree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>
    *   Zeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>

These companies are characterized by their rapid customer growth, which necessitates the organization to catch up, providing immense [[lessons_from_scaling_and_entrepreneurship | scaling]] and learning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>. He suggests that the ideal company size to join for general business roles is between 20 and 200 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>, ensuring the company is post-traction, and not limited to only technical or product roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

## The Role of Community in Career Growth

Blackbird and Startmate's philosophy emphasizes the importance of community in the startup ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. Helping someone with their career creates a powerful "flywheel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. Programs like the Startmate fellowship focus on enhancing careers, connecting individuals with startups, and helping them calibrate where and when to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. This approach aims to nurture the next generation of founders, as many start their careers in fast-growing startup environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>.

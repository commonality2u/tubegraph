The world is expected to change dramatically over the next 5 to 10 years due to the rapid advancement of technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. This shift will have profound [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society | implications for society]] and the workforce, creating both challenges and new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

## AI's Influence on Industries and Employment

The consensus is that the gap between job losses and new jobs created by AI will be too quick to effectively solve, potentially leading to a significant time gap in employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. This creates a potential economic, political, and social crisis due to the [[impact_of_ai_on_employment_and_the_future_of_work | diminishing jobs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>.

Technology, particularly AI, is seen as a scaling variable for GDP, increasing its potential over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:24">[00:59:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>. However, the traditional software model of selling to large service businesses or tech companies is changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.

New opportunities are emerging in:
*   **Deep Tech**: Like companies such as Palantir, Snowflake, and AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>.
*   **AI-Enabled Services**: Where the cost of building software goes down, making AI-enabled services a viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. This means businesses with human capital as their main cost center can see costs come down while revenue remains stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.
*   **Talent Spotting**: AI will increase returns to talent spotting, as one person using many tools well can achieve 10-20x leverage compared to hiring many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:23">[00:49:23]</a>.

### Choosing Future Industries

When considering future ventures, it's important to identify industries that cannot be affected by AI in the next 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:23">[00:45:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. This leads to a focus on industries that are "unsexy" or have not had much innovation or competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.

Frank Grief suggests:
*   **Construction**: Areas like home renovation are unlikely to be fully replaced by robots, as hands will likely remain more cost-effective for high-value projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>. Even in competitive, low-margin sectors, smart business practices and focusing on specific categories can yield success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>.
*   **Underserved Service Businesses**: Many service businesses haven't seen much "love" or innovation, making them attractive for new competitors who bring proper business thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.

Others suggest:
*   **Private Equity in "Mom and Pop" Shops**: Buying up smaller businesses that might struggle with the AI wave and integrating technology into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>.
*   **Unsexy but Essential Niches**: Industries like garbage collection or even highly specific manufacturing components (e.g., car door locking systems) can be incredibly lucrative if operated efficiently and with high market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.
*   **Multiples Arbitrage**: A strategy in private equity involving buying a collection of small, individual businesses in an "unsexy" industry (e.g., tattoo removal) at a low multiple and then selling the consolidated entity at a higher multiple due to reduced risk and centralized support functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Mindset in a Changing Landscape

Successful entrepreneurs are characterized by:
*   **Drive and Creative Thinking**: As exemplified by Frank Grief's journey from chef to real estate tech mogul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.
*   **Intentionality and Structure**: Learning what is needed to be the best version of oneself, and living a disciplined life that supports business goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   **"High Agency"**: A willingness to act quickly and get things done, rather than overthinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.
*   **The Compound Effect of Quick Decisions**: Compressing the time from decision-making to execution leads to a significant long-term compound effect on success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
*   **Iteration and Testing**: Instead of rigid five-year plans, continuously test decisions, learn from results, and be prepared to tweak, change, or abandon ideas quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Comfort with Uncertainty**: The process of "getting started" makes one more comfortable with uncertainty, as adapting quickly to challenges becomes second nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
*   **Identifying "Unfair Advantages"**: Leveraging unique aspects, such as youth, can be a superpower in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Earning Money Early**: In the early stages of a business, the primary focus should be on generating revenue, as "revenue solves a lot of problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>.

Frank Grief's personal experience of growing up in poverty instilled a strong drive for commercial and monetary success, which he views as a scorekeeper in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. However, beyond initial financial security, the motivation shifts towards fulfillment, purpose, and the excitement of building and making an [[artificial_intelligence_and_workforce_transformation | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. This includes incorporating impact into the business supply chain, such as employing people with disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to build something great with a positive impact, recognizing that true meaning often comes from relationships, family, and contributing to [[the_impact_of_agi_on_industries_and_the_role_of_people | cultural change]] through technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. The [[the_future_of_technology_and_innovation_in_australia | future of technology and innovation in Australia]] is seen as a way to solve global problems and shift the nation's economic focus from traditional industries like finance and mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.

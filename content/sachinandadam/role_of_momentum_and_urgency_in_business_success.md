In the fast-paced world of startups, **momentum** and **urgency** are not just buzzwords but critical drivers of success. Liam Millwood, founder of Instant, a company valued at $100 million just four years after its inception, emphasizes that these two factors are paramount to a company's growth and ability to overcome challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### The Power of Momentum

Momentum is described as the solution to every issue within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. When a business gains momentum, it energizes the team, excites investors, and encourages customers, leading to the creation of new products and continued growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This concept is a core value at Instant, alongside speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

Millwood explains that a company's velocity, or speed of movement, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Once velocity slows down, it becomes incredibly difficult to regain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Therefore, maintaining momentum should be a constant focus, superseding investments in other areas like culture or product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

### Instilling Urgency

For Instant, infusing urgency throughout the organization is key. This is achieved through:

*   **Obsession with Revenue** The company established a single "northstar" goal: reaching a million dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. This clear and singular focus aligned everyone, from the CEO to engineers, on a common objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.
*   **Rapid Execution and Weekly Sprints** To maintain urgency, Instant operates on a week-by-week basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Instead of monthly or bi-weekly meetings and sprints, everything is reviewed and prioritized weekly. This ensures continuous [[prioritization_and_focus_in_business | prioritization and focus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. If given two weeks to complete a task, people will take two weeks; weekly reviews prevent this slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
*   **Clear, Individual Goals** Each team member, whether a software engineer or a salesperson, has a clear understanding of their weekly tasks and sales targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. This allows for autonomy while ensuring accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
*   **Hyper-Focused Roles** Individuals are encouraged to be "obsessed about one particular thing" related to their core function, minimizing distractions from other departments or regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   **Strategic Fundraising** When raising capital, Instant strategically timed its Series A round for the end of the year to put pressure on investors to move quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. They also created a sense of urgency by implying they already had term sheets, accelerating the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This led to raising $18 million in just 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Hiring for Speed and Drive** Instant seeks talent with inherent energy and a desire to move quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>. They look for competitive individuals who are good communicators and embrace a culture of urgency, rather than overthinking or slowing down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.
*   **Streamlining Operations** To maximize the time employees spend on core tasks, Instant centralized its operations team early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>. This offloads administrative tasks like prospecting, updating CRMs, or chasing external updates, allowing sales and marketing teams to focus purely on selling and generating leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>. Hiring an Executive Assistant as the eighth hire was a "controversial" but crucial unlock for the CEO's productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>.

### Leadership and Culture

Millwood emphasizes that leaders must lead with positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. A positive culture, not one filled with "rainbow fairy floss perks," helps motivate employees, especially when faced with challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. This positive environment, combined with clear direction and support, encourages personal growth and continuous achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.

A "tight group" within the core leadership team, where trust and direct communication are paramount, prevents unnecessary pressure and stress from rippling through the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>.

### Challenges and Outlook

Balancing rapid revenue growth with long-term product vision and global expansion is a continuous challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. For Instant, everything, including product development, ultimately "ladders up to revenue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>. Even engineers and product managers have revenue targets, ensuring new features contribute directly to growth or retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.

When expanding globally, particularly into the US market, Millwood advises treating it almost like starting a new business, rebuilding brand reputation and talent from the ground up, rather than expecting immediate replication of domestic success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.

The company's goal is to become the "best growing company in Australia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a> and achieve a billion-dollar valuation within the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This ambition is fueled by a relentless drive to prove people wrong and right, and to build something truly exceptional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.

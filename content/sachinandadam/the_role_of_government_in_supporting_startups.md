Malcolm Turnbull, former Australian Prime Minister, emphasizes that the most important aspect of innovation is attitude, specifically being prepared to approach a problem differently tomorrow than today, without assuming that "we've always done it this way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He believes that to succeed in the world of technology, innovation is key to driving productivity and competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Government Initiatives and Impact on the Tech Sector

During his nearly three years as Prime Minister, Turnbull led significant reforms aimed at fostering Australia's technology sector. His government introduced the National Innovation and Science Agenda (NISA), which included approximately 24 measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

Key initiatives included:
*   **Tax Incentives** for [[investing_in_startups_and_early_stage_companies | investors in startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **New Innovation Funds**, such as the medical research fund and Main Sequence Ventures (CSIRO fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

These measures had a significant impact, leading to a substantial increase in [[investing_in_australian_tech_startups | venture capital in Australia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Dave Shane, founder of OIF, suggests that the [[impact_of_the_startup_ecosystem_in_australia | Australian startup sector]] is as large or larger than Israel's, a country often lauded as a "startup nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Previously, there was a major shortage of capital in Australia for tech, forcing companies like Aussie Mail to go public in the United States in the 1990s due to lack of local funding options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the ease of raising money for speculative mining ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Turnbull is most proud of the positive and authentic public discourse around innovation that the NISA generated, which he believes was crucial in shifting culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

## Government as a Customer and Partner

Turnbull highlights the importance of government departments acting as active supporters and customers for Australian startups and early-stage companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. There is a tendency for governments to prefer dealing with larger, established companies due to risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. However, a contract from the government is seen as more valuable than a grant by startups, as it provides validation and allows for valuable feedback and learning through a business relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

A critical area for this is defense, which tends to be conservative and prefers buying foreign technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Turnbull strongly advocated for Australian sovereignty and industry, emphasizing that national security is linked to the ability to build, design, maintain, and sustain technology within Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. This includes ensuring that when dealing with international partners, the Australian government actively advances its own tech rather than just being a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

An example of successful [[collaboration_between_private_technology_companies_and_government | private technology companies and government]] is Advanced Navigation, an Australian company providing world-leading inertial navigation technology. This tech is crucial for military and other applications, especially given the vulnerability of satellites, highlighting the importance of Australian innovation in areas like [[role_of_startups_in_space_surveillance_and_satellite_monitoring | space surveillance and satellite monitoring]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>.

## Overcoming Political Risk Aversion

A significant weakness in politics, according to Turnbull, is risk aversion and a reluctance to admit when something is not working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. In contrast, the tech sector embraces "fail fast," where smart [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_advice | entrepreneurs]] quickly cut ideas that aren't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

Turnbull advises setting expectations clearly, stating that not all measures will work, and those that don't will be "dumped" while successful ones will be expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. He notes that if every investment made by a fund manager is successful, it suggests they are not taking enough risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. He advocates for a cultural shift where failure is seen as an opportunity to learn, as "you learn more from failure" than from success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

> "I think the most important thing with Innovation is actually attitude. I think the important thing is always to be prepared to address a problem tomorrow differently than the way you did it today not to assume that we've always done it this way so that's critically important." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>
>
> "If every single one of them is successful then I'm not taking enough risk cuz I'm just basically making one safe bed after another." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>
>
> "Where failure is seen as an okay thing that you learn from failures, you go into you learn more from failure." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>

## Future Focus for Australian Government

If he were Prime Minister today, Turnbull would prioritize three areas:

1.  **Innovation and supporting Australian technology and industry** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>. This includes addressing areas where not enough is currently being done.
2.  **Clean energy transition** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. Australia has the potential to become a zero-emission country, with projects like pumped hydro being a key part of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.
3.  **Keeping Australia united** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. Australia is a highly multicultural society, and efforts to divide people on racial or religious grounds must be resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. This point also relates to [[the_role_of_media_in_tech_entrepreneurship | the role of media]] and the dangers of hyper-partisanship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

Regarding emerging technologies like AI and deepfakes, Turnbull believes it will become necessary to criminalize online impersonation that is not solely for satirical purposes, especially given the potential for financial fraud and political manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. He acknowledges that "you can't hold Tech back" and that regulations should focus on imposing penalties for misuse rather than banning technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.

The year 2023 marked the beginning of the "year of [[ai_agents_and_their_practical_applications_in_business | AI agents]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, with these digital entities moving from theory to practical application. This shift has raised questions about their role in the [[future_of_jobs_and_skills_in_an_aidriven_world | future of work]] and whether they will [[impact_of_ai_on_employment_and_the_future_of_work | replace]] or [[artificial_intelligence_and_workforce_transformation | augment]] human employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## What is an AI Agent?

An [[ai_agents_and_their_practical_applications_in_business | AI agent]] is defined as an autonomous reasoning digital worker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. They function much like an [[artificial_intelligence_and_workforce_transformation | AI employee]] or coworker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, capable of performing actions, thinking for themselves beyond pre-set rules, and improving with experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Unlike human counterparts, they do not require sleep and can work 24/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. It is anticipated that the future will see billions of [[ai_agents_and_their_practical_applications_in_business | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, working collaboratively with human colleagues on platforms like Slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## The Emergence of AI Agents

The widespread conversation around [[artificial_intelligence_and_workforce_transformation | AI]] intensified over the past few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The notion of [[ai_agents_and_their_practical_applications_in_business | AI agents]] specifically gained momentum in early 2023, largely due to the emergence of platforms like LangChain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. LangChain enabled the chaining together of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their use with various tools, leading to significant capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

This breakthrough meant [[ai_agents_and_their_practical_applications_in_business | AI agents]] could perform complex tasks such as deep research, ordering food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, and even generating software from text-to-action commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. A key development is the ability for multiple [[ai_agents_and_their_practical_applications_in_business | agents]] to collaborate to solve new problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

The mainstream release of ChatGPT in 2022 was a pivotal moment, causing a mix of excitement and fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. While it offered the potential to significantly speed up tasks like research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, it also triggered an "existential [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society | AI]] crisis" for many companies, prompting them to explore how to integrate [[artificial_intelligence_and_workforce_transformation | AI]] into their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Impact on the Workforce

The rise of [[ai_agents_and_their_practical_applications_in_business | AI agents]] is expected to significantly change jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Concerns have been raised about the displacement of roles, particularly in white-collar sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Junior roles in areas like administration, research, sales, and financial modeling are considered "dangerously close" to being replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. For example, tasks performed by consultants, such as presentations, formatting, and Excel modeling, are now potentially replaceable by [[ai_agents_and_their_practical_applications_in_business | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

However, the perspective isn't solely about job displacement. The introduction of [[ai_agents_and_their_practical_applications_in_business | AI agents]] can also lead to increased productivity and the creation of more diverse goods and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Rather than eliminating jobs, it might allow existing employees to be promoted to more exciting roles. For instance, in sales, automating the repetitive tasks of Business Development Representatives (BDRs) can free them up to become Account Executives, leading to more complex and engaging work, and ultimately creating more opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. The shift signifies that [[ai_agents_and_their_practical_applications_in_business | AI agents]] are not necessarily "coming for your job" but are "coming to change it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Adapting to Change

The rapid transformation of the workforce raises fundamental questions about identity, purpose, and the future of skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Historical precedent shows that societal change, driven by innovation, is constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Just as the internet restructured the workforce, [[artificial_intelligence_and_workforce_transformation | AI]] is expected to do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The emergence of new roles, such as "social media manager" which did not exist 15 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, illustrates how the job market evolves. The challenge lies in adapting and retraining for the [[future_of_jobs_and_skills_in_an_aidriven_world | jobs]] that will emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Industry Adoption and Competition: The Case of Relevance AI

The year 2024 has been marked by enterprise adoption of [[ai_agents_and_their_practical_applications_in_business | AI agents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, with major companies like Salesforce rebranding as [[artificial_intelligence_and_workforce_transformation | AI agent]] businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This has created a "global arms race" to develop [[artificial_intelligence_and_workforce_transformation | AI]] technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, with trillions of dollars being invested by tech giants such as Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

Amidst this intense competition, a Sydney-based startup called Relevance AI has emerged as a key player in the [[ai_agents_and_their_practical_applications_in_business | AI agent]] revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Employment Hero, an Australian software company specializing in HR and payroll solutions, has grown into a billion-dollar entity by focusing on [[rapid_company_growth_and_expansion_strategies | strategic expansion]] and adapting to global workforce trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. CEO Ben Thompson discusses how the company has navigated challenging macroeconomic environments and successfully built a global, remote-first workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Navigating Economic Challenges and Maintaining Growth

Despite market turmoil in the tech industry, Employment Hero has maintained strong performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This resilience is attributed to an early and consistent focus on tight unit economics, a principle instilled since their Series A and B funding rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The company has seen exceptional net revenue retention and strong growth rates, partly due to the tight employment market which has made recruitment a key problem for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## The Case for Remote Work and a Global Workforce

Ben Thompson's "Master Plan Part Two" was specifically dedicated to sustaining remote work globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. He believes remote work offers significant benefits:
*   **Flexibility** for working parents, individuals with disabilities, and pet carers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Access to Talent** in rural communities and developing countries, empowering people to contribute equally regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Advances like Starlink are connecting billions globally to the world of work and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

Thompson critiques the push for a full return to office, especially for knowledge workers, arguing it limits recruitment pools to small geographical areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. He also contends that most great ideas come from "intense thought" by individuals, not necessarily from "serendipitous moments" or brainstorming sessions in an office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The "hybrid" model is considered the "worst of both worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

## Challenges of Building a Global Workforce

Employing people internationally presents numerous complexities:
*   **Legal Differences:** Variations in public holidays, long service leave, workers' compensation laws, and termination/redundancy procedures across states and countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Logistical Hurdles:** Managing different time zones, language barriers, and cultural nuances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. For small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), these challenges can be particularly daunting due to limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Employment Hero's Solution: Global Teams

Employment Hero developed its "Global Teams" product specifically to help SMEs build and manage a global workforce with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Platform:** The platform establishes employing entities in various countries, integrates legal minimum entitlements into its system, and organizes payroll and recruitment services globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Integrated HR Features:** It includes a robust HR platform for one-on-ones, performance reviews, HR files, and pay files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
*   **Streamlined Recruitment:** The platform connects to approximately 1,500 different job boards worldwide, including LinkedIn, allowing users to post jobs and find talent globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.
*   **Rapid Onboarding:** Once talent is found, Employment Hero's Global Teams platform can onboard a new employee remotely in as little as eight minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

For a startup in Sydney, Global Teams could facilitate hiring virtual assistants, bookkeepers, engineers, and sales development representatives (SDRs) from countries like the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, or New Zealand, providing access to diverse skills at competitive rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. This enables businesses to [[rapid_company_growth_and_expansion_strategies | expand their go-to-market strategies]] and test new international markets more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

## [[developing_a_company_culture_during_rapid_growth | Developing a Company Culture During Rapid Growth]] in a Remote Global Environment

Employment Hero's workforce grew from 180 to 825 employees primarily by recruiting remotely, giving them a "remote-first" competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. Key strategies for [[developing_a_company_culture_during_rapid_growth | building and maintaining culture]] include:
*   **Asynchronous Communication:** Emphasizing recorded video or audio messages, allowing employees to respond at their convenience, often leading to more considered responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
*   **Clear Objectives and Key Results (OKRs):** Providing employees with autonomy and trust to achieve challenging goals independently, while aligning with company objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.
*   **Technological Solutions:** Leveraging real-time transcription and on-the-fly language translation for meetings, facilitating seamless cross-cultural communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.
*   **Embracing Diversity:** A global remote workforce naturally embodies diversity in cultures, religions, races, languages, and genders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.
*   **Global Gatherings:** To foster social connections and camaraderie lost in a remote setting, Employment Hero organizes an annual "Global Gathering" where all employees are offered an all-expense-paid trip to a foreign country (e.g., Thailand, Vietnam) for five days of team building and fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

## Future Vision and New Products

Employment Hero aims to become the world's largest platform for managing human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. This vision moves beyond traditional "point solutions" (like separate recruitment, onboarding, HR, and payroll tools) to a unified platform that simplifies the entire employment lifecycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.

The goal is to provide "talented labor working productively in your business as fast as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. By understanding that the entire planet is their talent pool, they believe they can provide talent for "every role" on their platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.

### Swag: The Employment Super App

Swag is Employment Hero's first consumer app, designed to leverage the collective buying power of the million-plus people managed by their platform, which represents over $75 billion in buying power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.
*   **Instapay:** This feature gives employees real-time access to their earned wages, aiming for a future where people are paid hourly, with money ticking into their bank accounts as they work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.
*   **Value Proposition for Employees:** Swag aims to create a compelling value proposition for candidates and employees by offering discounts and combining features for finding work, managing work, getting paid, spending, and saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>.
*   **Automated CV:** As employees work through the Employment Hero platform, their CV is automatically updated to the hour, detailing hours worked and roles performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.

### International Expansion and AI

Employment Hero is also aggressively expanding into markets like the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>. Furthermore, they are developing and releasing new Artificial Intelligence (AI) features, with Horizon 2 and Horizon 3 features planned for future release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>. The ultimate vision is for Employment Hero to be the primary source of productive, skilled talent that powers businesses, with its tools supercharging employee performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.

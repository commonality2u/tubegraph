The co-founders of Human Health, Georgia Viau and Kate Lamberis, were motivated by their personal experiences with [[challenges_in_navigating_the_healthcare_system | challenges navigating the healthcare system]] and chronic illnesses in their families to create a startup addressing these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Their startup, Human Health, aims to tackle the widespread problem of misdiagnosis, slow medical systems, and a lack of new technology and innovation in healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Personal Motivations Behind Human Health

Both co-founders have deeply personal stories that highlight the urgent need for better health management and awareness.

### Georgia Viau's Experience
Georgia's initial motivation stemmed from losing her father, which highlighted many issues within the health and hospital system in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:33">[03:47:33]</a>. A significant part of her family has struggled with serious mental illnesses, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and manic depression, making mental health a common backdrop throughout her childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:13">[04:39:13]</a>. She also experienced her own mental health challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

### Kate Lamberis's Experience
Health has been a constant presence in Kate's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. She lost her mother to an aggressive form of lung cancer when she was 16, and three years later, her father to Parkinson's disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>. These experiences with chronic disease occurred at a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.

Her main motivations, however, came from her children's health struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:05">[05:21:05]</a>. Her daughter, at around 17-18 months old, stopped talking, responding to her name, playing with toys, and sleeping, leading to a diagnosis of autism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. After months of waiting for a diagnosis and being told little could be done beyond speech therapy, Kate sought other solutions through extensive research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. Her daughter, now 8, lives a perfectly normal life and attends mainstream school, defying doctors who predicted she would spend her life in an institution and never talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

Later, her son began exhibiting similar symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, including a distinctive rash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. This repeated experience, even more severe with her son, solidified Kate's commitment to finding solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. She realized that being at home would not help her son because solutions were lacking, driving her to "go look for solutions" through Human Health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.

## The Problem and Human Health's Solution

The healthcare system often struggles with misdiagnosis, slow processes, and a lack of technological innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. [[Trends in Health and Wellness | Mental illness]] is on the rise, with conditions like schizophrenia and anxiety increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. Approximately 25% of the population at any given time is suffering from a mental health diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:25">[04:54:25]</a>. Autism spectrum disorder is also common, with the World Health Organization estimating at least 1 in 100 people have the diagnosis, and some experts suggest it could be twice as many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. Cases of autism in US children have more than tripled in the past 20 years and are still rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

Human Health, now known as Human Health, is a tool for patients and caregivers to track health information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>. It allows users to:
*   Track symptoms and treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.
*   Learn what treatments are working for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>.
*   Share information with healthcare providers to advocate for deserved care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>.

The company primarily serves individuals with existing chronic diagnoses, with most users tracking more than one condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>. A key challenge in the product's development is translating complex medical information into an easily understandable format for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Guiding Principles

Building health tech startups is inherently challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. One of the most challenging moments for Human Health was the initial launch of the product, as it felt like only a fraction of their ultimate vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.

### AI Safety and Data Privacy
The co-founders approach [[ai_doctors_and_the_future_of_healthcare | AI]] integration cautiously, adhering to the medical principle of "first, do no harm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>. Their goal is for the app to be helpful and provide information that genuinely aids users on their health journeys, without causing harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>.

Trust is paramount, with strong emphasis on:
*   **Security:** Keeping user data safe and secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>.
*   **Privacy:** Not sharing or selling user data to third parties, not showing ads, and ensuring users have control over their data, including the right to request deletion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>. They anonymize data for metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>. These principles align with global data protection regulations like GDPR and HIPAA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>.

## Company Culture and Values

The co-founders focused on creating a compassionate work environment that challenges the stereotype of tech companies requiring constant, flat-out work without [[balancing_work_life_and_personal_wellbeing | work-life balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. They aim for a culture where people can bring their whole selves to work and feel safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. Recruiting individuals who match this energy and possess both exceptional skill and the right aptitude for this culture proved to be a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.

### Definition of Success
For the co-founders, success is not solely about achieving a "billion-dollar business" or a destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>. They emphasize the "success of each day," focusing on daily achievements, team well-being, and feeling good about the work accomplished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>. This incremental approach, valuing the journey and impact, defines their definition of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>.

Their shared life experiences, including losing loved ones and experiencing illness, changed their perspective on life and what they truly value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>. They do not value themselves based on whether Human Health becomes a massive company, but rather on how they operate within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>. Their primary motivation is helping people and alleviating the despair that comes with a diagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>.

Airwallex, a technology company founded by Jack Zhang, is revolutionizing how businesses operate globally, aiming to build critical economic infrastructure for global entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. The company, last valued at $8 billion, is considered one of Australia's great tech startup stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:43">[01:33:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## Complexity of the Fintech Sector

[[building_a_fintech_company_and_understanding_the_future_of_payments | Building a fintech company]] presents unique and significant [[challenges_in_the_fintech_and_banking_industry | challenges in the fintech and banking industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:36">[03:03:36]</a>. Jack Zhang emphasizes that unlike typical software development, fintech requires deep consideration of risk, compliance, and regulatory issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. It operates as a real-time system where any failure can have a severe impact on businesses and the livelihoods of entrepreneurs globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

### Regulatory Hurdles and Resistance to Innovation
A significant challenge in the fintech industry is navigating the regulatory landscape, where some regulators are resistant to innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>. Financial systems often have complex governance structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Jack highlights that regulatory shifts occur very slowly, over years, rather than weeks or months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:32:00">[26:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46:00">[27:46:00]</a>.

In Australia, for instance, obtaining a Payment Purchase Facility license is difficult, with only a few companies holding one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>. The regulation requires a 4% capital custodian in proportion to customer funds, which Jack argues makes no sense for a non-lending entity like Airwallex, effectively favoring traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>. Airwallex, alongside companies like Wise, advocates for mandatory FX spread disclosure for major banks, which currently can charge 4-5% spread without transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>.

### Market-Specific Challenges
Operating in diverse global markets presents varying degrees of difficulty due to unique financial systems and governance:
*   Some countries lack real-time payment networks like Australia's NPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>.
*   Local payment networks may not accept fixed remittance names, complicating fraud detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>.
*   Legacy systems are often difficult to access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>.
*   Banks in some regions view fintechs as threats rather than potential partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>.
*   Cultural and educational efforts are required to convince stakeholders of the benefits of an open economy and network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:33:00">[21:33:00]</a>.

Countries like Japan, Indonesia, UAE, and Saudi Arabia are noted as particularly challenging markets to enter due to these factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>.

## Fintech Innovation and Vision

Jack Zhang's motivation for Airwallex has shifted from achieving a "trillion-dollar company" valuation to a deep-seated mission of empowering entrepreneurs globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>. The company aims to provide economic infrastructure that allows businesses to operate anywhere, anytime, growing beyond borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>. This involves building a single, vertically integrated payment and financial platform for modern businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>.

Airwallex seeks to simplify international business operations, aiming to prevent other entrepreneurs from experiencing the difficulties Jack faced when dealing with large financial institutions that dismissed his startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>.

### Perspective on Web3 and Digital Currencies
Regarding the [[the_future_impact_of_blockchain_and_fintech_in_emerging_markets | future impact of blockchain and fintech in emerging markets]], Jack Zhang holds a skeptical view on Web3 and cryptocurrency as solutions for global payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:00]</a>. He argues that current payment systems, like Airwallex's, already offer real-time, low-cost, or even free transactions globally, processing nearly $200 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>. He questions what problem cryptocurrencies solve in this context, stating: "You cannot be cheaper than free. You cannot be faster than instant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:00">[22:45:00]</a>.

While acknowledging potential use cases for countries with hyper-volatile currencies (e.g., Kenya, Turkey, Argentina) where even Bitcoin might offer less volatility than local currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>, he notes these are not major use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. The core philosophy of digital currency – creating open networks and transparency in monetary policy – is fundamentally in conflict with central banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a>. He has not observed significant social value or benefits from blockchain technology in the last 15 years, unlike AI which shows weekly and monthly life-changing events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>.

### Focus on Reality Over Utopia
Jack does not believe in a "utopian financial future" but rather advocates for continuously creating better experiences within the existing regulatory framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:34:00">[25:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:48:00">[25:48:00]</a>. This involves constant communication with regulators, sharing insights from customers and infrastructure to advocate for changes, even if such changes are slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:13:00">[26:13:00]</a>. The goal is to build the right products in the right order to ensure Airwallex is a true partner for customer success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>.

The Satchmo and Adam Show hosts reflect on their [[personal_growth_and_work_life_balance | personal growth]] and [[selfdevelopment_and_selfawareness | self-awareness]] since starting their podcast. They note that the podcast, now 53 episodes deep, began unintentionally but has become a significant learning experience through interactions with various guests, from politicians to student entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This journey has transformed them, sharpening their interests into specific areas like entrepreneurship, technology, and investing, which align with their long-term goal of starting a venture capital fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## The Evolution of Self
The hosts emphasize the importance of [[the_role_of_values_and_self_reflection_in_personal_and_business_growth | reflection]] and challenging their own thinking, particularly concerning dominant topics in their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

One host shares that his early university years focused on [[selfdevelopment_and_selfawareness | self-awareness]], gained through experiences like travel, leading to a deeper understanding of himself and his preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Later, the podcast significantly informed his practical understanding of the world, including industries, career paths, and trying different roles through internships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Practical Methods for Self-Discovery
Learning more about oneself has primarily come from podcasts and consistently meeting new people for coffees every couple of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This networking helped scope out different job environments and industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The host feels wiser, with a better grasp of how the world operates, and meeting various leaders has boosted his confidence by revealing their human struggles, counteracted by their passion and drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

The process of choosing a career path, such as shifting from investment banking to consulting, has been iterative, involving conversations with many individuals and continuous [[the_role_of_values_and_self_reflection_in_personal_and_business_growth | reflection]] on desired work and future vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Discovering a strong resonance with a guest's daily work, like Adam Milgrom's social impact venture capital firm, solidified their vision and led them to pursue a path that felt right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Shifting Focus and Mindset
The podcast's content has shifted from general topics to more specific ones, particularly in investing and technology, as they found a concentrated area of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. There has also been a move away from explicit [[selfimprovement_selftalk_and_personal_development | self-development]] discussions, as routines and habits have become ingrained rather than subjects of constant thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

While acknowledging the value of [[selfdevelopment_and_selfawareness | self-development]] resources for initial [[personal_growth_and_work_life_balance | growth]]—likening them to a "biggest bang for buck"—the hosts believe that after a certain point, these resources tend to repeat themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The core lesson from such books, like "Think and Grow Rich," is the [[changing_beliefs_and_personal_growth | growth mindset]] and the belief in individual opportunity to pursue aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Once this foundation of self-belief is established, focus shifts to more practical, tactical pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

## Insights for Personal Growth
The hosts offer advice for university students and individuals at 18:
*   **Networking:** Meet and have coffees with more experienced people, whether they are older students or professionals in desired fields. This provides valuable insights into university success, internships, and potential career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Imposter Syndrome:** Don't hesitate to pursue interests, even if they seem advanced. Dive straight into experiences to learn faster, even if it's to discover something isn't the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>.
*   **Addressing Personal Challenges:** Sort out personal "baggage" or trauma through [[the_role_of_values_and_self_reflection_in_personal_and_business_growth | reflection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. Acknowledging that past experiences, particularly [[personal_growth_and_resilience_from_childhood_experiences | childhood experiences]] and family dynamics, shape who we are is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.
    *   **Strategies:** Engage in open conversations with friends, consider therapy, and practice [[the_role_of_values_and_self_reflection_in_personal_and_business_growth | journaling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. The shift in society towards greater [[selfdevelopment_and_selfawareness | vulnerability]] and discussions on mental health makes this more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** Unpacking unconscious motives and predispositions can lead to greater happiness and alignment with one's true desires, even if it challenges established career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.
*   **Defining Values and Vision:** Reflect on core values, what kind of person one wants to be remembered as, and what a "perfect day" or desired life looks like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. This helps avoid being swayed by others' motivations and maintains focus on one's own path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>.

## The Twenties: A Time for Intentional Exploration
The hosts view their twenties as a foundational period for building the life they desire, rather than merely "mucking around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>. They advocate for intentional, directional exploration, even when traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. This means cultivating skills, building networks, and advancing careers with purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. They acknowledge that for some, this intentional approach might feel like work, but for them, it's enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>.

Their goal is to maximize opportunities and take "risk-on" ventures in their twenties, such as starting a business, extended travel, or living overseas, before potential future constraints like family arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>. They prioritize seeking out environments with ambitious people and new experiences that generate excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>. While financial freedom is a long-term objective, they are willing to prolong it slightly for enriching experiences in their twenties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.

However, they also caution against the pressure to have everything "figured out" in one's twenties, emphasizing that there's nothing wrong with exploring or pursuing different paths later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>. Their ongoing journey is a testament to continuous [[changing_beliefs_and_personal_growth | evolution]], [[the_role_of_values_and_self_reflection_in_personal_and_business_growth | reflection]], and embracing curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.

Max, the co-founder of Superpower, emphasizes that [[the_importance_of_team_and_hiring | talent]] is the single most crucial factor in building a company. He believes that the team you build is the company you build, asserting that [[the_importance_of_team_and_hiring | talent]] dictates how a product is distributed and developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>. He aims for Superpower to have the highest quality team in the world in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.

## General Principles of Hiring

Superpower's core team is strong in technology, marketing, and consumer products, which aligns with the future of healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. However, a current weakness identified is the "operational and human side of things," an area where they are actively [[identifying_and_hiring_talent_in_startups | hiring]] to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. To achieve significant scale (10x growth), the company needs to become proficient in the human aspect of its operations, which involves [[the_importance_of_team_and_hiring | hiring]] and training many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

> "The team you build is the company you build. There's this meme of what matters more, product or distribution. And the answer is neither, right? It's always talent because the people determine how you distribute your product and how you go to market. The people determine the the product you build." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>

Max highlights that leading figures like Sam Altman and Elon Musk dedicate a significant portion of their time (30-50%) to [[the_importance_of_team_and_hiring | hiring]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>. He suggests that while it's commonly heard, founders rarely allocate that much time to [[the_importance_of_team_and_hiring | hiring]], but they increasingly should <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>.

## Identifying and Acquiring Talent

Max advises trusting intuition when [[identifying_and_hiring_talent_in_startups | identifying talent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. He believes that conventional interviewing methods hinder the use of intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.

Instead of focusing on specific roles that need to be filled, which often leads to [[the_importance_of_team_and_hiring | hiring]] older specialists with proven track records, Max advocates for an alternative approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.

[!TIP]
Max suggests creating an internal "forcing function" to hire:
*   **Brilliant Generalists**: Seek out younger individuals who have steep growth curves but haven't yet proven themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.
*   **Proactive Placement**: If a brilliant person is encountered, regardless of age, consider how they could fit into the company even if a specific role doesn't exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>. These individuals will naturally identify and capitalize on opportunities and constraints within the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.

### Key Indicators for Talent
When [[identifying_and_hiring_talent_in_startups | identifying talent]], look for "spiky things" in a person's background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>:
*   Something exceptional they've done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.
*   Something non-conventional or that bucks the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.
*   Avoid simply [[the_importance_of_team_and_hiring | hiring]] people who are merely "good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Considerations

Max acknowledges that finding great people takes a considerable amount of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.

In a world progressing towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), traditional information-based skills like knowledge, coding, and basic operational tasks will become commoditized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.

[!WARNING]
Max warns against "tech bros" who hide that relationships between people are the truly scarce and valuable asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. He argues that top tech leaders like Sam Altman and Elon Musk are actually "people bros" who understand the importance of human connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. In a post-AGI world, people will remain crucial as "gatekeepers" and sources of defensible value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>.

He predicts that white-collar professions, especially junior roles that involve busy work and skill-based tasks, will be significantly impacted as AI "squares any output," leading to increased inequality in skill and talent distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>. This suggests that the ability to be a "100xer" (someone who produces 100 times the output) will be more critical than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

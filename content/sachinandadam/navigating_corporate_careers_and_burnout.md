Kirsten Hunter, former CEO and co-founder of Future Super, reflects on her journey through corporate roles at a law firm and Bain Consulting, highlighting the challenges of maintaining [[balancing_work_life_and_personal_wellbeing | personal well-being]] and avoiding burnout in demanding environments. Her career path, which included studying Arts, Law, and Science at UNSW, working for a top consultancy, and then starting her own venture, is often seen as an aspirational model for those seeking to [[journey_from_employment_to_entrepreneurship | transition from employment to entrepreneurship]] while remaining true to personal values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## The "Type A" Personality and Corporate Life
Kirsten describes herself as a "super smart nerdy kid" who, from school, had to be very self-motivated and provide her own structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This innate drive was further shaped by her diverse and demanding academic and professional experiences, including studying medicine, arts, and law, and taking a year off to lead the UNSW Union during a period of significant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This highly driven, "Type A" personality, while instrumental to success, also posed challenges when navigating intense corporate environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Understanding Burnout
Kirsten experienced burnout "regularly" in her corporate career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. She notes that if you are someone driven by internal milestones, corporate environments can "really suck whatever energy that you're willing to give them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Specific instances of burnout occurred during her time as a lawyer at Freehills and as a consultant at Bain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. For example, a prolonged, highly demanding legal case led to significant burnout, making her question her career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

## Strategies for Prevention and Well-being
Over time, Kirsten learned crucial lessons about preventing and managing burnout:
*   **Awareness of Energy Levels** Being "really aware of my own energy" and recognizing when one is "flat" due to lack of sleep or personal circumstances is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing Self-Care** Giving oneself permission to take breaks, mental health days, and building in time for sleep and exercise are essential learnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Learning to Say No** This is a critical skill, especially for those entering the corporate world, to manage overwhelming commitments and maximize overall happiness and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. It's a "lifetime of learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Building Control** Having more control over one's environment, as she did at Future Super, helped reduce instances of burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Developing a "Two-Tracked Career"** For a period, Kirsten maintained a corporate day job while being "really motivated by the community work on the side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. This balance initially provided energy and purpose.

## The Impact of Parenthood on Career Trajectory
Parenthood acted as a significant turning point in Kirsten's career, pushing her to re-evaluate her priorities and actively pursue [[balancing_career_goals_with_personal_life_and_family | aligning her career with her values]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>:
*   **Time Constraints** Returning to work part-time after having her daughter made it difficult to maintain the "juggle" of being a great parent, a great consultant, and also doing volunteering work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. This imbalance led to a decline in energy for her corporate role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.
*   **Climate Change Awareness** During sleepless nights with her newborn, Kirsten became deeply concerned by climate change reports, realizing its direct impact on her daughter's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. This realization that her "brain output" was primarily helping companies make money, rather than directly helping the community, prompted a desire for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **Seeking Alignment** She began seeking a role that would allow her to bring her corporate skills and community passion together, leading her to Future Super <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

## Transitioning from Corporate to Social Enterprise
Kirsten's [[career_transition_from_corporate_law_to_social_enterprise | transition from corporate law and consulting to social enterprise]] was influenced by a desire for greater purpose and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. She valued the lessons learned in her corporate life, stating she "could not have done the job that I did at Future Super if I hadn't have spent those 10 years as a lawyer and as a consultant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>. These skills included:
*   **Work Ethic:** Learning to work hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **Peer Network:** Understanding the value of peer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
*   **Mentorship:** Recognizing the importance of mentors and sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   **Asking Questions and Problem Solving:** Consulting taught her to be comfortable "knowing nothing" and to ask questions to quickly get up to speed in unfamiliar industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. This "outsider" perspective can offer valuable insights and frameworks for solutions that insiders might miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.

She embraced the role of a "corporate entrepreneur," constantly seeking ways to improve the companies she worked for while also engaging in community work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. She advises young people to "never too early to start to shape the company that you work for" by asking questions and advocating for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.

## Lifelong Learning and Future Outlook
Kirsten emphasizes that everyone is "just figuring it out as they go along" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:25">[00:55:25]</a>, encouraging young professionals not to fear asking questions or feeling uninformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>. She believes a new economic system is possible where profit is linked to positive impact, driven by consumer and employee demand for ethical practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>.

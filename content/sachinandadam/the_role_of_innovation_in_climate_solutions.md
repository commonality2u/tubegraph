The Regen Ventures event in New York gathered leading figures in the climate space to discuss the crucial role of [[the_role_of_design_and_innovation_in_business_success | innovation]] and [[climate_change_and_storytelling | storytelling]] in addressing climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Attendees included notable figures like Seth Godin and Alex Honnold, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of the climate challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Nature of Innovation

[[the_role_of_design_and_innovation_in_business_success | Innovation]] is described as a "stepwise process" that differentiates a successful company from one that merely builds a tool and stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This deliberate habit of continuous progression is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Prepared vs. Ready
Seth Godin distinguishes between being "prepared" and "ready" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. He uses the example of Gutenberg inventing the printing press before widespread literacy or reading glasses existed; Gutenberg was prepared, but not "ready" by conventional measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This gap is where [[the_role_of_design_and_innovation_in_business_success | innovation]] thrives, suggesting one must act before feeling completely ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### Breaking Down the Impossible
Alex Honnold highlights that many seemingly "impossible" challenges, like free solo climbing or addressing climate change, are in fact possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. For climbing, it's about putting in the work until something daunting becomes manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Similarly, for climate, the technology often exists, but there's a lack of "chutzpah" to deploy things quickly enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This process involves "grinding for a while" until solutions "look manageable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Innovation in Climate Solutions

The consensus is that anyone who examines the geo-planet and cultural systems cannot deny what is happening with climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The core question for innovators is how to navigate this transition period to create conditions for future thriving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Challenges to Adoption: [[challenges_in_the_adoption_of_climate_technology | The "Catch-22" of Climate Tech]]
A significant challenge for climate tech is the "storytelling problem," failing to engage the masses and build necessary movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Seth Godin notes that [[the_role_of_design_and_innovation_in_business_success | innovation]] and adoption are always unevenly distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. A major hurdle is the absence of a price on carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This creates a "catch-22": innovators are creating solutions for which there's no incentive to buy, but incentives won't emerge until the solutions exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### The Importance of a Carbon Price: [[combating_climate_change_through_investment | Market-Based Solutions]]
A proposed solution to incentivize climate solutions is a "carbon dividend plus border adjustment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. This involves collecting a fee for carbon emissions and distributing 100% of it directly back to citizens as a check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>. This mechanism leverages the market's efficiency in responding to costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>. As people become accustomed to these checks, they will change behavior, and prices will adjust, eventually leading to a financial incentive for businesses to lobby for this regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>. The border adjustment ensures that goods from other countries are also priced appropriately based on their carbon footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.

## Building a Regenerative Economy: Systems Thinking

The ultimate goal for [[the_role_of_design_and_innovation_in_business_success | innovation]] in climate is to build a regenerative economy that creates planetary-scale impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Ecosystem of Investment: [[combating_climate_change_through_investment | Collaborative Approaches]]
Seth Godin emphasizes that addressing climate change is a "systems problem" requiring a "system solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. It's not about individual blame (e.g., plastic water bottles), but about fixing the underlying system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. The investment ecosystem functions similarly, where foundational elements like infrastructure (e.g., T1 lines for early internet companies) enable broader [[entrepreneurship_and_innovation_in_developing_countries | development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

### Collaboration and Partnerships: [[role_of_cultural_and_environmental_factors_in_fostering_innovation | Collective Action]]
A critical aspect of [[the_role_of_design_and_innovation_in_business_success | innovation]] in climate is collaboration. The "Regen team" is praised for creating "system dynamics," encouraging founders to trade information and partner rather than operate in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. This is because the aim is not solely a return on equity, but to "heal a broken planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>, meaning the real win is an improved system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.

### Impact Beyond Financial Return
Current [[the_role_of_design_and_innovation_in_business_success | innovation]] aims to produce goods and services in ways that actively heal nature, focusing on planetary health, biodiversity, water, and nutrients, while simultaneously enhancing human lives without sacrificing convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

## Storytelling and Engagement: [[climate_change_and_storytelling | The Narrative of Change]]

Effective [[climate_change_and_storytelling | storytelling]] is paramount to drive the adoption of climate solutions.

### Creating Tension, Not Fear
Traditional climate [[climate_change_and_storytelling | storytelling]] has often relied on fear (e.g., "the planet is burning") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. However, fear tends to make people feel trapped, stuck, or leads to denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. Instead, Seth Godin advocates for creating "tension," like pulling a rubber band backward to propel it forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. This means framing the choice as an opportunity: "this bus is going there, if you want to go there you need to get on the bus now cause it's leaving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. This positive tension motivates action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

### Scaffolding and Systems Change
For system change, it's crucial to "shun the non-believers" who seek opposition for attention, as debating them won't change the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. Instead, focus on "scaffolding," a learning theory where teachers help learners overcome roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. Offering people "scaffolding" to engage with the climate story incrementally allows for deeper involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. This approach requires a clear "philosophy of becoming" and an understanding of how one's actions will shift the system over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.

## Specific Innovations and Their Impact

### Solar Energy Initiatives: [[social_impact_and_innovation_in_emerging_technologies | Energy Access and Development]]
Alex Honnold's Honnold Foundation supports [[social_impact_and_innovation_in_emerging_technologies | solar projects]] globally, aiming for a "win-win for both people and the environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. He recognized that people prioritize basic needs over environmental concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. With a billion people lacking access to power, solar energy provides a critical starting point for [[entrepreneurship_and_innovation_in_developing_countries | economic development]] and improved quality of life, allowing for more productive time after dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. The foundation focuses specifically on [[social_impact_and_innovation_in_emerging_technologies | solar projects]] that help human communities, doubling down on what has proven to be the most elegant solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.

### Nature's Resilience: [[naturebased_solutions_for_climate_change | The Power of Regeneration]]
Insights from the *Planet Visionaries* podcast reveal nature's surprising resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. If given "even the slightest chance," a natural ecosystem will regrow and blossom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>. This highlights the inspiring potential for [[naturebased_solutions_for_climate_change | nature-based solutions]] and the idea that humanity can "do things better so that we can leave more parts of the world available for nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

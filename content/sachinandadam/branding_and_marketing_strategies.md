Ellie Hansen, a principal investor at Sid Stage Ventures and a previously exited founder of several consumer companies, offers a masterclass in how to [[building_a_consumer_brand | build brand]] and stand out as a founder, drawing from her diverse career in advertising, founding businesses, and investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Her insights are particularly valuable for those interested in data and branding for their own startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

## Standing Out in a Competitive Market

In today's competitive go-to-market channels, it's crucial to be clear about your unique perspective and the "why" behind your actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:18:00">[43:18:00]</a>. Success hinges on identifying a "human insight" â€“ a relatable truth that resonates with people and makes them say, "Oh yeah, I've experienced that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:38:00">[43:38:00]</a>. Brands that win are those that grasp an honest truism about the human condition, allowing them to create a brand world and experience around that core insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:30:00">[44:30:00]</a>.

## Essential Strategies for Building a Resonant Brand

### Don't Let Perfect Be the Enemy of Done
When [[building_a_consumer_brand | building a consumer brand]], especially as a designer, the inclination might be to seek perfection before launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>. However, it's more important to prioritize quantity, get your message out frequently, and test and iterate based on feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:00">[24:28:00]</a>. Often, less polished or "imperfect" work, particularly in performance marketing, can resonate more effectively because it feels honest and true to the brand or founder story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>.

### Performance Marketing is Brand Work
Historically, advertising has separated "creative advertising" (big brand storytelling) from "performance marketing" (social media, driving clicks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:32:00">[31:32:00]</a>. However, a brand is every experience and expression for the customer, including social media, storefronts, websites, and packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:14:00">[32:14:00]</a>. For many, social media or performance marketing is where they interact most with a brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:31:00">[32:31:00]</a>. Therefore, performance marketing must be grounded in the overall brand storytelling and be true to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:03:00">[33:03:00]</a>. Separating them leads to disparate customer experiences and hinders success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:10:00">[33:10:00]</a>. Customer service, though not a traditional marketing channel, also plays a crucial role in brand perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:37:00">[33:37:00]</a>.

### Tune into Your Funnel Data
To effectively scale a business, founders must deeply understand and measure every data point in their customer funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:00">[25:38:00]</a>. Issues like low click-through rates, high bounce rates, or problems with add-to-cart or checkout are distinct creative issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:53:00">[25:53:00]</a>. Focusing only on overall metrics like Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) or Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) can obscure these crucial details, preventing effective testing and iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>. American consumer markets are particularly mature in their detailed understanding of this click-through and performance marketing funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:00">[26:43:00]</a>.

### Be Willing to Offend (or Polarize)
[[cultural_influences_on_branding | Cultural influences on branding]] play a significant role in how daring founders are with their brand messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:19:00">[45:19:00]</a>. Creating a brand that deeply resonates with 20% of people, even if 80% don't love it or are offended by it, is a powerful strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:26:00">[46:26:00]</a>. While scary, being bold and having contrarian opinions can help a brand stand out in a saturated market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:15:00">[46:15:00]</a>.

In Australia, the "tall poppy syndrome" can lead to a fear of standing out and being "cut down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:30:00">[47:30:00]</a>. This contrasts with the US, where there might be more leeway or forgiveness for risk-taking, and successes are celebrated more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:00:00">[48:00:00]</a>. Australian advertising, ironically, has a history of being willing to be offensive and is known for its world-class humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:15:00">[49:15:00]</a>. However, for founders, the stakes are higher when putting a business on the line with bold branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:17:00">[50:17:00]</a>.

The US market's competitive "dog eat dog" culture often requires companies to differentiate and beat competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:03:00">[53:03:00]</a>. Australia, with its "underdog" culture of competition, often celebrates beating the odds and focuses more on collaboration and egalitarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:21:00">[53:21:00]</a>. This leads to less focus on individual celebration and more on collective success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:04:00">[54:04:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Floss - Making Oral Care Fun

Ellie Hansen co-founded Floss, the world's first patented electric flosser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. Despite the unsexy nature of oral care, Floss aimed to infuse fun and a different experience into the category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:00">[37:00:00]</a>. Research revealed a lot of fear, stigma, and shame around oral health and dentists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:11:00">[37:11:00]</a>.

Floss defined itself as an "accessibility brand," focused on making flossing accessible to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:39:00">[38:39:00]</a>. They sought to inject humor, such as the brand line "good oral" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:49:00">[38:49:00]</a>, and explored the concept of "oral beauty," treating teeth and mouth care with the same aspirational approach as hair or skin care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:00">[39:50:00]</a>. This approach allowed them to gamify habit building and leverage behavioral science to encourage daily flossing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:14:00">[41:14:00]</a>.

Ellie's commitment to accessibility even led her to learn Braille to include it on product packaging, ensuring that every touchpoint reflected the core brand value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:54:00">[28:54:00]</a>.

## The Evolution of the Agency Model

Ellie's experience spans large agencies like Ogilvy, where she became a global director of design strategy, and her own "not an agency" venture, Tina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>.

Traditionally, venture capitalists have viewed agencies as not scalable due to low margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>. However, with the advent of AI, agencies are becoming increasingly higher margin, potentially making them more appealing for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:00">[19:56:00]</a>.

According to Hansen, a good agency prioritizes operational efficiencies to avoid bleeding cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>. But ultimately, what makes an agency truly good is its creative talent, and optimizing for their skill set and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>. Great agencies are built on great relationships, great people, and great culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>. While AI can improve operational efficiencies and output, the human element remains paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>.

Her experience in design and marketing in the agency world provided a crucial entry point into [[building_a_consumer_brand | consumer brands]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:00">[21:57:00]</a>. While storytelling and marketing are vital for a consumer brand, they are not everything; product quality and customer love are equally, if not more, important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.

## Personal Journey and Entrepreneurial Mindset

Ellie Hansen's career path, though seemingly diverse, is connected by an underlying entrepreneurial spirit. She describes herself as "stubborn" but also "easygoing" in allowing life to unfold and taking opportunities as they arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This blend allows her to meticulously optimize immediate tasks for success while maintaining a long-term, flexible perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. This approach correlates with consumer brand building, which requires adapting to trends and market taste rather than rigidly adhering to a fixed vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. As a designer, she balances stubborn intuition with the need to listen closely to what customers truly want, rather than what she thinks they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

A defining ideology from her upbringing is "nothing's a jail sentence," fostering a belief that if unhappy or unfulfilled, one has the power to change direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. Her background as a ballet dancer in an intense sports school instilled discipline, the ability to break down big goals, and strong self-direction and self-learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. These qualities are crucial for founders navigating the overwhelming to-do lists and prioritization challenges of a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

Her rapid rise at Ogilvy was attributed to not being afraid to express contrarian opinions and taking initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. She actively sought to understand internal operations and volunteered for extracurricular projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>. This entrepreneurial approach within a large organization allowed her to move from artist-in-residence to customer experience design, then global consulting, and eventually to redesigning Ogilvy's global operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>. Her background in a small and then medium family business also instilled a mindset of questioning the status quo and proactively fixing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>.

Her venture, Tina (This Is Not An Agency), started accidentally during her MBA as founders kept seeking her advice on branding, packaging, and fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>. A key lesson from Tina was to always ask: "Can I do this myself?" rather than immediately paying someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>. While imposter syndrome can lead one to believe others are better, it's essential to assess if a task truly requires a professional or if it can be figured out in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:59:00">[18:59:00]</a>.

Being an investor now allows Ellie to integrate all her past experiences to support founders, operating in what she considers her "best version of herself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. Sid Stage Ventures adopts a "founder-first" approach, where every activity is evaluated for its value to founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:55:00">[57:55:00]</a>. This involves having nuanced and detailed conversations with founders, drawing on their shared experience of tough decisions, such as setting valuation caps and choosing partners for a cap table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:17:00">[59:17:00]</a>. While this empathetic approach might make her "less of a shark" as an investor, it allows for deeper, more collaborative partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39:00">[01:00:39:00]</a>. The Australian VC ecosystem is seen as more collaborative than the US, fostering an "underdog" culture where winning is about beating the odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34:00">[01:01:34:00]</a>.

## Opportunities in the Consumer Market

The direct-to-consumer (DTC) economic model has changed significantly, with customer acquisition costs (CAC) rising dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38:00">[01:03:38:00]</a>. This has led to an "equalization" between retail and DTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06:00">[01:06:06:00]</a>. However, DTC validation is still often required to enter retail, meaning brands must still succeed in DTC, often through celebrity backing or sticky organic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12:00">[01:04:12:00]</a>.

The Australian consumer market presents unique opportunities for global expansion. While smaller, there are many successful Australian consumer brands like Aesop, Zimmerman, and Who Gives A Crap that have achieved global recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01:00">[01:05:01:00]</a>. The US market, in particular, highly reveres Australian lifestyle and brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21:00">[01:05:21:00]</a>. Geographical limitations are diminishing, allowing Australian brands to consider global expansion much earlier, including into Asian markets, a path US brands typically only explore after Series B funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02:00">[01:06:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31:00">[01:06:31:00]</a>. This creates potential for venture-scale returns on Australian consumer brands that might not have been possible before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08:00">[01:06:08:00]</a>.

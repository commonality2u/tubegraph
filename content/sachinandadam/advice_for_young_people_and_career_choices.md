Drawing insights from the career of former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, this guide offers [[lessons_and_advice_for_young_professionals_in_their_20s | advice for young people]] on career choices, [[networking_and_career_advice_for_university_students | networking]], and personal development. Turnbull's diverse and successful career spanning law, journalism, investment banking, and politics serves as a significant inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Key Lessons from Early Life
One of the most instructive episodes in Malcolm Turnbull's younger life was the Spycatcher trial, which he took on at 31 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Despite being given "no chance of success" against the British government and their expensive lawyers, he won the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

Lessons learned from this experience include:
*   **Don't be intimidated** by people with big titles or pretensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Pay attention to detail** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Being fastidious about interlocutory proceedings and discovery helped build a successful case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Early success can provide profile and opportunities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The Spycatcher case gave Turnbull enormous profile, enabling him to pursue other ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## [[networking_and_career_advice_for_university_students | Networking]] and Building Relationships
Turnbull emphasizes the importance of [[networking_and_career_advice_for_university_students | building relationships]] and leveraging opportunities to meet people:

*   **Journalism as a tool:** Being a journalist allows for meeting almost anyone, providing access to public figures and experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Ask questions:** The most flattering thing to say to someone is "explain something to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Always ask questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Seek out true experts:** When trying to understand a tricky issue, try to find the people who are actually doing the work, such as engineers, rather than just chief executives or chairmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Take notes:** Continuously take notes to retain information and insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Embrace serendipitous encounters:** Public transport can lead to unexpected meetings with people you wouldn't otherwise encounter, offering opportunities to learn something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.
*   **Initiate contact:** A simple smile and introduction are usually met with a positive response, initiating conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. Show interest in others, and they will share their stories and potentially helpful information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.

## [[reflections_on_education_and_careers | Career Decision Making]] and Skills for the Future
Turnbull's experience in hopping between highly successful careers offers specific [[career_decision_making | career decision making]] advice:

### Advice on Studying Law
Turnbull strongly advises against studying law unless one genuinely intends to practice it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. It is a professional degree, not a general intellectual endowment like a liberal arts degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. If one doesn't practice law, most of what is learned will be quickly forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

> "Don't do law, please do not do law unless you want to be a lawyer. Okay, if you want to be a lawyer, if you want to go to court and argue cases or you want to sit in a lawyer's office and write contracts and negotiate commercial transactions as a lawyer then do law. But a lot of kids do law because they think it's like a sort of general intellectual endowment, like a liberal arts degree. It's not, it is not, absolutely is not." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>

### Recommended Skills for Optionality
Given the rapid pace of change, Turnbull recommends acquiring skills that offer **optionality** and **agility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
*   **Good quantitative skills:** Numeracy is very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   **Digital skills:** Programming and coding are highly useful. Even if one doesn't become a coder, understanding the digital context is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   **Liberal arts and languages:** These subjects are helpful for developing intellectual discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   **Pursue passions:** Always study things you find interesting and have a passion for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

## Qualities for [[youth_empowerment_and_career_advice_for_people_in_their_20s | Success]] and [[lessons_and_advice_for_young_professionals_in_their_20s | Leadership]]
Reflecting on his journey, Turnbull highlights several personal qualities that contributed to his success:

*   **Determination and relentless focus:** When he focuses on a task, he does so relentlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Resilience:** He doesn't get disheartened easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Willingness to pivot:** After a significant achievement, he considered whether he wanted to spend the rest of his life doing the same thing or try something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   **Self-belief and ambition:** Believe in yourself, be ambitious, and be diligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. If you don't believe in yourself, no one else will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.
*   **Don't fear rejection:** Do not be easily discouraged by knock-backs or afraid to ask for things. "If you don't ask, you don't get" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. Applying for jobs and getting rejected is part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.
*   **Enjoy people:** Particularly in politics, but applicable broadly, genuinely enjoying other people's company and being interested in them is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

## Managing Stress and Well-being
Even in the demanding role of Prime Minister, Turnbull maintained a sense of self and managed stress effectively:

*   **Prioritize rest:** The "golden rule" in his office was "Don't kill the candidate" â€“ ensuring enough rest to avoid physical exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Being well-rested is essential for performing well in public-facing roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
*   **Good sleep habits:** He generally sleeps well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. Simple practices like not eating a big dinner contribute to a good night's sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.
*   **Stress management:** Being Prime Minister was stressful, but it never "got him down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

## General [[youth_empowerment_and_career_advice_for_people_in_their_20s | Advice for Young People]]

*   **Believe in yourself, be ambitious, be diligent, don't be down-hearted** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

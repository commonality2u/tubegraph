Building a business with a distribution-first model emphasizes the crucial role of [[the_impact_of_content_distribution_in_networking | distribution channels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. However, a common mistake in this approach is prioritizing vanity metrics like follower count or views over genuine trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## Commerce Follows Trust
The fundamental principle is that "commerce follows trust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Historically, trust was centralized among large organizations like Procter & Gamble or Johnson & Johnson, who controlled traditional media and built their commerce on that concentrated trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Today, trust is decentralizing, shifting into the hands of individual creators and figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

### The Misconception of Vanity Metrics
The size of a following, number of likes, or views do not inherently signify trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. A creator could have millions of followers, yet if the audience doesn't trust them, they might struggle to sell even a few t-shirts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The key mindset shift, therefore, is to focus on building trust rather than merely accumulating followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

## Building Trust Through Value
The most effective way to build trust is by creating value for people, often through education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. This means:
*   Making the audience smarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   Improving their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   Helping them make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   Generally making their lives a little bit better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

This value creation can be in small ways or deep dives, such as educating people about the economy or businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Examples of Trust-Based Distribution
*   **Pachy McCormack's "Not Boring" Newsletter:** This newsletter offers incredibly deep dives into businesses, attracting a niche audience that obsessively trusts his content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. While it may not reach tens of millions, the high value and trust make it highly monetizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **David Senra's "Founders" Podcast:** Senra reads hundreds of books on individuals to create "crazy deep dives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. His audience might not be as large as a mainstream celebrity's, but it includes CEOs of Fortune 100 organizations, indicating an immense amount of high-value trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

These examples highlight that sustained effort on difficult, intellectually rigorous content builds profound trust, which is superior to fleeting viral content that may generate views but not trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. People are willing to continue deploying energy on challenging content because they genuinely love it and it doesn't feel forced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. It's difficult to compete with someone so passionate that they would perform the same activity whether paid or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Strategic Focus on Unique Edge
For those just starting out, the advice is to identify a medium that is not heavily exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This often involves putting in incremental effort that leverages one's "unique edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Playing in a saturated space that doesn't leverage your unique strengths is counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

For instance, highly produced startup documentaries, which require significant time and rigor, have a much higher barrier to entry compared to standard podcast interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. While podcasts are easy to start, making them 10% better or securing 10% better guests for growth is challenging in a saturated market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Documentaries, by providing deep, insider access to private companies, offer higher value per minute and build a stronger foundation of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Once a large platform is built through such unique content, then diversifying into other formats like podcasts becomes more feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Peter Corbett, a partner at Deloitte Monitor and head of Monitor Deloitte in Sydney, emphasizes that [[corporate_strategy_and_its_importance_in_business | business strategy]] is now more important than ever, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Deloitte Monitor focuses on strategy consulting, which involves making choices to position an organization to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:0">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## The Shifting Landscape

COVID-19 has highlighted the critical need for organizations to re-evaluate their strategic choices and the underlying assumptions, as many of these assumptions no longer hold true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The ability for companies to rationalize their choices based on this changed set of assumptions is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

Peter Corbett highlights the concept of "winning" in strategy, stating that choices should not merely "kick the can down the road" but should lead to a compelling and victorious position against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. A key aspect of modern strategy is the shift towards purpose-driven rather than solely profit-driven aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

## Case Studies: Adapting to Change

The pandemic has forced diverse industries to rethink their core identity and how they serve customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

*   **Toilet Paper Manufacturers**: These saw a huge spike in demand early in the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Their strategic challenge now is how to encourage continued purchases when many households are overstocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Travel Companies and Gyms**: These sectors experienced a significant drop in demand for their physical services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
    *   Gyms responded by offering online classes to maintain memberships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
    *   Travel companies, such as Qantas, engaged in unusual activities like selling off wines and old equipment, and storing planes in deserts, reflecting strategic choices driven by new future assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Implications for the TMT Industry

The Telco, Media, and Tech (TMT) industry has seen a rapid convergence of mega trends during COVID-19, including artificial intelligence, advanced wireless networks (5G, Wi-Fi 6), and cloud technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.

*   **Telcos**: The pandemic has questioned traditional advantages for telcos, which have faced consistent margin squeeze for the last decade due to cheaper data and optimized customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. However, it has also created new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.
    *   **Future Scenarios**: Research into telco scenarios post-pandemic identified two critical uncertainties: their ability to monetize infrastructure (fiber, mobile networks) and the rate of customer shift to digital interactions (e.g., telehealth, online education) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.
    *   **Strategic Flexibility**: These uncertainties create diverse opportunity sets. Telcos might seize opportunities by offering new services (e.g., virtual health, education) and monetizing them, or they might need to [[economic_downturns_and_strategies_to_weather_them | bunker down]], cut costs, and focus on being a lower-cost provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.
    *   **Economic Impact**: The health statistics related to COVID-19 are directly linked to [[economic_downturns_and_strategies_to_weather_them | economic environments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.

## Key Strategic Considerations

To develop a resilient strategy in uncertain times, companies must bake "future thinking" and "scenario thinking" into their choice-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This involves:

*   **Identifying "Must-Do" vs. "Optional" Actions**: Given different future scenarios, discern which strategic options are essential and which can be pursued conditionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
*   **Design Thinking**: Influenced by design thinking, the approach to strategic options involves exploring divergent possibilities and then converging on what is feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.
*   **"What Would Need to Be True?"**: This framing question helps clients assess the viability of strategic options across dimensions like customer, channel, competition, finance, and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. It identifies areas where more information or "war gaming" (e.g., competitor reactions) might be needed to gain confidence in choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
*   **Democratizing Strategy**: Strategy should not be confined to an "ivory tower" of senior executives but should be discussed and challenged throughout the organization to improve decision-making and foster a more effective work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. [[corporate_strategy_and_its_importance_in_business | Strategy without execution is not strategy at all]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

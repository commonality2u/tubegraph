Tim Fung, an "entrepreneurial legend in Sydney," is the founder of [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]], a prominent marketplace for outsourcing jobs and tasks that has grown into a "remarkably big and impactful company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This article explores Fung's entrepreneurial journey, his insights on the Australian startup ecosystem, and the character traits that contributed to his success.

## Early Career and Entrepreneurial Spark
Before founding [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]], Tim Fung studied a Bachelor of Commerce at UNSW and spent four years in real estate investment banking at Macquarie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

A memorable moment that hinted at his future entrepreneurial path occurred at Macquarie. While thirsty, Fung used a clean peanut butter jar to drink water, as no glasses were available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. A director found this "insane," but Fung saw it as a "fit for purpose solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This incident, along with other "fungisms" (musings that colleagues found "crazy" but he saw as logical), made him realize that large corporations could be "in the box" in their thinking and that he might need "something more out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

Despite this, Fung cherished his time at Macquarie, describing it as "awesome" and a "super high performance culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Many [[lessons_from_scaling_and_entrepreneurship | lessons learned]] there were applicable to [[identifying_and_hiring_talent_in_startups | building a high-performance team]] at Airtasker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. His entrepreneurial tendencies, he believes, stem from a dissatisfaction with the world and a natural inclination to think about solutions to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. His father was also a significant mentor who encouraged practical thinking and never "put a dampener" on his ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## The Genesis of Airtasker
The idea for [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]] sparked from a personal experience: Fung was moving apartments and asked a friend with a truck for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This led to the realization that many people ask friends for help with tasks, while others would "love to earn a living by doing this kind of work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This initial conversation evolved over weeks and months of discussions with friends, culminating in the launch of the website and app eight months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

Fung and his co-founder, Jono, were actively seeking to start a company prior to [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. An earlier venture, an "interactive outdoor marketing" platform, taught Fung a crucial [[lessons_from_scaling_and_entrepreneurship | lesson]]: the importance of deeply believing in the value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. With [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]], the value was "really obvious": connecting people who need work done with those who want to earn extra money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This clear, "synthesizable and understandable at like a human level" value fueled his determination to push through difficulties, even when others viewed the idea as a "joke and a bit of a hobby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Evolution of Execution and Scaling
The nature of execution changes significantly as a company scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
Initially, it requires:
*   **Courage and Naivety:** The courage to "put yourself out there" and try something new, combined with the naivety to believe it will succeed despite potential failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Skill Development:** Developing skills in areas like software engineering, marketing, or capital raising, or [[identifying_and_hiring_talent_in_startups | hiring people]] who possess these capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

As [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]] grew to roughly 175 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, the third phase of execution emerged:
*   **Empowering Others:** Becoming "less selfish" and empowering others to do good work, allowing them to "get all the glory" for achievements like marketing campaigns or capital raises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. This shift from being the "hacker" to a CEO who creates a platform for others to shine is challenging but crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

Fung highlights that the stereotypical startup playbook, often geared towards SaaS companies, doesn't apply to marketplaces like [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. For a consumer company built on user-generated content, scale *is* the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Just as a telephone or Facebook requires a network to be valuable, [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]] needed immediate scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Therefore, early efforts focused on "hacking growth" and experimentation rather than solely product or engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Today, [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]] is more product-centric, utilizing data science and machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

## Challenges of Scaling and Entrepreneurship
Tim Fung hasn't felt like "quitting," but there have been moments of extreme stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. To manage this, he consciously changes his physical mindset, sometimes by smiling when stress is high, which helps him shift out of a fearful state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

The hardest [[challenges_of_scaling_and_pivoting_startups | challenges]] have been:
*   **Capital:** Running out of money is a "harrowing experience" for founders, as they are responsible for employee salaries and operational costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.
*   **People Issues:** Firing someone for the first time or conducting restructures that impact individuals are "absolute hardest things" that genuinely cause sleepless nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.

## The Australian Startup Ecosystem
When [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]] started in 2012, the Australian startup ecosystem was nascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. Companies like Atlassian were much smaller, and there was no [[impact_of_canva_on_the_australian_startup_ecosystem | Canva]], SafetyCulture, or established VCs like Blackbird, Square Peg, or AirTree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. Fung even had to start his own co-working space due to lack of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

Over time, the ecosystem has "really, really improved," with a "fairly healthy" environment for angel, seed, and Series A funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. However, later-stage funding can still be limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. Raising money from overseas investors was particularly difficult for [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]] because it started as an Australian-only model, and U.S. investors prefer to invest in products they can personally understand or use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.

Fung believes that the "micro is way more important than the macro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. One doesn't need to be in Silicon Valley to build a successful startup; if you're the "best startup in Sydney," you can succeed there, as demonstrated by companies like [[impact_of_canva_on_the_australian_startup_ecosystem | Canva]] and SafetyCulture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.

## Key Lessons and Mindset
Tim Fung shares valuable [[lessons_from_scaling_and_entrepreneurship | lessons]] that guide his approach:
*   **Curiosity over Judgment:** Inspired by the book *Change Your Questions, Change Your Life*, Fung emphasizes approaching situations and people with a "curious position rather than a judgmental position" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. This encourages discovery rather than reinforcing preconceived notions.
*   **Embrace Ambiguity:** Drawing from Annie Duke's *Thinking in Bets*, Fung stresses the importance of dealing with ambiguity as a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. He argues that trying to simplify life with things like precise revenue forecasts (which are often "a bunch of numbers on a page") doesn't genuinely impact business operations and can create a false sense of security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. "I don't know" can often be the right answer in uncertain situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.
*   **Fast and Slow Thinking:** Referencing *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, Fung highlights the value of recognizing when to use fast, intuitive thinking and when to slow down and engage the logical part of the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.
*   **Ruthless High Performance:** He admires Michael Schumacher for his ability to build a caring, respected team while simultaneously setting an "incredibly high performance bar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.
*   **Resilience and Rejection:** A key piece of advice for university students is to "get ready to kiss a lot of frogs," meaning to prepare for the reality that "95% of people are not going to come with you on that journey and not going to be supportive of your ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. Building resilience to punch through rejection is powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>.

## Technology Trends and The Gig Economy
Fung doesn't point to a single tech theme he's "super excited about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. Instead, he observes two significant trends:
*   **Consolidation of SaaS Services:** There's a proliferation of subscription (SaaS) companies for every part of the supply chain, leading to high costs and inconvenient integrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>. He anticipates consolidation in this space, with major players like Google and Microsoft integrating more services due to inherent "bolt-on convenience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.
*   **Peer-to-Peer Marketplaces (Sharing Economy):** The "sharing economy," featuring companies like Airbnb, Etsy, and [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]], represents one of the most powerful uses of the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. It enables greater efficiency in resource allocation by connecting people directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.

### COVID-19 Impact on Airtasker
COVID-19 had a "two-directional impact" on [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. While stage three and four restrictions caused a dip in activity because people couldn't leave their homes to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>, it also "accelerated our bounce back," leading to faster growth in 2020 than in prior years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.

[[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]] is unique as an "infinitely horizontal marketplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Unlike verticalized platforms like Uber (which focuses on driving), [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]]'s model, built on user-generated content, allowed demand to "seamlessly moved around" during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>. For example, while cleaning tasks dropped, bicycle repairs and home office setup increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. This flexibility makes the platform "malleable" to changing situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.

### The "Gig Economy" and Inequality
Fung prefers not to use the umbrella term "gig economy" as it's misleading, similar to generalizing all "permanent full-time jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>. He distinguishes between platforms that commoditize work and drive down labor costs (where price and work type are defined by the platform) and [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]]'s model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>.

On [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]], the scope and price of work are defined by the community (customer or tasker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>. Fung views [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]] as a platform that creates flexibility and allows people to "monetize whatever skill that they have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>. Notably, the platform sees a "price premium" where taskers can charge more, not a "race to the bottom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. The average difference between the customer's desired price and the tasker's final earning is around 20% and is expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>. In fact, a top tasker on [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]] earned $297,000 in a year through jobs like painting and moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>.

Fung likens [[Building a successful tech startup | Airtasker]]'s approach to company management: instead of micromanaging, they set a mission and goals, incentivize performance, and empower smart individuals to "go out and do it for yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

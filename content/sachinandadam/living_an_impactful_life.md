The concept of [[living_an_impactful_life | living an impactful life]] is a foundational principle for The Sachin Adam Show podcast. Alongside curiosity, it stands as one of the two strong beliefs held by the hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Core Philosophy of The Sachin Adam Show

The podcast was initiated from a belief that there are many "amazing people in the world to learn from" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The hosts contend that valuable lessons can be gained even from casual interactions, such as over a cup of coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. A key tenet is that "if you're open to learning and really to work hard then the sky's the limit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, suggesting that dedication and openness to [[personal_growth_and_work_life_balance | personal growth]] are crucial for achieving an impactful existence.

## Host Perspectives on Impact

Both hosts, Sachin and Adam, share personal passions that align with the theme of impact:
*   **Sachin** is a 21-year-old university student with an obsession for social enterprise, fitness, and the philosophy of seeking discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. His interest in social enterprise directly reflects a desire to create positive change.
*   **Adam**, also a 21-year-old university student studying economics, philosophy, and finance, is "super curious about a bunch of things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. His primary passion lies at the "intersection of business and social impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, highlighting a focus on using professional avenues for broader societal benefit.

## The Journey of Self-Discovery

The hosts acknowledge that nobody has "life figured out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. They are both on their "own life and journeys of self-discovery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> and are actively "finding our place in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This ongoing process of [[personal_growth_and_work_life_balance | self-discovery]] is an integral part of understanding how to effectively live an impactful life.

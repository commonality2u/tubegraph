[[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | Web3]] crypto gaming has seen significant growth and investment, with companies like Immutable X leading the charge in transforming the gaming industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Immutable X: A Pioneer in Web3 Gaming
Immutable X, co-founded by Robbie Ferguson and his brother James, is a prominent player in the [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | web3]] gaming space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. At just 25, Robbie Ferguson, alongside his brother, built Immutable X into a billion-dollar company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It quickly became one of the fastest companies in [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_australian_tech_ecosystem | Australia]] to achieve a billion-dollar valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, currently valued at $2.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, and recently raised $200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Robbie Fergusonâ€™s core driver is to incrementally help the world move towards a post-economic scarcity, utopian civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. He views [[the_rise_of_cryptocurrency_and_decentralized_finance_defi | crypto]] as a major lever for achieving this, through the creation of new incentive structures for the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### What is Immutable X?
Immutable X is a platform designed to enable easy creation of [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | web3]] games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. The long-term vision extends beyond gaming, but this remains the core focus, as it's expected to bring the next 100 million to a billion users to [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | web3]] and generate trillions of dollars in true digital property rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

The platform provides:
*   **ZK roll-up scaling engine for NFTs:** Developed in partnership with StarkWare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Easy-to-use APIs:** Designed for businesses to build on [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | web3]] with extreme simplicity, similar to launching a website or mobile game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This contrasts with other platforms requiring smart contracts or proprietary languages like Rust or Cadence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Immutable Studios:** Develops two internal games and publishes more, led by Justin Hulog from Riot Games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The goal is to create meaningful [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | web3]] games where players have actual property rights, can sell items, own them, and benefit from finite scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

This approach aims to fix the broken relationship between game creators and players, aligning their long-term incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Why Gaming for Web3 Adoption?
Gaming is seen as the most obvious area for [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | web3]] transformation due to existing player spending habits and the inherent issues with current digital property ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

*   **Existing Market:** Gamers spend $100 billion annually on in-game items like skins and coins, which they do not truly own or have the right to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **Exploitation by Centralized Platforms:** Players frequently face situations where their digital assets lose value or become unusable due to decisions by game developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Examples include Diablo and Counter-Strike GO, where items worth hundreds of millions of dollars were lost or restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **True Property Rights:** [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | Web3]] proposes that intangible digital items should have property rights, similar to physical possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. As the world becomes increasingly digital, with people spending more time in augmented or virtual realities, ensuring ownership in these digital universes is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

## The Transformative Power of NFTs in Gaming
NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) revolutionize gaming by allowing players to own in-game assets as true digital property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### Commercial Incentives Shift
[[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | Web3]] changes the commercial incentives for game creators. Instead of deprecating old content to encourage new purchases, companies can profit from secondary market transactions, aligning their success with the growth of their game's economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
*   **Magic the Gathering Arena Example:** If a game like Magic the Gathering could take secondary clips on card trading, their business model would align with players. Their job would be to grow the economy's value, create new complexities, and ensure old cards remain valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.
*   **User and Creator Ownership:** [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | Web3]] allows users and creators to own 100% of profits, making the most successful games those that give the most value back to players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
    *   **Illuvium:** Built on Immutable X, Illuvium achieved a record $72 million USD in sales in a weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. 100% of the revenue from Illuvium sales goes to every token holder, showcasing a new model of shared ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

### Addressing Concerns: Cost and Focus on Value
Critics suggest that integrating NFTs might make games more expensive or shift the focus from enjoyment to monetary gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **Accessibility:** [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | Web3]] doesn't dictate game cost but changes the commercial incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. The goal is still to make games accessible and provide value to players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **Free-to-Play Evolution:** The gaming industry has evolved from paid games to free-to-play models monetized by in-game transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | Web3]] extends this by incentivizing users with value, not just cheaper transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. This includes backing economies where players receive assets for playing or sharing the game, increasing viral coefficients and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

## Current State and Future Outlook of Web3 Gaming
The [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | web3]] gaming space has experienced challenges, including skepticism due to market crashes and fraudulent projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. However, there's strong belief in its long-term inevitability.

### Inevitability of Web3
*   **Superior Trading Standard:** NFTs offer a superior standard for trading assets due to their liquidity and utility premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.
*   **Integration with [[the_rise_of_cryptocurrency_and_decentralized_finance_defi | Decentralized Finance (DeFi)]]:** NFTs can instantly and permissionlessly tap into [[the_rise_of_cryptocurrency_and_decentralized_finance_defi | DeFi]] services, creating new financial opportunities for tokenized assets beyond gaming, including real estate, intellectual property, and financial instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
*   **Capital and Talent Inflow:** The industry is seeing enormous and sustained investment from VCs, with [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | web3]] gaming receiving over $8.5 billion in funding in 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Top talent from companies like Meta and AAA gaming studios are also pouring into [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | web3]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

### Addressing Challenges
*   **Market Volatility and Scams:** Similar to the dot-com bubble, the influx of capital leads to scams and poorly incentivized projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. Immutable's focus is on building utility-driven NFT volume, where assets are traded for in-game use, not just speculative luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. For example, average trade price for Gods Unchained items is around one dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
*   **User Experience and Onboarding:** Currently, user onboarding for [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | web3]] games can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. The ideal future is for players to experience the value of [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | web3]] without necessarily knowing the underlying technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. Games like Aglet and content from brands like Disney are building on Immutable X by abstracting away much of the [[the_rise_of_cryptocurrency_and_decentralized_finance_defi | crypto]] complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.
*   **Gaming Supply Constraints:** The supply side of quality [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | web3]] games has been limited, leading to an abundance of profile picture projects over meaningful games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. This supply is expected to come online over the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

### Ethereum's Merge and Scaling Solutions
The Ethereum merge will improve Ethereum's security and make it deflationary and carbon-efficient, but it will not significantly impact scaling for NFT transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. Ethereum's scale will remain limited, supporting only about 5 NFT transactions per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

To address this, Immutable is building a cross-roll-up liquidity platform, enabling hundreds of Layer 2 (L2) and Layer 3 (L3) solutions to connect with no loss of liquidity, user funds, or security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>. This allows for massive scale without having to bootstrap new ecosystems from scratch, which is crucial for the future of [[evolution_of_the_internet_from_web1_to_web3 | web3]] gaming and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. This aligns with Vitalik Buterin's focus on solving cross-roll-up liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.

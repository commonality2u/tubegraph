Emil Michael, former Chief Business Officer at Uber, emphasizes an honest and transparent approach to [[fundraising_and_business_growth_strategies | fundraising]]. He describes his method as straightforward, aiming to close deals effectively rather than playing games with investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Emil Michael's Honest Approach

When approaching investors, Michael states he would honestly communicate the desired amount of money to raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. When asked about the valuation, his reply was consistently "whatever the market decides" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He explicitly told investors he was "dead serious" and telling them the truth, planning to speak with many investors and ask for bids from all of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

His strategy involved not necessarily taking the absolute best bid, but often the second-best, to ensure the deal would close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. He also aimed to be slightly oversubscribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>. Crucially, he committed to giving almost every party their full allocation, avoiding common tactics of cutting back investor commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>. This transparent and predictable process, where he did "exactly what I said" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:25">[00:44:25]</a>, built trust with investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.

> "I am dead serious I'm telling you the truth now I'm not just going to talk to you I'm going to talk to a lot of investors and I'm going to ask them all for bids and I'm not going to take the best one or I take the second best one because I want to make sure the deal closes." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>

## Fundraising at Uber

As Chief Business Officer at Uber, Emil Michael was described as a "Master negotiator" who raised billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Initially, the CEO, Travis, didn't think he needed help with fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. However, Michael proved very effective in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

The fundraising for Uber occurred during the "free money era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>, and the company had an "incredible" product-market fit from day one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. A significant advantage was that almost every investor used Uber's product, statistically increasing the likelihood of investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

Despite these advantages, the process was challenging due to the unprecedented sums being raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Uber conducted six rounds of financing in 20 months, growing from a valuation of $350 million to $70 billion in 24-30 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. This intense pace occurred while Michael was also running the China business, building the enterprise business, and handling various other challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

## Avoiding the "FOMO Game"

Michael advises entrepreneurs today, especially given the current difficulties in private tech markets, against playing the "fomo game" (fear of missing out) with investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. He views it as a "game" where one can win or lose, preferring an honest and direct approach instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

His experience in [[fundraising_and_business_growth_strategies | fundraising]] for Uber informed his belief that a transparent process where agreed-upon terms are met and deadlines are respected is a superior strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. He advocates for a clear, refined, and transparent process that sets expectations and builds trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

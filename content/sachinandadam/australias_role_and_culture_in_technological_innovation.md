Australia possesses a unique position in the global technological landscape, particularly within the quantum computing field, where it has been at the forefront since the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>. However, to further solidify its status as a technological superpower, certain cultural shifts and approaches to [[innovation_in_australian_technology | innovation]] are suggested.

## Key Figures in Australian Technology

Michelle Simmons, a leading Australian Quantum physicist and former Australian of the Year, is recognized for her foundational contributions to atomic electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. She founded Silicon Quantum Computing, which has successfully raised over $100 million to build a quantum computer in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This initiative demonstrates Australia's capability in cutting-edge technological development.

## Cultural Aspects Influencing Australian Innovation

The [[australias_path_to_becoming_a_tech_superpower | path to becoming a tech superpower]] for Australia involves addressing cultural norms and educational approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.

### The "Dumbing Down" Trend

There has been a trend in Australian education, from schools to universities, of "dumbing down" what people need to learn by making courses easier and aiming for higher grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. This approach is seen as counterproductive because the real world is not easy or "cushy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.

Bright young Australians are perceived to be "starved of challenges" within the current system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>. Taking on challenges and risks is critical for achieving significant goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>.

### Embracing Failure and Building Resilience

Similar to sentiments expressed by Malcolm Turnbull, Australia needs to embrace failure and take on more risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. By offering harder challenges, young people will inevitably fail more, which is crucial for developing resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. In highly complex fields like quantum computing manufacturing, initial success rates can be as low as 10%, requiring immense resilience to keep going <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

### Need for Self-Validation and Unique Approaches

A significant cultural issue is the tendency of Australians not to back themselves, constantly seeking validation from other countries, such as the US or UK, before progressing their own methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. This contrasts with Australia's unique approaches to technology that others haven't pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.

> "Why don't we just do what we intrinsically do well and just focus on it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>

An example of Australia's unique approach is the investment model for Silicon Quantum Computing, which received funding from Commonwealth and state governments, banks like Telstra, and universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. This multi-sector backing is an advantage Australia possesses that other countries may not, which should be leveraged instead of adhering to models like the US venture capital system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>.

### Understanding Complex Technologies

There's a misconception that complex fields like quantum computing are too difficult to understand and therefore rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:54">[00:46:54]</a>. This contributes to a cultural barrier where people deem things hard and abstract instead of attempting to comprehend them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>. Promoting STEM subjects and fostering a culture where a significant portion of the population has a technical background, similar to countries like India, could foster a more robust [[innovation_in_australian_technology | innovation]] culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

## Australia's Strategic Position in Technology

Having a sovereign capability in manufacturing is crucial for Australia to control its technological future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>. Manufacturing, even for high-value, low-volume products like quantum computers, can thrive in Australia despite its remote location, especially when the products can be accessed globally via the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. This "Swiss watch style" of high-quality manufacturing is an ideal position for Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

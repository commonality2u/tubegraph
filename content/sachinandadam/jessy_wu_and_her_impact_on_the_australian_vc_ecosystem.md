Jesse Wu is recognized as a prominent and emerging figure within the [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_australian_tech_ecosystem | Australian startup ecosystem]] and [[venture_capital_insights_with_sam_wong | VC]] landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:42">[01:42:42]</a>. Known for her strong personal brand, vocal presence, and often contrary views, she has significantly influenced discussions around branding and investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>.

## Personal Journey and Core Drivers

Born in Shenzhen, China – often referred to as the [[differences_between_australian_and_silicon_valley_startup_cultures | Silicon Valley]] of China and home to Tencent – Jesse lived there until she was six years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. She enjoyed creating stories, which her grandfather would write down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. At seven, her family immigrated to New Zealand, where she faced the challenge of learning English, initially knowing only a few multi-syllabic words like "tomorrow" and "butterfly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

This early experience profoundly shaped her understanding of the power of words and voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. She went on to study English and Philosophy at university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Her core drive is linked to the belief that having a voice enables one to influence the world and empower others, especially those traditionally sidelined or marginalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

Her background as a migrant led her to feel like an "outsider" and made her cognizant of social hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. This awareness of power structures likely influences her willingness to challenge existing hierarchies in the [[venture_capital_insights_with_sam_wong | VC]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. She applies a "tug of war rope" analogy to public engagement, choosing to challenge those who hold significant power and influence ("punching up") rather than those who misstep or are just starting out ("punching down") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. As her own influence has grown, she has become more considered in her public commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.

## Branding Philosophy

Jesse emphasizes "resonance" in branding, both for herself and for Afterwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. This concept, derived from piano keys vibrating at the same frequency, suggests tuning into one's unique "frequency" and trusting that the right audience will connect with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>. Signs of finding this frequency include entering a "flow state" in writing or speaking where words flow naturally, and recognizing authenticity in one's own work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. A key aspect is treating the audience with intellectual respect, akin to the approach of the "Acquired podcast," by not "bullshitting them" or dumbing down content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>. She also believes in weaning oneself off "dominant discourses" to cultivate genuinely independent ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>.

## Afterwork's Investment Strategy

As part of the full-time team at Afterwork, Jesse has helped shape its unique investment model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:27:00">[30:27:00]</a>. Afterwork started as a community-powered fund in March 2021, initially a "Motley Crew of about 25 people" who collectively supported startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:30:00">[29:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:42:00">[29:42:00]</a>. They provide founders with a "Rolodex" of community members offering expertise in areas like growth marketing or financial modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:53:00">[29:53:00]</a>.

Afterwork has since raised a professional fund of over $20 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:25:00">[30:25:00]</a>. Their strategy is based on two core beliefs:
1.  **High Conviction Requires a Time Series:** Afterwork's initial checks are relatively small (AUD 100K-400K), with plans to make 40-50 such investments from their first fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:20:00">[32:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:31:00">[32:31:00]</a>. These smaller investments allow them to build a relationship with founders over a 12-month period, gaining a "360-degree view" of their engagement, problem-solving abilities, and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:55:00">[30:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>. This contrasts with a quick due diligence process, as it's harder for founders to "pretend to be someone they're not" over a longer period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>. Their larger follow-on checks (AUD 1M-1.5M) are made with this deeper conviction, often representing nearly 10% of the fund in one company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:34:00">[33:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:39:00">[33:39:00]</a>.
2.  **Valuation Discipline:** Jesse stresses the importance of valuation discipline at every investment stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:09:00">[35:09:00]</a>. While not being "sticklers" for minor differences, they will pass on deals if the valuation is too high relative to the stage, understanding that lower entry valuations lead to higher multiples on return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:37:00">[35:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:47:00">[35:47:00]</a>.

For initial investments where conviction is still building, Afterwork looks for "organizational discipline" in founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:18:00">[36:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:42:00">[36:42:00]</a>. This includes how founders master the moving components of their business and run their fundraising process like an "Enterprise sales process" – with quick follow-ups, detailed responses, and simultaneous engagement with multiple funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:52:00">[36:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:11:00">[37:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:46:00">[37:46:00]</a>. This indicates whether they can "run a tight ship," crucial for progressing from pre-seed to seed stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>.

## Views on the Australian VC Landscape

Jesse provides insights into the dynamics of the [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_australian_venture_capital_landscape | Australian Venture Capital landscape]], particularly concerning fund sizes:
*   **Small vs. Large Funds:** With smaller amounts of capital (e.g., $1 million), she suggests optimizing for "multiples rather than absolute returns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>. This means steering clear of very large funds (those with nearly a billion dollars under management) because larger funds typically see compressed multiples due to the sheer volume of wealth creation required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>.
*   **Risk and Opportunity:** Large funds often make "bets in outliers" aiming for multi-billion-dollar companies, which entails high execution risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>. This strategy, while potentially yielding massive returns from a single success, means they miss opportunities in companies with feasible, but capped, outcomes (e.g., $500 million) that might be very attractive to smaller, specialized funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>.
*   **Recommended Investments:** If given $1 million to invest in [[investing_in_australian_tech_startups | Australia]], she would allocate half to EVP, a B2B SaaS-focused investor known for its discipline and expertise in tracking product-market fit signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>. EVP explicitly questions the "power law" tenet of [[venture_capital_insights_with_sam_wong | VC]], focusing instead on companies with clear paths to $500 million or $1 billion valuations that can still provide a "hundred X" return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>. The other half would go to Coventures, a $5 million pre-seed fund led by Maxine Minter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>. Coventures targets [[investing_in_australian_tech_startups | Australian founders]] building global businesses not typically favored by [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_australian_venture_capital_landscape | Australian investors]] (e.g., consumer, hardware, health tech), aiming to bridge them to U.S. funding partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>.

### Role of Large Funds

Jesse believes large funds, such as Blackbird, Square Peg, and Airtree, act as "market makers for big ambition" in Australia and New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:44:00">[26:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>. By offering a large pot of capital for ambitious founders and proactively promoting the [[impact_of_the_startup_ecosystem in Australia | Australian startup ecosystem]], they incentivize talented individuals to build their careers locally, fostering a environment that produces more companies and potentially allows for the deployment of their large funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:00">[25:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:00">[28:07:00]</a>.

## VC Role and Founder Storytelling

Jesse defines the value a [[venture_capital_insights_with_sam_wong | VC]] brings as having a "bird's eye view" across many companies, allowing them to apply general market insights to specific cases and identify common pitfalls ("where the bodies in the idea maze might lie") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:25:00">[48:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:09:00">[49:09:00]</a>. She states that [[venture_capital_insights_with_sam_wong | investors]] are not meant to be mentors or operators within a company but rather "coaches" – sounding boards that help founders find their own solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:02:00">[51:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:10:00">[51:10:00]</a>.

While acknowledging the importance of storytelling for CEOs in functions like fundraising, hiring, and motivating teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:06:00">[40:06:00]</a>, Jesse cautions against over-indexing on how a founder's story "makes you feel" in early meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:50:00">[40:50:00]</a>. This "systems one thinking" (intuitive, emotional response) can be dangerous as stories can "gloss over gaping plot holes" or "misdirect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:04:00">[41:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:46:00">[41:46:00]</a>. She stresses the importance of engaging "systems two thinking" (effortful, logical reasoning) by asking questions that test the coherence of a business, such as unit economics and path to profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:26:00">[42:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:54:00">[42:54:00]</a>. To be a contrarian investor, especially at early stages, it's crucial to consult subject matter experts and focus on whether a genuine, unsolved problem exists, rather than relying solely on charismatic narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:00">[44:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:09:00">[45:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:32:00">[46:32:00]</a>.

Cam Adams, co-founder of Canva, offers [[advice_on_entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | valuable advice]] for young Australian founders, emphasizing a global mindset and the power of technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:20">[03:55:20]</a>. This [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_advice | guidance]] stems from Canva's own journey and its inherent DNA of impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>.

## Think Big and Beyond Borders
Adams stresses the importance of thinking broadly, beyond national boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:30">[04:07:30]</a>. For Canva, Australia was considered a later market, perhaps the fourth or fifth, when planning their launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:90">[04:13:90]</a>.

## Tackle World Problems
Entrepreneurs should aim to solve "world problems" â€“ challenges that are truly global and can be world-changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:60">[04:27:60]</a>. This approach naturally expands the potential audience to billions, rather than limiting it to a country's population of 20 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

## Leverage Technology to Overcome Geographical Constraints
With modern technology, geographical constraints are no longer an obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:20">[04:22:20]</a>. This enables founders to pursue global challenges and reach a wider audience from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:60">[04:27:60]</a>.

### Canva's Ethos of Giving Back
Canva was founded with a vision to be an organization that looks beyond just the bottom line and shareholder value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:20">[01:41:20]</a>. The company aims to provide value to everyone involved, from investors and customers to those indirectly affected by its choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This foundational principle naturally incorporates considerations for the planet and social equity and justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:70">[01:59:70]</a>.

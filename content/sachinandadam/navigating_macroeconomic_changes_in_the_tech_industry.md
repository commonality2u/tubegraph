Ben Thompson, CEO and founder of Employment Hero, a billion-dollar software company based in [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_australian_tech_ecosystem | Australia]], has shared insights into navigating the [[economic_downturns_and_strategies_to_weather_them | tough macro environment]] that began impacting the [[the_future_of_tech_jobs_and_startup_funding | tech market]] in mid-2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Employment Hero specializes in HR and payroll software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Strategy During Economic Turmoil

Facing significant "gyrations" in the [[the_future_of_tech_jobs_and_startup_funding | tech market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> and changes in the [[navigating_venture_capital_and_startup_ecosystems | funding environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, Employment Hero adopted a strategy of hyper-sensitivity to unit economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This focus was established years prior, with John Henderson from Airtree emphasizing tight unit economics since their Series A and B rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This proactive approach placed them in a strong position when the market shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

Despite higher interest rates compared to a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, Employment Hero has maintained exceptional net revenue retention and strong growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The consistently low unemployment rate, hovering between 3.5% and 3.7%, has paradoxically benefited the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. A tight employment market means businesses are constantly seeking solutions for recruitment, a major problem for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, allowing Employment Hero to expand "upstream into the recruitment market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## The Role of Remote Work in Economic Adaptation

Ben Thompson is a strong advocate for [[trends_in_technology_and_gig_economy | remote work]], seeing it as a crucial component for business resilience and societal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Employment Hero transitioned to a remote-first model at the start of COVID-19, a strategic move outlined in their "Master Plan Part Two" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Benefits of Remote Work

*   **Flexibility and Inclusivity**: [[trends_in_technology_and_gig_economy | Remote work]] provides flexibility for working parents, individuals with disabilities, and pet carers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Geographic Mobility**: It empowers individuals in rural communities to access high-powered, high-paid jobs without relocating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Global Access to Talent**: For companies, it broadens the recruitment pool beyond a limited local radius, allowing access to a worldwide [[investment_in_technology_and_emerging_markets | talent pool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This is particularly relevant as technologies like Starlink connect billions more people to the internet, integrating [[emerging_middle_class_in_asia_and_tech_economy | developing countries]] into the global workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Thompson believes this will allow billions to "live better lives, earn more money in better ways legally and constructively contribute to society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, showcasing the [[social_impact_and_innovation_in_emerging_technologies | social good]] of remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Creativity**: Solitude often fosters deeper, more considered thought, leading to better ideas than traditional brainstorming sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

### Challenges of a Global Workforce and Employment Hero's Solution

Building a global workforce presents complexities such as varying legal frameworks for employment, public holidays, long service leave, workers' compensation, time zones, language barriers, and cultural differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

Employment Hero developed its "Global Teams" business specifically to address these challenges for Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The platform establishes employment entities globally, incorporates legal minimum entitlements into its system, organizes payroll services, and manages recruitment in various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. The goal is to make it as easy to employ someone anywhere on Earth as it is in one's local town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

### Fostering Culture in a Remote-First Environment

With 825 employees globally, most of Employment Hero's culture has been developed remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. Key strategies include:
*   **Asynchronous Communication**: Enabling team members to respond when it makes sense for them, leading to more considered responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
*   **Clear Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**: Providing autonomy and trust while ensuring alignment with company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Technology**: Tools for real-time transcription and translation in multiple languages are breaking down cultural barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.
*   **Global Gatherings**: To maintain social connections and camaraderie, Employment Hero organizes annual "Global Gatherings" â€“ all-expenses-paid trips to international locations for all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. These deliberate efforts are seen as building stronger teams and collaborative environments more effectively than daily office attendance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.
*   **Inherent Diversity**: A global remote-first workforce naturally fosters exceptional diversity in culture, religion, race, language, and gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.

## Future Vision and Products

Employment Hero's "Master Plan Part Three" aims to expand beyond traditional HR and payroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The ultimate objective is to become "the world's largest platform for managing human beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

### Swag: The Employment Super App
Swag is Employment Hero's first consumer-facing app, designed to empower employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. Leveraging the "formidable buying power" of over a million people (approximately 15% of [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_australian_tech_ecosystem | Australia's]] private sector workforce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>, Swag aims to combat the cost of living crisis and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.

Key features of Swag include:
*   **Instapay**: Providing employees real-time access to their earned wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>, with a vision for hourly direct payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.
*   **Discounts and Benefits**: Leveraging collective buying power for employee advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.
*   **Integrated Employment Management**: A single app for finding work, managing shifts, getting paid, and managing savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.
*   **Dynamic CVs**: Automatically updating an employee's profile with hours worked and roles held, providing a continuously current CV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.

This "employment super app" creates a strong value proposition for candidates and employees, which in turn helps solve employers' biggest problem: finding talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>.

### Proactive Talent Sourcing
Employment Hero is proactively recruiting talent from locations like the Philippines to provide various skill sets to Australian customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. Their ambition is to supply talent for "every role" that currently exists on their platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.

### International Expansion
The company is aggressively expanding into the UK market, believing they have "secret weapons" to succeed despite the competitive landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Employment Hero has already released AI features and is actively developing "Horizon 2 Horizon 3" features that are months to a year from release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

Ben Thompson's strategic thinking emphasizes simplifying the complexities of employment for businesses, allowing them to focus on their core strengths while Employment Hero handles the vital task of sourcing, managing, and empowering a global workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.

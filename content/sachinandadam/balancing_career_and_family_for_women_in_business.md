Alicia McDonald, a partner at AirTree Ventures, one of Australia's largest venture capital funds, embodies the complex challenge of [[balancing_career_goals_with_personal_life_and_family | balancing a demanding career with a rich personal life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. Despite a high-intensity role, she manages to navigate life as a VC partner and a mother of three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

## A Definition of Success Beyond Winning
McDonald believes that success is not about winning while leaving "a trail of destruction, broken relationships, broken trust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead, she finds satisfaction in achieving shared wins, working alongside founders and colleagues to accomplish collective goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This approach ensures that personal impact and collaboration are prioritized alongside professional achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

## Dispelling Misconceptions
A common misconception about senior roles in the venture capital industry is that individuals must dedicate their entire lives to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. However, McDonald stresses the importance of having a full life outside of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. This value, "there is more to life," is a core principle at AirTree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. She hopes to demonstrate that it is not an "either/or" situation between a successful career and a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

## High Tolerance for Stress and Perspective
McDonald's husband, Tom, describes her as a "machine," noting her high tolerance for stress and ability to manage multiple responsibilities without being easily overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. This resilience stems partly from her personal drive and ambition, as well as a childhood marked by her mother's prolonged illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. Her mother's battle with brain cancer from a young age provided McDonald with a profound perspective on what truly matters in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. This experience instilled in her a balanced view, reminding her that many daily stresses are "mostly water off a duck's back" compared to greater hardships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

> "I have a very balanced perspective on what's important in life and try to remind myself of these stresses are just mostly water off a duck's back in terms of how it should impact me like there are much worse things that could happen in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>

## Drive and Purpose
McDonald's drive to achieve is deeply personal, stemming from a desire to honor her mother's legacy and sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>. She feels an obligation to live as full and happy a life as possible, achieving as much as she can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>. This intrinsic motivation, rather than a pursuit of external validation, fuels her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>. She believes in pursuing passions, as this naturally leads to exceptional performance and makes the demanding nature of her role enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>.

## Empathy and Competitive Nature
While highly competitive, McDonald's competitiveness is balanced by deep empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>. She clarifies that being competitive does not mean stepping over others or causing destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>. Her approach is rooted in achieving success as a team, ensuring that her actions consider their impact on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>.

## Personal Relationships and Support Systems
McDonald highlights the importance of a strong, supportive partnership, particularly when both partners have demanding careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>. Her relationship with her husband, Tom, built on 14 years together and a foundation of friendship, provides unwavering support amidst the chaos of raising three children and managing intense jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:22:00">[40:22:00]</a>.

As a VC, McDonald also counsels founders on their personal lives and relationships, acknowledging the stress of [[the_balance_of_work_and_personal_life_for_entrepreneurs | balancing work and personal life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:17:00">[42:17:00]</a>. She emphasizes the need for partners who understand and can be trusted to share vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:41:00">[43:41:00]</a>. She advises that it can be refreshing to have a partner outside the industry for diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:27:00">[43:27:00]</a>.

## Advice for Ambitious Young Women
For young ambitious women aspiring to [[balancing_family_and_career_success | balance a successful career and family life]], McDonald offers several key pieces of advice:

*   **Find the Right Company:** Seek out companies whose values align with your own, especially those that recognize "there's more to life" than just work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:16:00">[49:16:00]</a>. AirTree, for instance, leads by example with present and engaged parents at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:22:00">[49:22:00]</a>.
*   **Love Your Job:** Ensure you genuinely love your career before having children. If you don't love it, it will be incredibly difficult to leave your children for something that doesn't inspire you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:56:00">[49:56:00]</a>.
*   **Tactical Financial Planning:** When considering childcare costs, view it as a shared household expense rather than solely against your individual salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:28:00">[50:28:00]</a>. Also, plan for superannuation and long-term financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:37:00">[50:37:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Outputs, Not Face Time:** Work in an environment that measures performance based on results rather than hours spent in the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:47:00">[51:47:00]</a>. This flexibility allows individuals to manage different life stages and pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:13:00">[51:13:00]</a>.

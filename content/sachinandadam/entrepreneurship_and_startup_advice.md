Ben Thompson, a business mastermind, is the founder of Employment Hero, a company that scaled from zero dollars to over one billion dollars, achieving unicorn status [00:00:04 | 00:00:06 | 00:00:43]. His career spans scaling multiple companies and living life as an [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_mindset | entrepreneur]] [00:01:23 | 00:01:25].

## The Driving Motivation: A Passion for Technology
Ben's core motivation has always been a love for technology [00:03:12 | 00:03:46]. This passion began with his first digital watch and continued through early experiences with VCRs and coding his first Dick Smith computer to play games [00:03:34 | 00:03:37 | 00:03:40 | 00:03:42]. He is fascinated by anything new and interesting in technology, from new gadgets to advanced AI software like DALL-E [00:04:12 | 00:04:15].

Despite studying economics and law, Ben always aimed to combine his background with technology [00:04:21 | 00:04:30 | 00:04:33]. He recalls being inspired by radio discussions in the 1980s about Steve Jobs and Bill Gates battling to build the biggest technology companies [00:04:45 | 00:04:51 | 00:04:56]. From that point, he knew he wanted to build a large technology company himself [00:05:03 | 00:05:16].

## Early Entrepreneurial Ventures
Ben's first forays into [[entrepreneurship_and_decisionmaking | entrepreneurship]] began early, including selling citrus fruit from his backyard at a local market [00:05:28 | 00:05:30 | 00:05:34 | 00:05:39]. He also did paper runs, managed a pub while at university, and even started a recruitment agency focused on placing ex-politicians into corporate roles, though that venture "didn't really work" [00:05:50 | 00:05:52 | 00:05:54 | 00:05:56 | 00:06:01 | 00:06:07].

He describes himself as "sniffing out" opportunities and constantly asking "what's something to try? Could it work? Why would it work?" [00:06:14 | 00:06:16 | 00:06:18]. Ben believes his current skills are a "long continuum" from these early experiences, likening his career to playing with a Lego set that has simply grown bigger and more sophisticated over time [00:07:02 | 00:07:09 | 00:07:11 | 00:07:15 | 00:07:22 | 00:07:24]. He also notes that Employment Hero is essentially a digitized version of employment law, a field he unexpectedly entered [00:07:32 | 00:07:34 | 00:07:40].

## The Genesis of Employment Hero
Ben's journey to Employment Hero began after working as a trader on the Sydney Futures Exchange, in derivatives law, mergers and acquisitions, and technology law in London during the dot-com boom [00:08:05 | 00:08:07 | 00:08:08 | 00:08:13 | 00:08:15 | 00:08:17 | 00:08:19]. After returning to Sydney, he started his own law firm, intending it to be a technology law firm [00:08:31 | 00:08:36 | 00:08:38 | 00:08:40].

However, introductions from his father, an HR consultant, led him to small and medium-sized business (SMB) clients who all expressed the same challenge: being an employer was incredibly difficult and time-consuming [00:08:42 | 00:08:44 | 00:08:52 | 00:08:54 | 00:08:56 | 00:09:07 | 00:09:12 | 00:09:14 | 00:09:17 | 00:09:18]. In the early 2000s, there was also a strong anti-employer sentiment, making even minor errors a public issue [00:09:25 | 00:09:26 | 00:09:28 | 00:09:30 | 00:09:34 | 00:09:35 | 00:09:37].

Recognizing this systemic anxiety among SMB employers – who account for 99% of businesses and 70% of jobs globally – Ben saw a massive "handbrake on the economy" [00:09:46 | 00:09:48 | 00:09:52 | 00:09:55 | 00:10:00 | 00:10:03 | 00:10:05 | 00:10:08 | 00:10:09 | 00:10:14 | 00:10:16 | 00:10:17 | 00:10:20]. He realized that 95% of employment processes (recruitment, onboarding, performance management, payroll) are standard and could be centralized and streamlined [00:10:26 | 00:10:28 | 00:10:30 | 00:10:33 | 00:10:35 | 00:10:38 | 00:10:41]. This led to the creation of Employment Innovations, a services business acting as an HR back office for SMBs across Australia [00:10:51 | 00:10:53 | 00:10:56 | 00:10:58 | 00:11:00 | 00:11:04].

The turning point for Employment Hero came when Ben read Marc Andreessen's article, "Why Software Will Eat the World," which warned that services businesses not becoming technology businesses would "get smashed" [00:11:18 | 00:11:20 | 00:11:21 | 00:11:24 | 00:11:26 | 00:11:28 | 00:11:30 | 00:11:32 | 00:11:33 | 00:11:36 | 00:11:38 | 00:11:41 | 00:11:42]. He immediately recognized the need to digitize their services, starting with replacing two full-time employees photocopying welcome packs with a digital onboarding product [00:11:46 | 00:11:49 | 00:11:51 | 00:11:53 | 00:11:55 | 00:11:57 | 00:12:00 | 00:12:03 | 00:12:06]. Ben then mapped out the product and co-founded Employment Hero with Dave Tong as the critical technical co-founder [00:12:10 | 00:12:13 | 00:12:14 | 00:12:16 | 00:12:19 | 00:12:21 | 00:12:24 | 00:12:26].

## Challenges in Scaling and [[Entrepreneurship and risk management strategies | Risk Management]]
Ben highlights that finding product-market fit is the initial challenge [00:12:44 | 00:12:49 | 00:12:50 | 00:12:53]. Early on, their focus was on acquiring users, even visualizing growth by moving a Superman figure along a string for every thousand users [00:13:02 | 00:13:03 | 00:13:07 | 00:13:09 | 00:13:18 | 00:13:20 | 00:13:25 | 00:13:27 | 00:13:29]. However, a significant mistake was hiring enterprise salespeople who shifted the company's focus away from SMBs to larger clients [00:13:43 | 00:13:45 | 00:13:47 | 00:13:49 | 00:13:51 | 00:13:54 | 00:13:55 | 00:13:58 | 00:14:00].

This led to their development roadmap being dictated by a few large customers, compromising their intended product vision [00:14:02 | 00:14:05 | 00:14:06 | 00:14:09 | 00:14:11 | 00:14:13 | 00:14:17 | 00:14:20 | 00:14:22]. One of the hardest decisions was to inform these large customers that Employment Hero would no longer support their specific demands, giving them the choice to use the platform as intended or leave [00:14:25 | 00:14:26 | 00:14:29 | 00:14:30 | 00:14:31 | 00:14:33 | 00:14:34 | 00:14:39 | 00:14:41].

### Bootstrapping and Capital Needs
Another constant challenge was facing bankruptcy "every other day" [00:14:47 | 00:14:50 | 00:14:51]. Ben initially bootstrapped Employment Hero using profits from his other businesses, Employment Innovations and Power to Motivate [00:14:52 | 00:14:54 | 00:14:56 | 00:14:58 | 00:15:02 | 00:16:01 | 00:16:02 | 00:16:04 | 00:16:06 | 00:16:10 | 00:16:12 | 00:16:13 | 00:16:17 | 00:16:19 | 00:16:20 | 00:16:23 | 00:16:25 | 00:16:27 | 00:16:29 | 00:16:31 | 00:16:34 | 00:16:35 | 00:16:38]. However, he later learned that a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) startup requires significant capital for growth, largely because customer acquisition costs are paid upfront [00:15:05 | 00:15:07 | 00:15:11 | 00:15:12 | 00:15:15 | 00:15:17 | 00:15:20 | 00:15:23 | 00:15:26 | 00:15:28 | 00:15:31 | 00:15:32 | 00:15:35 | 00:15:37]. This realization forced him to seek external funding, including a venture debt round and a Series A [00:15:37 | 00:15:39 | 00:15:41 | 00:15:43 | 00:15:45 | 00:15:47 | 00:16:43 | 00:16:45 | 00:16:47 | 00:16:49 | 00:16:51 | 00:16:53 | 00:16:55 | 00:16:57 | 00:17:00 | 00:17:02 | 00:17:05 | 00:17:07].

### The Darkest Hours and Persistence
Ben clarifies that his financial struggles were about the business winding up, not personal bankruptcy [00:17:32 | 00:17:33 | 00:17:35 | 00:17:37 | 00:17:39]. One particularly challenging period was when changes in employment legislation, such as Work Choices and the Fair Work Act, caused cash flow to dry up for months in his services business [00:17:45 | 00:17:48 | 00:17:52 | 00:17:53 | 00:17:55 | 00:17:57 | 00:18:00 | 00:18:01 | 00:18:04 | 00:18:07 | 00:18:08 | 00:18:10 | 00:18:12 | 00:18:14 | 00:18:16 | 00:18:18 | 00:18:21 | 00:18:23 | 00:18:25 | 00:18:27 | 00:18:28]. At one point, he found the company had only $27,000 with a $50,000 payroll due [00:18:53 | 00:18:54 | 00:18:56 | 00:18:57 | 00:18:58 | 00:19:00 | 00:19:03 | 00:19:04 | 00:19:06 | 00:19:08 | 00:19:10 | 00:19:11 | 00:19:13 | 00:19:15 | 00:19:18].

His guiding philosophy through adversity is Winston Churchill's quote, "When you're going through hell, keep going" [00:19:40 | 00:19:41 | 00:19:43 | 00:19:45 | 00:19:47 | 00:19:49 | 00:19:51 | 00:19:53 | 00:19:55 | 00:19:56 | 00:19:58 | 00:19:59]. He emphasizes that if you don't keep going, you lose [00:19:38 | 00:19:41]. Ben also points out that the constant challenges and "fires" faced by startup founders are common to "mum and dad enterprises" (small and medium-sized businesses) globally [00:20:05 | 00:20:07 | 00:20:08 | 00:20:10 | 00:20:12 | 00:20:14 | 00:20:16 | 00:20:17 | 00:20:21 | 00:20:24 | 00:20:27 | 00:20:31 | 00:20:34 | 00:20:35 | 00:20:38 | 00:20:40 | 00:20:43 | 00:20:45 | 00:20:47 | 00:20:48]. He finds pleasure in building a business to support SMBs because they genuinely need help [00:20:51 | 00:20:53 | 00:20:54 | 00:20:57].

## Reflections on Scaling and No Regrets
When asked if he would do anything differently, Ben states, "Nothing, I don't think I'd do anything differently" [00:21:30 | 00:21:31 | 00:21:32]. He has no regrets, feels he has acted ethically, and accepts the ups and downs as part of the adrenaline of business [00:21:34 | 00:21:36 | 00:21:38 | 00:21:41 | 00:21:44 | 00:21:47 | 00:21:49 | 00:21:51 | 00:21:53 | 00:21:57]. He attributes much of his success to having a great co-founder and an awesome team [00:22:04 | 00:22:06].

## The Future of Work: Remote and Hybrid
Ben strongly believes the office will not return to its pre-pandemic state [00:23:29 | 00:23:31 | 00:23:34]. Surveys conducted by Employment Hero in 2020 and 2021 across Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, and the UK showed that 92% (rising to 94% in 2021) of employees expected to work remotely at least one day a week [00:23:37 | 00:23:38 | 00:23:40 | 00:23:43 | 00:23:45 | 00:23:47 | 00:23:49 | 00:23:54 | 00:23:57 | 00:23:59 | 00:24:01 | 00:24:04 | 00:24:07 | 00:24:09 | 00:24:12 | 00:24:15 | 00:24:16]. He highlights that such a high level of agreement on any subject is rare [00:24:18 | 00:24:20 | 00:24:26 | 00:24:28 | 00:24:30 | 00:24:32].

Ben outlines several reasons why remote and hybrid work are superior:
*   **Talent Pool**: Forcing employees to commute limits the talent pool to a small geographic radius. Remote work expands it to billions globally, which is crucial when talent is tight [00:24:48 | 00:24:50 | 00:24:52 | 00:24:55 | 00:24:58 | 00:25:00 | 00:25:02 | 00:25:04 | 00:25:07 | 00:25:11 | 00:25:13 | 00:25:15 | 00:25:16 | 00:25:18 | 00:25:20 | 00:25:22 | 00:25:24 | 00:25:26 | 00:25:28 | 00:25:31 | 00:25:33 | 00:25:36 | 00:25:38 | 00:25:40 | 00:25:43 | 00:25:46 | 00:25:48].
*   **Social and Moral Benefits**: Remote work supports working parents, enables people to live in rural areas while participating in the global economy, and offers opportunities for those currently without internet access to enter the global workforce [00:25:53 | 00:25:55 | 00:25:58 | 00:26:00 | 00:26:02 | 00:26:05 | 00:26:07 | 00:26:09 | 00:26:11 | 00:26:13 | 00:26:16 | 00:26:18 | 00:26:20 | 00:26:22 | 00:26:24 | 00:26:26 | 00:26:27 | 00:26:28 | 00:26:30 | 00:26:33 | 00:26:35 | 00:26:37 | 00:26:40 | 00:26:42 | 00:26:45 | 00:26:48 | 00:26:50 | 00:26:53 | 00:26:55 | 00:26:58 | 00:26:59 | 00:27:02 | 00:27:04 | 00:27:06 | 00:27:08 | 00:27:10]. The impending global internet coverage within five years will bring three billion new people online, potentially lifting them out of poverty through online work [00:27:13 | 00:27:15 | 00:27:18 | 00:27:20 | 00:27:22 | 00:27:25 | 00:27:27 | 00:27:30 | 00:27:31 | 00:27:33 | 00:27:34 | 00:27:37 | 00:27:40 | 00:27:42 | 00:27:44 | 00:27:46 | 00:27:48 | 00:27:50 | 00:27:53 | 00:27:54 | 00:27:58 | 00:28:00 | 00:28:02 | 00:28:04 | 00:28:06 | 00:28:08 | 00:28:10].
*   **Health and Balance**: Ben criticizes traditional office work as being "like a chicken coop," comparing skyscrapers to cages where people are forced to commute and work under artificial conditions [00:28:17 | 00:28:19 | 00:28:22 | 00:28:24 | 00:28:27 | 00:28:28 | 00:28:31 | 00:28:33 | 00:28:36 | 00:28:38 | 00:28:39 | 00:28:41 | 00:28:43 | 00:28:45 | 00:28:47 | 00:28:49 | 00:28:51 | 00:28:54 | 00:28:56 | 00:28:58 | 00:29:00]. Remote work, he argues, is healthier and more balanced [00:29:02 | 00:29:05].

While acknowledging the importance of in-person learning and social elements for young professionals, Ben advocates for a hybrid model [00:29:57 | 00:29:59 | 00:30:02 | 00:30:04 | 00:30:06 | 00:30:08 | 00:30:11 | 00:30:13]. He believes a good manager will strategically bring teams together for learning and social cohesion [00:31:05 | 00:31:07 | 00:31:09]. He envisions a social network for remote employees to connect geographically for social activities [00:30:30 | 00:30:32 | 00:30:34 | 00:30:36 | 00:30:37 | 00:30:39 | 00:30:42 | 00:30:43 | 00:30:45 | 00:30:46 | 00:30:49 | 00:30:51 | 00:30:52].

## Current Market Conditions and Startup Strategies
Ben advises watching the All-In podcast and Craft Ventures' David Sacks for insights on the current market [00:32:50 | 00:32:52 | 00:32:54 | 00:32:57 | 00:33:01 | 00:33:04 | 00:33:06 | 00:33:08 | 00:33:11 | 00:33:13 | 00:33:15]. He explains that rising interest rates cause pension funds to move money from speculative tech stocks back into safer bonds, leading to less capital and tougher fundraising conditions for startups [00:33:18 | 00:33:19 | 00:33:22 | 00:33:24 | 00:33:26 | 00:33:28 | 00:33:30 | 00:33:32 | 00:33:35 | 00:33:37 | 00:33:38 | 00:33:41 | 00:33:42 | 00:33:44 | 00:33:46 | 00:33:48 | 00:33:51 | 00:33:53 | 00:33:56 | 00:33:59 | 00:34:02 | 00:34:03 | 00:34:06 | 00:34:09 | 00:34:10]. Only higher-quality companies will be able to raise [00:34:12 | 00:34:14].

Employment Hero is in a strong position, having completed a $170 million capital raise, providing over three years of runway [00:34:21 | 00:34:24 | 00:34:27 | 00:34:29 | 00:34:31 | 00:34:33]. They can break even if needed and have strong unit economics, thanks to an obsession with these metrics since their Series A, guided by John Henderson from AirTree [00:34:35 | 00:34:37 | 00:34:39 | 00:34:43 | 00:34:45 | 00:34:46 | 00:34:49 | 00:34:51 | 00:34:54 | 00:34:56 | 00:34:58 | 00:35:01 | 00:35:03 | 00:35:05 | 00:35:07 | 00:35:08 | 00:35:10 | 00:35:13 | 00:35:15 | 00:35:18].

For startups with limited runway and poor unit economics, Ben advises:
*   **Pivot**: Be prepared to change your business model [00:35:20 | 00:35:22 | 00:35:24 | 00:35:26 | 00:35:28 | 00:35:31 | 00:35:33 | 00:35:36 | 00:37:47].
*   **Cut Hard and Early**: The best advice is to be decisive with layoffs if necessary, even if it means letting friends go [00:35:57 | 00:35:58 | 00:36:01 | 00:36:04 | 00:36:06 | 00:36:08 | 00:36:10 | 00:36:12 | 00:36:15 | 00:36:16 | 00:36:20].
*   **Be Conservative**: Batten down the hatches and prepare for the worst [00:37:39 | 00:37:42 | 00:37:45].

Ben remains optimistic, noting that recessions typically lead to lower interest rates, creating counter-cyclical forces [00:36:26 | 00:36:28 | 00:36:32 | 00:36:34 | 00:36:37 | 00:36:39 | 00:36:41 | 00:36:42 | 00:36:45]. He also points out Australia's history of avoiding recessions when the US is in one [00:37:03 | 00:37:04 | 00:37:06 | 00:37:08 | 00:37:10 | 00:37:12 | 00:37:13 | 00:37:15 | 00:37:17 | 00:37:18].

### Not the Dot-Com Crash 2.0
Ben differentiates the current market from the dot-com crash of the late 1990s, where exuberance and unproven business models led to the bust [00:37:53 | 00:37:55 | 00:37:58 | 00:38:00 | 00:38:02 | 00:38:04 | 00:38:07 | 00:38:09 | 00:38:11 | 00:38:13 | 00:38:16 | 00:38:18 | 00:38:21 | 00:38:24 | 00:38:27 | 00:38:29 | 00:38:33 | 00:38:34 | 00:38:36 | 00:38:38 | 00:38:41 | 00:38:44]. Today, the market shift is driven by macroeconomic forces, not by a broken SaaS or technology model [00:38:54 | 00:38:58 | 00:39:00 | 00:39:02 | 00:39:04 | 00:39:07 | 00:39:08 | 00:39:09 | 00:39:13 | 00:39:15 | 00:39:17 | 00:39:18 | 00:39:20 | 00:39:23 | 00:39:25 | 00:39:27 | 00:39:28 | 00:39:30 | 00:39:32 | 00:39:34 | 00:39:35 | 00:39:37 | 00:39:40 | 00:39:42].

## [[Advice for young Australian entrepreneurs | Advice for Young Entrepreneurs]] and Joining Startups
Ben offers the following [[advice_on_entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | advice on entrepreneurship and startup success]]:

*   **Conviction in Your Idea**: There's a big difference between an average idea and a "fundamentally valuable idea" based on first principles [00:40:50 | 00:40:53 | 00:40:57 | 00:40:59 | 00:41:01 | 00:41:02 | 00:41:04]. If you have absolute conviction and passion for an idea, pursue it, as it will build experience even if it doesn't succeed [00:41:07 | 00:41:09 | 00:41:12 | 00:41:14 | 00:41:17 | 00:41:21 | 00:41:40 | 00:41:42 | 00:41:44 | 00:41:46 | 00:41:48]. However, if you're second-guessing or lack passion, it might not be the right time [00:41:25 | 00:41:27 | 00:41:29 | 00:41:31 | 00:41:34 | 00:41:36].
*   **Understand Liquidation Preferences**: When considering joining a startup for equity, understand the "waterfall" of liquidation preferences, as headline valuations might not translate to returns for employees if the company is wound up or revalued downwards [00:42:37 | 00:42:43 | 00:42:46 | 00:42:48 | 00:42:50 | 00:42:51 | 00:42:53 | 00:42:54 | 00:42:56 | 00:42:58 | 00:43:00 | 00:43:03 | 00:43:05 | 00:43:07 | 00:43:09 | 00:43:10 | 00:43:13 | 00:43:14 | 00:43:15 | 00:43:17 | 00:43:19 | 00:43:22].
*   **Commitment to the Journey**: Joining a startup means being "in business" and being prepared for ups and downs, including potential down rounds [00:44:03 | 00:44:05 | 00:44:08 | 00:44:10 | 00:44:12 | 00:44:13 | 00:44:15 | 00:44:17 | 00:44:19 | 00:44:21 | 00:44:22 | 00:44:24 | 00:44:27]. Those who flee during tough times are "not the people who are really going to be there through the hard times" [00:43:52 | 00:43:54 | 00:43:56 | 00:43:58 | 00:43:59]. Facing [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_culture | challenges]] and fighting back can be the most rewarding times [00:44:31 | 00:44:33 | 00:44:34 | 00:44:37 | 00:44:39 | 00:44:40].
*   **Focus on Unit Economics**: Profits now matter, not just revenue [00:44:59 | 00:45:00]. Young people should ask about key SaaS metrics like burn multiple, growth rate, gross margin, and return on customer acquisition cost (CAC) when considering joining a startup [00:45:24 | 00:45:25 | 00:45:27 | 00:45:28 | 00:45:30 | 00:45:32 | 00:45:33 | 00:45:37 | 00:45:39 | 00:45:40 | 00:45:42 | 00:45:44 | 00:45:45]. Aim to join companies that are in the "excellent" bracket based on these metrics, not the "unfundable" ones [00:45:49 | 00:45:51 | 00:45:53 | 00:45:56].

## Qualities of a Great Leader
Ben believes a crucial quality for a great leader and [[execution_and_leadership_in_startups | entrepreneurship]] is "vision" [00:47:49 | 00:47:52]. This involves clearly seeing the product in your mind's eye, understanding what you're building, why it works, and ensuring there's sufficient market demand [00:47:58 | 00:48:00 | 00:48:02 | 00:48:07 | 00:48:08 | 00:48:10 | 00:48:12 | 00:48:14 | 00:48:16 | 00:48:17 | 00:48:21 | 00:48:22 | 00:48:24 | 00:48:26]. He considers this ability a "gift" and feels lucky to have applied it multiple times [00:48:27 | 00:48:30 | 00:48:34 | 00:48:36].

## A Startup Idea: Remote Social
Ben envisions a social network for remote employees, tentatively named "Remote Social," to address the missing social aspect of work [00:48:45 | 00:48:46 | 00:48:48 | 00:48:50 | 00:48:52 | 00:48:55 | 00:48:56 | 00:48:58 | 00:48:59 | 00:49:00]. This platform would connect remote workers within geographic boundaries, facilitating in-person social events like Friday night drinks [00:49:02 | 00:49:04 | 00:49:05 | 00:49:07 | 00:49:09 | 00:49:11 | 00:49:14]. He believes it would be easy to connect people and could potentially generate revenue by partnering with venues [00:49:02 | 00:49:04 | 00:49:05 | 00:49:07 | 0:49:09 | 00:49:11].

## Personal Reflections
Ben is a husband and father of three, and his wife shares responsibilities, with him being the "boss outside of the house" and her being the "boss at home" [00:01:37 | 00:01:39 | 00:01:41 | 00:01:43 | 00:01:44 | 00:01:47 | 00:01:49 | 00:01:53 | 00:01:55]. He enjoys sailing and is a proud Northern Beaches native who rarely leaves the area, working remotely full-time for the last two and a half years [00:02:01 | 00:02:03 | 00:02:05 | 00:02:07 | 00:02:09 | 00:02:12 | 00:02:14 | 00:02:16 | 00:02:19 | 00:02:20]. He also states that his business is his hobby, spending "a ridiculous amount of time working on [his] hobby," which feels like "playing with [his] Legos and building things and having fun" [00:02:32 | 00:02:34 | 00:02:36 | 00:02:38 | 00:02:41 | 00:02:43 | 00:02:45].

A crazy moment from his adventures was proposing to his wife at the top of Tharpu Chuli, a 6,500-meter mountain in Nepal [00:49:21 | 00:49:23 | 00:49:26 | 00:49:27 | 00:49:31 | 00:49:34]. He soloed it with a sherpa, took a photo with a "Will you marry me" sign, and then immediately had to descend due to altitude sickness [00:49:36 | 00:49:37 | 00:49:40 | 00:49:41 | 00:49:45 | 00:49:47 | 00:49:50 | 00:49:52 | 00:49:54 | 00:49:56 | 00:49:58].

He finds space exploration inspiring, particularly watching SpaceX and the community of "nerds" tracking the construction of Starship, which represents pushing the edge of physics to make humans multi-planetary [00:50:16 | 00:50:18 | 00:50:21 | 00:50:24 | 00:50:26 | 00:50:30 | 00:50:32 | 00:50:35 | 00:50:37 | 00:50:39 | 00:50:44 | 00:50:46 | 00:50:48 | 00:50:50 | 00:50:52 | 00:50:54 | 00:50:56 | 00:51:00 | 00:51:02 | 00:51:04 | 00:51:06 | 00:51:09].

His yacht is named "Alliance" mirroring the name he gives to his group of companies, which include Employment Hero, Power to Motivate, KeyPay, and Employment Innovations [00:51:14 | 00:51:17 | 00:51:21 | 00:51:23 | 00:51:25 | 00:51:26 | 00:51:28 | 00:51:31 | 00:51:33]. This alliance encourages movement between companies and is a brand he considered for a future startup fund [00:51:35 | 00:51:37 | 00:51:38 | 00:51:42 | 00:51:44 | 00:51:48 | 00:51:50 | 00:51:52 | 00:51:54 | 00:51:55].# Entrepreneurship and Startup Advice from Ben Thompson

Ben Thompson, a business mastermind, is the founder of Employment Hero, a company that scaled from zero dollars to over one billion dollars, achieving unicorn status [00:00:04 | 00:00:06 | 00:00:43]. His career spans scaling multiple companies and living life as an [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_mindset | entrepreneur]] [00:01:23 | 00:01:25].

## The Driving Motivation: A Passion for Technology
Ben's core motivation has always been a love for technology [00:03:12 | 00:03:46]. This passion began with his first digital watch and continued through early experiences with VCRs and coding his first Dick Smith computer to play games [00:03:34 | 00:03:37 | 00:03:40 | 00:03:42]. He is fascinated by anything new and interesting in technology, from new gadgets to advanced AI software like DALL-E [00:04:12 | 00:04:15].

Despite studying economics and law, Ben always aimed to combine his background with technology [00:04:21 | 00:04:30 | 00:04:33]. He recalls being inspired by radio discussions in the 1980s about Steve Jobs and Bill Gates battling to build the biggest technology companies [00:04:45 | 00:04:51 | 00:04:56]. From that point, he knew he wanted to build a large technology company himself [00:05:03 | 00:05:16].

## Early Entrepreneurial Ventures
Ben's first forays into [[entrepreneurship_and_decisionmaking | entrepreneurship]] began early, including selling citrus fruit from his backyard at a local market [00:05:28 | 00:05:30 | 00:05:34 | 00:05:39]. He also did paper runs, managed a pub while at university, and even started a recruitment agency focused on placing ex-politicians into corporate roles, though that venture "didn't really work" [00:05:50 | 00:05:52 | 00:05:54 | 00:05:56 | 00:06:01 | 00:06:07].

He describes himself as "sniffing out" opportunities and constantly asking "what's something to try? Could it work? Why would it work?" [00:06:14 | 00:06:16 | 00:06:18]. Ben believes his current skills are a "long continuum" from these early experiences, likening his career to playing with a Lego set that has simply grown bigger and more sophisticated over time [00:07:02 | 00:07:09 | 00:07:11 | 00:07:15 | 00:07:22 | 00:07:24]. He also notes that Employment Hero is essentially a digitized version of employment law, a field he unexpectedly entered [00:07:32 | 00:07:34 | 00:07:40].

## The Genesis of Employment Hero
Ben's journey to Employment Hero began after working as a trader on the Sydney Futures Exchange, in derivatives law, mergers and acquisitions, and technology law in London during the dot-com boom [00:08:05 | 00:08:07 | 00:08:08 | 00:08:13 | 00:08:15 | 00:08:17 | 00:08:19]. After returning to Sydney, he started his own law firm, intending it to be a technology law firm [00:08:31 | 00:08:36 | 00:08:38 | 00:08:40].

However, introductions from his father, an HR consultant, led him to small and medium-sized business (SMB) clients who all expressed the same challenge: being an employer was incredibly difficult and time-consuming [00:08:42 | 00:08:44 | 00:08:52 | 00:08:54 | 00:08:56 | 00:09:07 | 00:09:12 | 00:09:14 | 00:09:17 | 00:09:18]. In the early 2000s, there was also a strong anti-employer sentiment, making even minor errors a public issue [00:09:25 | 00:09:26 | 00:09:28 | 00:09:30 | 00:09:34 | 00:09:35 | 00:09:37].

Recognizing this systemic anxiety among SMB employers – who account for 99% of businesses and 70% of jobs globally – Ben saw a massive "handbrake on the economy" [00:09:46 | 00:09:48 | 00:09:52 | 00:09:55 | 00:10:00 | 00:10:03 | 00:10:05 | 00:10:08 | 00:10:09 | 00:10:14 | 00:10:16 | 00:10:17 | 00:10:20]. He realized that 95% of employment processes (recruitment, onboarding, performance management, payroll) are standard and could be centralized and streamlined [00:10:26 | 00:10:28 | 00:10:30 | 00:10:33 | 00:10:35 | 00:10:38 | 00:10:41]. This led to the creation of Employment Innovations, a services business acting as an HR back office for SMBs across Australia [00:10:51 | 00:10:53 | 00:10:56 | 00:10:58 | 00:11:00 | 00:11:04].

The turning point for Employment Hero came when Ben read Marc Andreessen's article, "Why Software Will Eat the World," which warned that services businesses not becoming technology businesses would "get smashed" [00:11:18 | 00:11:20 | 00:11:21 | 00:11:24 | 00:11:26 | 00:11:28 | 00:11:30 | 00:11:32 | 00:11:33 | 00:11:36 | 00:11:38 | 00:11:41 | 00:11:42]. He immediately recognized the need to digitize their services, starting with replacing two full-time employees photocopying welcome packs with a digital onboarding product [00:11:46 | 00:11:49 | 00:11:51 | 00:11:53 | 00:11:55 | 00:11:57 | 00:12:00 | 00:12:03 | 00:12:06]. Ben then mapped out the product and co-founded Employment Hero with Dave Tong as the critical technical co-founder [00:12:10 | 00:12:13 | 00:12:14 | 00:12:16 | 00:12:19 | 00:12:21 | 00:12:24 | 00:12:26].

## Challenges in Scaling and [[Entrepreneurship and risk management strategies | Risk Management]]
Ben highlights that finding product-market fit is the initial challenge [00:12:44 | 00:12:49 | 00:12:50 | 00:12:53]. Early on, their focus was on acquiring users, even visualizing growth by moving a Superman figure along a string for every thousand users [00:13:02 | 00:13:03 | 00:13:07 | 00:13:09 | 00:13:18 | 00:13:20 | 00:13:25 | 00:13:27 | 00:13:29]. However, a significant mistake was hiring enterprise salespeople who shifted the company's focus away from SMBs to larger clients [00:13:43 | 00:13:45 | 00:13:47 | 00:13:49 | 00:13:51 | 00:13:54 | 00:13:55 | 00:13:58 | 00:14:00].

This led to their development roadmap being dictated by a few large customers, compromising their intended product vision [00:14:02 | 00:14:05 | 00:14:06 | 00:14:09 | 00:14:11 | 00:14:13 | 00:14:17 | 00:14:20 | 00:14:22]. One of the hardest decisions was to inform these large customers that Employment Hero would no longer support their specific demands, giving them the choice to use the platform as intended or leave [00:14:25 | 00:14:26 | 00:14:29 | 00:14:30 | 00:14:31 | 00:14:33 | 00:14:34 | 00:14:39 | 00:14:41].

### Bootstrapping and Capital Needs
Another constant challenge was facing bankruptcy "every other day" [00:14:47 | 00:14:50 | 00:14:51]. Ben initially bootstrapped Employment Hero using profits from his other businesses, Employment Innovations and Power to Motivate [00:14:52 | 00:14:54 | 00:14:56 | 00:14:58 | 00:15:02 | 00:16:01 | 00:16:02 | 00:16:04 | 00:16:06 | 00:16:10 | 00:16:12 | 00:16:13 | 00:16:17 | 00:16:19 | 00:16:20 | 00:16:23 | 00:16:25 | 00:16:27 | 00:16:29 | 00:16:31 | 00:16:34 | 00:16:35 | 00:16:38]. However, he later learned that a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) startup requires significant capital for growth, largely because customer acquisition costs are paid upfront [00:15:05 | 00:15:07 | 00:15:11 | 00:15:12 | 00:15:15 | 00:15:17 | 00:15:20 | 00:15:23 | 00:15:26 | 00:15:28 | 00:15:31 | 00:15:32 | 00:15:35 | 00:15:37]. This realization forced him to seek external funding, including a venture debt round and a Series A [00:15:37 | 00:15:39 | 00:15:41 | 00:15:43 | 00:15:45 | 00:15:47 | 00:16:43 | 00:16:45 | 00:16:47 | 00:16:49 | 00:16:51 | 00:16:53 | 00:16:55 | 00:16:57 | 00:17:00 | 00:17:02 | 00:17:05 | 00:17:07].

### The Darkest Hours and Persistence
Ben clarifies that his financial struggles were about the business winding up, not personal bankruptcy [00:17:32 | 00:17:33 | 00:17:35 | 00:17:37 | 00:17:39]. One particularly challenging period was when changes in employment legislation, such as Work Choices and the Fair Work Act, caused cash flow to dry up for months in his services business [00:17:45 | 00:17:48 | 00:17:52 | 00:17:53 | 00:17:55 | 00:17:57 | 00:18:00 | 00:18:01 | 00:18:04 | 00:18:07 | 00:18:08 | 00:18:10 | 00:18:12 | 00:18:14 | 00:18:16 | 00:18:18 | 00:18:21 | 00:18:23 | 00:18:25 | 00:18:27 | 00:18:28]. At one point, he found the company had only $27,000 with a $50,000 payroll due [00:18:53 | 00:18:54 | 00:18:56 | 00:18:57 | 00:18:58 | 00:19:00 | 00:19:03 | 00:19:04 | 00:19:06 | 00:19:08 | 00:19:10 | 00:19:11 | 00:19:13 | 00:19:15 | 00:19:18].

His guiding philosophy through adversity is Winston Churchill's quote, "When you're going through hell, keep going" [00:19:40 | 00:19:41 | 00:19:43 | 00:19:45 | 00:19:47 | 00:19:49 | 00:19:51 | 00:19:53 | 00:19:55 | 00:19:56 | 00:19:58 | 00:19:59]. He emphasizes that if you don't keep going, you lose [00:19:38 | 00:19:41]. Ben also points out that the constant challenges and "fires" faced by startup founders are common to "mum and dad enterprises" (small and medium-sized businesses) globally [00:20:05 | 00:20:07 | 00:20:08 | 00:20:10 | 00:20:12 | 00:20:14 | 00:20:16 | 00:20:17 | 00:20:21 | 00:20:24 | 00:20:27 | 00:20:31 | 00:20:34 | 00:20:35 | 00:20:38 | 00:20:40 | 00:20:43 | 00:20:45 | 00:20:47 | 00:20:48]. He finds pleasure in building a business to support SMBs because they genuinely need help [00:20:51 | 00:20:53 | 00:20:54 | 00:20:57].

## Reflections on Scaling and No Regrets
When asked if he would do anything differently, Ben states, "Nothing, I don't think I'd do anything differently" [00:21:30 | 00:21:31 | 00:21:32]. He has no regrets, feels he has acted ethically, and accepts the ups and downs as part of the adrenaline of business [00:21:34 | 00:21:36 | 00:21:38 | 00:21:41 | 00:21:44 | 00:21:47 | 00:21:49 | 00:21:51 | 00:21:53 | 00:21:57]. He attributes much of his success to having a great co-founder and an awesome team [00:22:04 | 00:22:06].

## The Future of Work: Remote and Hybrid
Ben strongly believes the office will not return to its pre-pandemic state [00:23:29 | 00:23:31 | 00:23:34]. Surveys conducted by Employment Hero in 2020 and 2021 across Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, and the UK showed that 92% (rising to 94% in 2021) of employees expected to work remotely at least one day a week [00:23:37 | 00:23:38 | 00:23:40 | 00:23:43 | 00:23:45 | 00:23:47 | 00:23:49 | 00:23:54 | 00:23:57 | 00:23:59 | 00:24:01 | 00:24:04 | 00:24:07 | 00:24:09 | 00:24:12 | 00:24:15 | 00:24:16]. He highlights that such a high level of agreement on any subject is rare [00:24:18 | 00:24:20 | 00:24:26 | 00:24:28 | 00:24:30 | 00:24:32].

Ben outlines several reasons why remote and hybrid work are superior:
*   **Talent Pool**: Forcing employees to commute limits the talent pool to a small geographic radius. Remote work expands it to billions globally, which is crucial when talent is tight [00:24:48 | 00:24:50 | 00:24:52 | 00:24:55 | 00:24:58 | 00:25:00 | 00:25:02 | 00:25:04 | 00:25:07 | 00:25:11 | 00:25:13 | 00:25:15 | 00:25:16 | 00:25:18 | 00:25:20 | 00:25:22 | 00:25:24 | 00:25:26 | 00:25:28 | 00:25:31 | 00:25:33 | 00:25:36 | 00:25:38 | 00:25:40 | 00:25:43 | 00:25:46 | 00:25:48].
*   **Social and Moral Benefits**: Remote work supports working parents, enables people to live in rural areas while participating in the global economy, and offers opportunities for those currently without internet access to enter the global workforce [00:25:53 | 00:25:55 | 00:25:58 | 00:26:00 | 00:26:02 | 00:26:05 | 00:26:07 | 00:26:09 | 00:26:11 | 00:26:13 | 00:26:16 | 00:26:18 | 00:26:20 | 00:26:22 | 00:26:24 | 00:26:26 | 00:26:27 | 00:26:28 | 00:26:30 | 00:26:33 | 00:26:35 | 00:26:37 | 00:26:40 | 00:26:42 | 00:26:45 | 00:26:48 | 00:26:50 | 00:26:53 | 00:26:55 | 00:26:58 | 00:26:59 | 00:27:02 | 00:27:04 | 00:27:06 | 00:27:08 | 00:27:10]. The impending global internet coverage within five years will bring three billion new people online, potentially lifting them out of poverty through online work [00:27:13 | 00:27:15 | 00:27:18 | 00:27:20 | 00:27:22 | 00:27:25 | 00:27:27 | 00:27:30 | 00:27:31 | 00:27:33 | 00:27:34 | 00:27:37 | 00:27:40 | 00:27:42 | 00:27:44 | 00:27:46 | 00:27:48 | 00:27:50 | 00:27:53 | 00:27:54 | 00:27:58 | 00:28:00 | 00:28:02 | 00:28:04 | 00:28:06 | 00:28:08 | 00:28:10].
*   **Health and Balance**: Ben criticizes traditional office work as being "like a chicken coop," comparing skyscrapers to cages where people are forced to commute and work under artificial conditions [00:28:17 | 00:28:19 | 00:28:22 | 00:28:24 | 00:28:27 | 00:28:28 | 00:28:31 | 00:28:33 | 00:28:36 | 00:28:38 | 00:28:39 | 00:28:41 | 00:28:43 | 00:28:45 | 00:28:47 | 00:28:49 | 00:28:51 | 00:28:54 | 00:28:56 | 00:28:58 | 00:29:00]. Remote work, he argues, is healthier and more balanced [00:29:02 | 00:29:05].

While acknowledging the importance of in-person learning and social elements for young professionals, Ben advocates for a hybrid model [00:29:57 | 00:29:59 | 00:30:02 | 00:30:04 | 00:30:06 | 00:30:08 | 00:30:11 | 00:30:13]. He believes a good manager will strategically bring teams together for learning and social cohesion [00:31:05 | 00:31:07 | 00:31:09]. He envisions a social network for remote employees to connect geographically for social activities [00:30:30 | 00:30:32 | 00:30:34 | 00:30:36 | 00:30:37 | 00:30:39 | 00:30:42 | 00:30:43 | 00:30:45 | 00:30:46 | 00:30:49 | 00:30:51 | 00:30:52].

## Current Market Conditions and Startup Strategies
Ben advises watching the All-In podcast and Craft Ventures' David Sacks for insights on the current market [00:32:50 | 00:32:52 | 00:32:54 | 00:32:57 | 00:33:01 | 00:33:04 | 00:33:06 | 00:33:08 | 00:33:11 | 00:33:13 | 00:33:15]. He explains that rising interest rates cause pension funds to move money from speculative tech stocks back into safer bonds, leading to less capital and tougher fundraising conditions for startups [00:33:18 | 00:33:19 | 00:33:22 | 00:33:24 | 00:33:26 | 00:33:28 | 00:33:30 | 00:33:32 | 00:33:35 | 00:33:37 | 00:33:38 | 00:33:41 | 00:33:42 | 00:33:44 | 00:33:46 | 00:33:48 | 00:33:51 | 00:33:53 | 00:33:56 | 00:33:59 | 00:34:02 | 00:34:03 | 00:34:06 | 00:34:09 | 00:34:10]. Only higher-quality companies will be able to raise [00:34:12 | 00:34:14].

Employment Hero is in a strong position, having completed a $170 million capital raise, providing over three years of runway [00:34:21 | 00:34:24 | 00:34:27 | 00:34:29 | 00:34:31 | 00:34:33]. They can break even if needed and have strong unit economics, thanks to an obsession with these metrics since their Series A, guided by John Henderson from AirTree [00:34:35 | 00:34:37 | 00:34:39 | 00:34:43 | 00:34:45 | 00:34:46 | 00:34:49 | 00:34:51 | 00:34:54 | 00:34:56 | 00:34:58 | 00:35:01 | 00:35:03 | 00:35:05 | 00:35:07 | 00:35:08 | 00:35:10 | 00:35:13 | 00:35:15 | 00:35:18].

For startups with limited runway and poor unit economics, Ben advises:
*   **Pivot**: Be prepared to change your business model [00:35:20 | 00:35:22 | 00:35:24 | 00:35:26 | 00:35:28 | 00:35:31 | 00:35:33 | 00:35:36 | 00:37:47].
*   **Cut Hard and Early**: The best advice is to be decisive with layoffs if necessary, even if it means letting friends go [00:35:57 | 00:35:58 | 00:36:01 | 00:36:04 | 00:36:06 | 00:36:08 | 00:36:10 | 00:36:12 | 00:36:15 | 00:36:16 | 00:36:20].
*   **Be Conservative**: Batten down the hatches and prepare for the worst [00:37:39 | 00:37:42 | 00:37:45].

Ben remains optimistic, noting that recessions typically lead to lower interest rates, creating counter-cyclical forces [00:36:26 | 00:36:28 | 00:36:32 | 00:36:34 | 00:36:37 | 00:36:39 | 00:36:41 | 00:36:42 | 00:36:45]. He also points out Australia's history of avoiding recessions when the US is in one [00:37:03 | 00:37:04 | 00:37:06 | 00:37:08 | 00:37:10 | 00:37:12 | 00:37:13 | 00:37:15 | 00:37:17 | 00:37:18].

### Not the Dot-Com Crash 2.0
Ben differentiates the current market from the dot-com crash of the late 1990s, where exuberance and unproven business models led to the bust [00:37:53 | 00:37:55 | 00:37:58 | 00:38:00 | 00:38:02 | 00:38:04 | 00:38:07 | 00:38:09 | 00:38:11 | 00:38:13 | 00:38:16 | 00:38:18 | 00:38:21 | 00:38:24 | 00:38:27 | 00:38:29 | 00:38:33 | 00:38:34 | 00:38:36 | 00:38:38 | 00:38:41 | 00:38:44]. Today, the market shift is driven by macroeconomic forces, not by a broken SaaS or technology model [00:38:54 | 00:38:58 | 00:39:00 | 00:39:02 | 00:39:04 | 00:39:07 | 00:39:08 | 00:39:09 | 00:39:13 | 00:39:15 | 00:39:17 | 00:39:18 | 00:39:20 | 00:39:23 | 00:39:25 | 00:39:27 | 00:39:28 | 00:39:30 | 00:39:32 | 00:39:34 | 00:39:35 | 00:39:37 | 00:39:40 | 00:39:42].

## [[Advice for young Australian entrepreneurs | Advice for Young Entrepreneurs]] and Joining Startups
Ben offers the following [[advice_on_entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | advice on entrepreneurship and startup success]]:

*   **Conviction in Your Idea**: There's a big difference between an average idea and a "fundamentally valuable idea" based on first principles [00:40:50 | 00:40:53 | 00:40:57 | 00:40:59 | 00:41:01 | 00:41:02 | 00:41:04]. If you have absolute conviction and passion for an idea, pursue it, as it will build experience even if it doesn't succeed [00:41:07 | 00:41:09 | 00:41:12 | 00:41:14 | 00:41:17 | 00:41:21 | 00:41:40 | 00:41:42 | 00:41:44 | 00:41:46 | 00:41:48]. However, if you're second-guessing or lack passion, it might not be the right time [00:41:25 | 00:41:27 | 00:41:29 | 00:41:31 | 00:41:34 | 00:41:36].
*   **Understand Liquidation Preferences**: When considering joining a startup for equity, understand the "waterfall" of liquidation preferences, as headline valuations might not translate to returns for employees if the company is wound up or revalued downwards [00:42:37 | 00:42:43 | 00:42:46 | 00:42:48 | 00:42:50 | 00:42:51 | 00:42:53 | 00:42:54 | 00:42:56 | 00:42:58 | 00:43:00 | 00:43:03 | 00:43:05 | 00:43:07 | 00:43:09 | 00:43:10 | 00:43:13 | 00:43:14 | 00:43:15 | 00:43:17 | 00:43:19 | 00:43:22].
*   **Commitment to the Journey**: Joining a startup means being "in business" and being prepared for ups and downs, including potential down rounds [00:44:03 | 00:44:05 | 00:44:08 | 00:44:10 | 00:44:12 | 00:44:13 | 00:44:15 | 00:44:17 | 00:44:19 | 00:44:21 | 00:44:22 | 00:44:24 | 00:44:27]. Those who flee during tough times are "not the people who are really going to be there through the hard times" [00:43:52 | 00:43:54 | 00:43:56 | 00:43:58 | 00:43:59]. Facing [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_culture | challenges]] and fighting back can be the most rewarding times [00:44:31 | 00:44:33 | 00:44:34 | 00:44:37 | 00:44:39 | 00:44:40].
*   **Focus on Unit Economics**: Profits now matter, not just revenue [00:44:59 | 00:45:00]. Young people should ask about key SaaS metrics like burn multiple, growth rate, gross margin, and return on customer acquisition cost (CAC) when considering joining a startup [00:45:24 | 00:45:25 | 00:45:27 | 00:45:28 | 00:45:30 | 00:45:32 | 00:45:33 | 00:45:37 | 00:45:39 | 00:45:40 | 00:45:42 | 00:45:44 | 00:45:45]. Aim to join companies that are in the "excellent" bracket based on these metrics, not the "unfundable" ones [00:45:49 | 00:45:51 | 00:45:53 | 00:45:56].

## Qualities of a Great Leader
Ben believes a crucial quality for a great leader and [[execution_and_leadership_in_startups | entrepreneurship]] is "vision" [00:47:49 | 00:47:52]. This involves clearly seeing the product in your mind's eye, understanding what you're building, why it works, and ensuring there's sufficient market demand [00:47:58 | 00:48:00 | 00:48:02 | 00:48:07 | 00:48:08 | 00:48:10 | 00:48:12 | 00:48:14 | 00:48:16 | 00:48:17 | 00:48:21 | 00:48:22 | 00:48:24 | 00:48:26]. He considers this ability a "gift" and feels lucky to have applied it multiple times [00:48:27 | 00:48:30 | 00:48:34 | 00:48:36].

## A Startup Idea: Remote Social
Ben envisions a social network for remote employees, tentatively named "Remote Social," to address the missing social aspect of work [00:48:45 | 00:48:46 | 00:48:48 | 00:48:50 | 00:48:52 | 00:48:55 | 00:48:56 | 00:48:58 | 00:48:59 | 00:49:00]. This platform would connect remote workers within geographic boundaries, facilitating in-person social events like Friday night drinks [00:49:02 | 00:49:04 | 00:49:05 | 00:49:07 | 00:49:09 | 00:49:11 | 00:49:14]. He believes it would be easy to connect people and could potentially generate revenue by partnering with venues [00:49:02 | 00:49:04 | 00:49:05 | 00:49:07 | 0:49:09 | 00:49:11].

## Personal Reflections
Ben is a husband and father of three, and his wife shares responsibilities, with him being the "boss outside of the house" and her being the "boss at home" [00:01:37 | 00:01:39 | 00:01:41 | 00:01:43 | 00:01:44 | 00:01:47 | 00:01:49 | 00:01:53 | 00:01:55]. He enjoys sailing and is a proud Northern Beaches native who rarely leaves the area, working remotely full-time for the last two and a half years [00:02:01 | 00:02:03 | 00:02:05 | 00:02:07 | 00:02:09 | 00:02:12 | 00:02:14 | 00:02:16 | 00:02:19 | 00:02:20]. He also states that his business is his hobby, spending "a ridiculous amount of time working on [his] hobby," which feels like "playing with [his] Legos and building things and having fun" [00:02:32 | 00:02:34 | 00:02:36 | 00:02:38 | 00:02:41 | 00:02:43 | 00:02:45].

A crazy moment from his adventures was proposing to his wife at the top of Tharpu Chuli, a 6,500-meter mountain in Nepal [00:49:21 | 00:49:23 | 00:49:26 | 00:49:27 | 00:49:31 | 00:49:34]. He soloed it with a sherpa, took a photo with a "Will you marry me" sign, and then immediately had to descend due to altitude sickness [00:49:36 | 00:49:37 | 00:49:40 | 00:49:41 | 00:49:45 | 00:49:47 | 00:49:50 | 00:49:52 | 00:49:54 | 00:49:56 | 00:49:58].

He finds space exploration inspiring, particularly watching SpaceX and the community of "nerds" tracking the construction of Starship, which represents pushing the edge of physics to make humans multi-planetary [00:50:16 | 00:50:18 | 00:50:21 | 00:50:24 | 00:50:26 | 00:50:30 | 00:50:32 | 00:50:35 | 00:50:37 | 00:50:39 | 00:50:44 | 00:50:46 | 00:50:48 | 00:50:50 | 00:50:52 | 00:50:54 | 00:50:56 | 00:51:00 | 00:51:02 | 00:51:04 | 00:51:06 | 00:51:09].

His yacht is named "Alliance" mirroring the name he gives to his group of companies, which include Employment Hero, Power to Motivate, KeyPay, and Employment Innovations [00:51:14 | 00:51:17 | 00:51:21 | 00:51:23 | 00:51:25 | 00:51:26 | 00:51:28 | 00:51:31 | 00:51:33]. This alliance encourages movement between companies and is a brand he considered for a future startup fund [00:51:35 | 00:51:37 | 00:51:38 | 00:51:42 | 00:51:44 | 00:51:48 | 00:51:50 | 00:51:52 | 00:51:54 | 00:51:55].

This article explores the experiences and insights of Max Martian, a founder, and Sachin, a venture capital (VC) associate, offering perspectives on their respective roles, personal growth, and philosophies.

## Introduction to Max Martian and Sachin
Max Martian is a founder currently building a company in stealth mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. He is also the founder of the investment syndicate Ultraviolet and Next Chapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Prior to this, he completed internships, notably with Goldman Sachs, and studied finance at university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Max is seen by many in the [[founder_experiences_and_strategies_in_tech_startups | startup]] world as someone destined to build an incredible company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

Sachin recently started a new role at AirTree, one of Australia's largest VCs, which has invested in multiple unicorns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>. He joined AirTree through a less conventional path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:11">[01:10:11]</a>.

The discussion also features insights from a sponsor, Recess, a furniture [[founder_experiences_and_strategies_in_tech_startups | startup]] that provides home and office furniture and has supported thousands of Aussie startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Evolution of Beliefs and Goals

### Max's Hundred-Year Goals and Life Philosophy
Max shares that a profound belief shift occurred during his five months in San Francisco, leading him to re-evaluate his life's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. He set "100-year goals," aiming to work on something that truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. His two main goals are to create a new city or rebuild healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The healthcare goal is personally meaningful due to a 10-year period of misdiagnosis he experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

He highlights the importance of "Mata versus Mana" (what someone says versus how they say it), noting that in San Francisco, there's a convention of pausing and thinking deeply before giving a concise, meaningful reply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This contrasts with the Australian startup scene's bias towards quick, articulate responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Max also realized that successful founders of unicorn companies are fundamentally similar to anyone else; they simply took risks and acted on contrarian views of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

On city building, Max believes many cities aren't optimized for quality of life, mental health, human connection, or innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. He's interested in applying principles like the golden ratio in design, as ancient Italian architects did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. While open to city building, his current focus is on healthcare, recognizing the difficulty of pursuing two bold 100-year goals simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Max attributes his personal growth to two factors:
1.  **Explore-exploit idea**: First exploring many things, then doubling down on what truly resonates and where one excels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
2.  **Overcoming mimetic desire**: Moving from copying others' desires and definitions of "good" to understanding what he intrinsically believes matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## Life as a Founder (Max's Perspective)

Max finds his life as a founder rewarding because he can work in a way that aligns with his natural inclinations, something that was penalized in traditional environments like high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.

### Daily Schedule and Productivity
His typical day involves waking around 8 AM, scheduling an 8:30 AM call to force himself out of bed, and working until midnight or 1 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. This schedule includes breaks for lunch, dinner, and daily 20-minute exercise sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. He prioritizes **moving the needle** every day rather than just being busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>. He tracks his hours and daily accomplishments to ensure productive output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:27">[00:59:27]</a>.

### Challenging Dogma
Max actively dislikes dogma, particularly around founding companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.
*   **Stealth Mode**: He explains three reasons for building in stealth mode: better narrative control, more frequent pivoting without narrative changes, and managing competitive risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:33">[01:01:33]</a>.
*   **Speed**: He believes one doesn't need to be prematurely fast in defining the very specific idea, as premature optimization can be detrimental, especially in healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Industry**: Max criticizes the healthcare industry for a lack of product innovation, often focusing instead on financial innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:33">[01:02:33]</a>.

### Decision-Making and Self-Awareness
Max continually refines a list of hypotheses, determining which is most critical to validate and who on the team is best suited to validate it quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>. This contrasts with a "Lean Startup" approach, as he knows what the 10-20-30 year future should look like and is focused on the right path to get there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>.

A key learning for Max is the need to manage how he communicates with his team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. While he is comfortable with uncertainty and delayed gratification, employees typically are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. Founders need to provide clarity and direction, which is why hiring too early before a clear vision is set can be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

One of his strengths is processing large amounts of data quickly to arrive at conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>. However, a weakness is sometimes failing to articulate the steps to reach that conclusion, making it hard for others to follow his reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.

His biggest accelerant has been realizing that **being himself is a superpower** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>. He now expresses his beliefs, learnings, and personality authentically, embracing polarization rather than trying to please everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>.

## Life as a Venture Capitalist (Sachin's Perspective)

Sachin finds his role at AirTree similar to podcasting, emphasizing the importance of asking quality questions rather than giving unsolicited advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>.

### Analytical Rigor and Empathy
He highlights that the analytical side of venture capital, such as financial modeling, is crucial for understanding the true drivers of a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Sachin believes that top VCs in the coming decades will have undergone rigorous training in financial analysis, similar to a "Bill Gurley style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>.

A key element for Sachin is **empathy with founders** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a>. His experience helping his father with a disability tech startup, including the financial struggles and emotional toll, built a crucial foundation of understanding what it's like to build a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:40">[01:16:40]</a>. This empathy is vital for the role, and he believes others should join a [[founder_experiences_and_strategies_in_tech_startups | startup]] before entering [[venture_capital_and_angel_investing | VC]] to build it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:33">[01:23:33]</a>.

### The Role of Advice and Feedback
Sachin believes associates should not give advice based on insecurity, but feedback and observations, especially derived from pattern matching across many companies, are valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>. He distinguishes between feedback (lower ego) and advice (potentially driven by insecurity or a desire to appear competent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. The best advice often comes in the form of thought-provoking questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>.

He acknowledges that an associate joining a VC fund will experience imposter syndrome, which he considers "so healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>. This helps maintain respect for founders, who are taking significant risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:40">[01:14:40]</a>.

### Niceness, Style, and Brand Building
Sachin discusses the "niceness" debate in VC, particularly concerning NPS quizzes for associates. He believes that every individual in [[building_and_managing_a_venture_capital_fund | venture capital]] must craft their own authentic style, as there is no universal rulebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>. He strives to be blunt but low ego in his feedback, clearly stating the fund's thesis and why they might pass, while acknowledging their limited perspective compared to a founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>.

To excel in the long term, Sachin focuses on:
1.  **Meeting good companies**: Building a strong personal brand, like a podcast, helps attract inbound deal flow, scaling better than constant outbound outreach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:14">[01:21:14]</a>. Deep knowledge in specific areas (e.g., Biotech, Health, Consumer, Climate) also helps in identifying opportunities and forming theses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>.
2.  **Making good decisions**: This comes from "doing the reps" and learning from smart people in the room over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>. He feels fortunate to have joined [[venture_capital_and_angel_investing | VC]] when analytical rigor is valued more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a>.

He emphasizes that the job requires an intrinsic love for technology and startups, otherwise, it can be very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:37">[01:23:37]</a>.

## Shared Insights and Philosophies

### Risk-Taking and Conviction
Both Max and Sachin discuss the importance of risk-taking and conviction. Max believes people are often not rewarded for taking risks in the school system, which promotes conformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:28">[02:25:28]</a>. He advocates putting "skin in the game" to test one's conviction, whether in markets or life decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:07">[02:27:07]</a>. He now assigns a conviction rating (low, medium, high) to his views to help others understand his commitment and openness to challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:05">[02:35:05]</a>.

Sachin adds that high IQ or knowledge doesn't automatically equate to conviction; it's the bold risk-takers who have clarity and certainty to focus on one thing that drive significant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:15">[02:41:15]</a>.

### Creativity and Authenticity
Adam believes everyone has something unique to share and should lean into their creative side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:07">[02:37:07]</a>. He defines creation broadly, from writing and podcasting to building companies, events, and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:57">[02:38:57]</a>. He sees building a company as the "upper tier of creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:57">[02:39:57]</a>. His shift towards creating more stems from a desire to put something new into the world, rather than just consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:10">[02:49:10]</a>.

Max agrees that creativity, like risk-taking, is often "beaten out of people" by systems like school, which categorize individuals as "creatives" or "non-creatives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:55">[02:55:55]</a>. He broadens the definition of "creator" to include expressing one's authentic self and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:53">[02:53:53]</a>.

### Growth Curves and Identifying Talent
Max defines talent across three vectors:
*   **Distance**: How much someone has done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:19">[03:19:19]</a>.
*   **Growth**: How fast someone is growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:31">[03:22:31]</a>.
*   **Acceleration**: Growing at an increasing rate (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8 units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:55">[03:24:55]</a>.

He emphasizes looking for acceleration in individuals, typically driven by **curiosity** (people who read, question everything) and **drive** (willingness to work hard, high stamina) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:16">[03:52:16]</a>. When hiring, a balance is needed between people with "acceleration" (potential) and "distance" (experience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:16">[03:59:16]</a>.

Sachin adds three key elements for accelerating growth:
1.  **Velocity**: Acting quickly and embracing fast feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:41">[05:32:41]</a>.
2.  **Boldness**: Taking risky actions beyond typical activities, such as reaching out to influential people or publishing publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:46">[05:35:46]</a>.
3.  **Reflection**: Independent thinking that leads to authenticity and prevents copying others' ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:23">[05:38:23]</a>.

Max notes that reflection should come first to ensure actions align with personal desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:45">[05:43:45]</a>, while Sachin suggests velocity might come first for those unsure of their passions, to explore different areas quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:54">[05:50:54]</a>. They caution against replacing genuine learning and upskilling with excessive networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:55">[05:53:55]</a>.

### Moats and Monopoly Building
Max discusses the concept of moats in businesses, particularly Peter Thiel's focus on natural monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>. He believes the only two moats that continually scale in the margin are:
1.  **Economies of Scale**: Producing something cheaper and at higher quality than competitors (e.g., Tesla, Nvidia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:30">[01:26:30]</a>. He views technological moats as eventually evolving into economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a>.
2.  **Network Effects**: Where the value of a product or service increases as more users join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:38">[01:26:38]</a>.

He expresses skepticism about Australian companies having strong moats, citing Canva's primary moat as brand rather than technological defensibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>.

> [!INFO] Summary of Core Philosophies
> *   **Max**: Focus on 100-year goals, value substance over style, embrace authentic self, prioritize impact over busyness, challenge dogma, and build conviction through action.
> *   **Sachin**: Prioritize asking good questions, build empathy with founders, leverage analytical skills, craft an authentic personal style, and intrinsically love the technology and [[founder_experiences_and_strategies_in_tech_startups | startup]] ecosystem.
> *   **Shared**: Value risk-taking, authenticity, continuous learning, and strategic decision-making in the context of long-term goals.

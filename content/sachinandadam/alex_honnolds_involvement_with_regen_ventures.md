Alex Honnold, one of the world's best climbers of all time and star of the movie *Free Solo* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, serves as an advisor to the Australian venture capital firm, Regen Ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. He met the team at an event in New York during Climate Week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Transition to Climate Investing

Honnold's involvement in nature and climate investing stems from a natural overlap with rock climbing, an activity that keeps him outside all the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. His appreciation for nature, derived from climbing and being outdoors, led to his work through the Honnold Foundation, which supports solar projects globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. He is personally interested and curious about environmental issues, having read extensively on environmental non-fiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. He enjoys meeting founders and individuals who are actively working to solve problems in this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Role and Contribution to Regen Ventures

While Honnold doesn't see himself as "advising anything in particular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, he believes that lessons from climbing, such as tackling big challenges, managing risk, and preparing well, can translate to other fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. He has dedicated 29 years to mastering his craft as a climber, and he suggests that the pursuit of one thing for such a long period can apply to any field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

What attracted Honnold to Regen Ventures is the inspiring name "Regeneration," as the company actively supports initiatives that make the world better, not just about making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. He believes that ideally, every company should be regenerative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

His primary passion within climate is solar and the broader energy transition to renewable energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. He also appreciates hearing from founders who are passionate about their specific niches, even learning about topics like seagrass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Current and Future Focus

Honnold views his involvement with the Honnold Foundation and Regen Ventures as sufficient for his climate participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. His main priority remains being the best climber he can be and taking on new climbing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, in addition to his family commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Lessons from Climbing: Fear and Preparation

A common misconception about Alex Honnold is that he feels no fear or doesn't care when climbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. He clarifies that his achievements come from a lifetime of training, practicing, and preparing, coupled with careful project selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

He explains that while practice can help manage fear, the better approach in rock climbing is to prepare so thoroughly that the fear isn't felt at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This preparation leads to 100% confidence, making the task no longer scary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This philosophy translates to a valuable lesson: more preparation leads to better outcomes, even when facing risk and fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Advice for Climate Founders

For young Australian founders interested in the climate sector, Honnold's primary advice is to "just do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

> "If you have a good idea, act on it. I mean, the worst thing that'll happen is that you fail, but you will have learned quite a bit from it and you'll do it again with a different company and you'll do it better in the future." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>

He suggests that the worst outcome is to not start at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. While acknowledging that failure isn't celebrated, he emphasizes that it's permissible to try again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. He concludes that in the long run, only successful ventures and personal contributions will be remembered, encouraging young, passionate individuals to "do the thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

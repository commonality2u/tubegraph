A new space race is currently underway, involving the US government, Western adversaries, and private entities like Elon Musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This race is characterized by a dramatic increase in the number of satellites in orbit and growing instances of countries spying on each other in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Global Satellite Boom
Unlike the 1960s Space Race, which focused on missions like the Apollo Moon landing, this modern competition involves various actors launching satellites for diverse reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The number of objects launched into Earth orbit remained relatively stagnant between 1965 and 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. However, this number began to rise dramatically, with over 2,600 objects launched into space annually by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

In recent years, the number of active satellites in space has grown from approximately 3,000 to an anticipated 100,000 within the next seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This surge is largely attributed to:
*   **Cheaper Launches**: Increased accessibility to space due to more affordable launch services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Commercial Companies**: Private entities like SpaceX and other launch companies are driving this trend, with technology transfer also occurring in countries like China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Academic Involvement**: Academia is increasingly entering space with research-oriented projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### The Impact of Geopolitics
The [[impact_of_geopolitics_on_space_collaboration | terrestrial politics]] are now transforming the space environment, shifting it from a historically collaborative domain to one of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Initiatives like the International Space Station, which fostered cooperation among former adversaries like the US and Russia, are being displaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This reflects rising global powers and emerging new relationships and blocks, leading to a drive for dominance in space mirroring events on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Challenges Posed by the Satellite Boom
The proliferation of satellites introduces several challenges:
*   **Space Debris**: An increasing volume of non-operational satellites and debris poses risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Organizations like Heo help track debris or defunct satellites, advocating for their deorbiting, preferably over uninhabited areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   *Examples*: A house in Florida was partially destroyed by a battery from the International Space Station earlier this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Two years prior, a large piece of SpaceX debris fell onto a farmer's land in Australia, landing hundreds of meters from his front door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Maintenance**: Ensuring the continued operation and health of orbiting assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Spying**: Governments are attempting to spy on each other in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Heo: An Australian Startup's Critical Role
Heo, a small Australian startup, plays a critical [[role_of_startups_in_space_surveillance_and_satellite_monitoring | role in helping Western allies]] navigate this new space race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. They specialize in making cameras and sensors for satellites, enabling governments and companies to monitor activities in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Heo's mission is to make space transparent, aiming to image anything in the solar system on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This transparency is crucial because a lack of it can be exploited by malicious actors, potentially creating conflict on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

### Business Model and Evolution
Heo, co-founded by Will and HJ, initially started as an asteroid mining company in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Two years later, they pivoted, recognizing the significant market for imaging and servicing other satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The technology they developed for asteroid imaging was directly transferable to satellite imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

Heo operates as both a hardware and software company, which provides a strong competitive advantage and attracts investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Their primary offering is a subscription to their software, providing analytics and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. To generate this data, they build and either sell or operate their own sensors (cameras) in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. They sell images and analytics to a range of commercial and government customers, including the Australian Space Agency, UK Space Agency, and national security agencies in the US, Japan, Australia, and the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Technology and Operations
Heo's lab in Botney, Sydney, serves as their primary facility for building cameras that go on spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. They have several cameras already in space, with more planned for launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. They also rent out other people's cameras in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Key aspects of their hardware and software development include:
*   **Optics Alignment**: Using lasers and mirrors to optimize the performance of their optical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Clean Environment Assembly**: Most optics assembly takes place in a clean environment, using a laminar flow cabinet to prevent dust contamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Cameras**:
    *   **Holmes Camera**: A smaller camera, first launched in June 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
    *   **Larger Telescope**: A bigger telescope, with the first unit expected to launch in the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Software Analysis**: Complex software analyzes footage from cameras and sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
    *   **Image Capture**: Satellites take images in bands over a 2-3 second period, with specific exposure and frame rates, to capture target satellites as they pass by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
    *   **AI and Image Enhancement**: Heo utilizes AI to search through datasets, locate target satellites, and enhance images before delivering them to customers with insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Their R&D focuses on optimizing camera usage (considering factors like imaging distance, velocity, and lighting) and applying post-processing to improve image quality for better decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

## [[regulatory_and_competitive_landscape_in_the_space_industry | Regulatory and Competitive Landscape]]
Despite Heo's significant [[the_future_of_tech_jobs_and_startup_funding | funding]] and industry tailwinds, the sensitive nature of the space industry and its ties to government contracts mean that regulatory changes can have a substantial impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

For instance, US monopoly laws previously prevented US companies from entering the market that Heo operated in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Heo was surprised that no one else was doing non-Earth imaging when they started, only to discover that the US had been keeping it secret for 60 years and had regulations to prevent US companies from doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

However, Heo's activities in Australia triggered a change in this US law approximately 18 months ago, opening the market to other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Being a first-mover provided Heo with a significant advantage, as competitors are only now starting to bring products to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Heo views this regulatory change as an opportunity, allowing them to partner with US companies that were previously prohibited from engaging in this type of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Their model of renting time on other satellites and monetizing their downtime allows them to integrate US sensors that were previously inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

## [[predicting_future_trends_in_society_space_art_and_technology | Future Trends]]
Heo anticipates that space will become a more transparent place in the next five years, with Heo playing a significant role in this transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. Their technological and business developments are geared towards achieving this future state of non-Earth imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

The expansion of the space industry and companies like Heo highlights the increasing [[social_impact_and_innovation_in_emerging_technologies | role space will have in everyday lives]], from providing internet connectivity to reducing the need for terrestrial infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Australian technology companies are playing an increasing and impactful role in this expanding industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

Blackbird Ventures is an Australian venture capital fund co-founded by Niki Scevak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It is recognized as one of the most well-known Australian venture capital funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> and is almost seen as the "godfather" of the VC world in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Blackbird Ventures and Startmate have collectively created over $10 billion worth of value with their portfolio companies combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Core Philosophy and Approach

Niki Scevak describes himself as a curious person who loves learning and reading, often piecing together elements of history and different industries into lessons or frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This curiosity extends to understanding human psychology, which he deems crucial for investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. He emphasizes the psychological aspects of markets, where emotions can lead investors to do the opposite of what is rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Scevak suggests training oneself to buy more when things go down, rather than selling, as things thought to be true generally remain true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

A key contributing factor to the success of both Startmate and Blackbird is "taking a chance on the hungry, not the proven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This philosophy suggests that change is brought about by outsiders and hungry people with no prior business experience, rather than privileged insiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

Scevak's insights are influenced by thinkers like [[key_investments_and_experiences_in_venture_capital | Charlie Munger]] and Danny Kahneman, particularly in understanding behavioral biases and mental models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. He values Munger's emphasis on being widely read across different fields to assemble lessons that apply to the investing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Psychology, human nature, and history (especially observing where ambitious people spend their time across different eras) are considered crucial domains for an investor's understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Blackbird's Investment Strategy

Blackbird's strategy is described as an "all-in bet on Australia and New Zealand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>, aiming to help these regions produce "gold medalist businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. The firm measures itself against being the best venture capital firm in the world, not just Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.

A core tenet of Blackbird's [[venture_capital_perspectives_and_founderfirst_investing | venture capital perspectives and founder-first investing]] is its configuration around the *company* rather than the *round* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. This contrasts with the traditional VC industry, which is often segmented by rounds (seed funds investing in seed, growth funds in growth, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

### Power Law and Long-Term Ownership
Blackbird operates on the principle that venture capital is a [[key_investments_and_experiences_in_venture_capital | power law]] business, where outlier companies account for the majority of returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. For example, Atlassian likely accounted for most Australian tech returns in the 2000s, and Canva is expected to do the same for the 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>.

Blackbird aims to invest right at the beginning, often before a company has revenue or even a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. Their first investment in Canva, for instance, was $250,000 before revenue or product, and they have since invested $270 million into the company, with intentions to invest hundreds of millions more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.

Blackbird wants to own "generational companies over many different decades" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>. While traditional venture capital funds are structured as 10-year vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>, Blackbird seeks to maintain its involvement even after companies go public, rather than ceding expertise to public fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. This desire for [[longterm_perspectives_on_venture_capital_and_business_growth | long-term perspectives on venture capital and business growth]] and ownership means they are exploring different structures to allow investors to continue ownership through Blackbird vehicles into the public life of a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.

## Building an Ecosystem

Blackbird co-founded Startmate, an accelerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>, which has started many brilliant companies and is expanding its brand through initiatives like the Startmate fellowship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

Community is central to Blackbird's identity and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. When Blackbird started, the concept of successful technology founders reinvesting and helping the next generation was largely absent in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. Blackbird brought together a founder community who supported their first fund and has continued to foster this community through their investments and Startmate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

### Maximizing the Rate of Learning
Blackbird encourages young individuals to prioritize maximizing their "rate of learning" over salary in their early careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Scevak states that founding a company offers tremendous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>, but joining a "scaling startup" (ideally between 20-200 employees, particularly after a Series A round) offers an even higher rate of learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. In such environments, individuals are given extensive opportunities and can be rapidly promoted due to the company's growth and trust built with founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

Some recommended scaling companies in Blackbird's portfolio include:
*   **Eucalyptus** (Sydney): Over 200 employees, rapidly scaled from under 40 in 12-18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
*   **Dovetail** (Sydney): Around 60 employees, rapidly expanding after raising capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
*   **Linktree** (Melbourne): Noted for its pure scale of customers rapidly pulling the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   **Zeller** (Melbourne): Similar to Linktree in its customer growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Blackbird aims to continue investing in brand and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. They plan more programs around helping people enhance their careers, find jobs, and connect with startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. The core of Blackbird's brand is "belief"â€”in ambitious people and their visions, particularly in the early, idea-stage investments that remain their bread and butter, despite growing fund sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>.

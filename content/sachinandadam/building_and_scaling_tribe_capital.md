[[Building and managing a venture capital fund | Tribe Capital]] is a data-driven venture capital firm co-founded by Jonathan Zhu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It is recognized as one of the first data-driven VC funds globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The firm manages multiple billions of dollars in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Origins and Founding Philosophy
Jonathan Zhu's background in physics and data science laid the foundation for [[Building and scaling Tribe Capital | Tribe Capital's]] unique approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. He holds a PhD in physics from Stanford and was among the first data scientists at Facebook in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This period, around 2008-2010, marked the "big data big bang," leading tech companies to hire PhDs to extract insights from vast amounts of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Data science as a term emerged from this era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Zhu's career has been driven by two main threads:
1.  **Data and Quantitative Methods**: Applying quantitative methods to understand businesses, drive product adoption, and analyze patterns of behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. His physics background, which he considers the "greatest quantitative model," fueled a desire to find models that work for running businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
2.  **Seeking White Space**: A desire to do things differently from others. Zhu pursued data science in its early days because it was an undefined, untouched area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This ethos carried over to venture capital, where he saw an opportunity to apply data analysis when no one else was doing so in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This personal philosophy is akin to the "blue ocean" strategy in business, focusing on uncontested markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

His time as a partner at Social Capital allowed him to bring these data-driven frameworks to the venture world, adapting them from social web companies like Facebook to various business models such as SaaS, payments, and the sharing economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. The decision to launch [[Building and scaling Tribe Capital | Tribe Capital]] stemmed from the belief that their data-driven approach was the future of investing, and it wouldn't survive within a traditional firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>.

## Tribe Capital's Data-Driven Investment Approach
[[Building and scaling Tribe Capital | Tribe Capital's]] unique approach combines quantitative rigor with traditional qualitative assessments:

*   **Firm Layer Integration**: The data work is integrated at the firm level, aiming to help as many founders as possible, even without investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   **Founder Feedback**: They provide quantitative benchmarks and feedback to founders approximately 400 times a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. This builds goodwill and access within the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   **Investment Process**:
    *   They first engage in a conversation to determine if sufficient data exists for analysis, particularly for companies beyond the pre-product stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
    *   Their focus is often on companies with $1 million to $10 million in revenue, which have significant data but still carry early-stage risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.
    *   After the initial data analysis, the firm transitions to a more traditional venture investing approach, considering factors like the founder, market, and team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
    *   Annually, they perform data work on about 400 companies, deep dive into roughly 70, and invest in around 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
*   **Analogy to Accounting**: Zhu compares their data science approach to Benjamin Graham's use of accounting for fundamental analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. Just as accounting provides a quantitative lens for understanding a business's current state, their frameworks offer a clear-headed way to discuss a company's present and past, rather than solely predicting the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.
*   **[[Startup growth and investor dynamics | Product Market Fit]]**: They quantify and benchmark product market fit by focusing on customer acquisition (e.g., 1, 10, 100, 1000 customers) rather than calendar timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. Their method for analyzing unit economics is detailed on their website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.
*   **[[Building a successful tech startup | "God Mode"]]]**: Using data provides a unique advantage, allowing them to "see right through the company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
*   **Software System**: [[Building and scaling Tribe Capital | Tribe Capital]] has built a "giant software system" to enable comprehensive data analysis and deliver value to founders and LPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

## Challenges in [[Building and scaling Tribe Capital | Building and scaling Tribe Capital | Scaling Tribe Capital]]
The process of [[Building and managing a venture capital fund | raising Tribe Capital's first fund]] was very difficult, involving approximately 700 conversations with Limited Partners (LPs), a process exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>. Zhu notes that LPs tend to prefer existing, successful strategies, making it challenging to introduce a novel data-driven approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

## Identifying Talent
When hiring for [[Building and scaling Tribe Capital | Tribe Capital]], which is a small firm of 34 people, Jonathan Zhu prioritizes **flexibility** and **generalist** capabilities over highly specialized expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. In early-stage companies or investment firms, roles often shift, requiring individuals who can adapt and add value across different responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>. This preference for versatility aligns with his personal career philosophy of finding "white space" and avoiding one-dimensional pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.

## Notable Investments
[[Building and scaling Tribe Capital | Tribe Capital]] values investments where other people might have overlooked opportunities. One example is Docker, an older company that had undergone a recapitalization in 2019 or 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>. Despite the "baggage" and past losses associated with the company, Tribe Capital's data approach allowed them to discern its underlying value, leading to a successful investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

## Units of Atomic Value
Zhu's framework of "units of atomic value" explores new forms of value beyond traditional revenue or profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>:

*   **Engagement**: Originating from the Social Web era (e.g., Facebook), where engaged users were highly valued even without immediate revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.
*   **Gig Worker Time**: The value derived from the hours worked by gig economy participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.
*   **Compute Power**: As seen in crypto, where the ability to exercise compute on platforms like Ethereum could be a unit of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>.
*   **Personal Data**: The potential for individuals to capture value from their own personal data used on the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>.
*   **Training Data**: In the current AI landscape, training data may emerge as a key unit of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.
*   **Transactional Information**: In contexts like Indian e-commerce, as exemplified by Shiprocket, capturing the value in granular transactional information refactors existing infrastructure and unlocks new value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.

For investors, the interest lies in identifying these potential units of value and then seeing if companies can demonstrate widespread user adoption to prove their real-world impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.

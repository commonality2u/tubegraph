Emil Michael, former Chief Business Officer at Uber, is known for his role as a master negotiator who successfully raised billions of dollars for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. His approach to [[negotiation_skills_and_high_eq | negotiation]] and business development is characterized by a blend of high emotional intelligence (EQ), intellect (IQ), and a unique methodology.

## Defining Business Development vs. Sales

Michael distinguishes business development from traditional sales, stating that sales is about moving money from one pocket to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Business development, in his view, focuses on negotiating "win-win" deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. He emphasizes the ability to:
*   Make deals happen that should happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   Kill deals that shouldn't happen, saving everyone's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   Solve complex, hard situations by breaking down problems into their component parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Core Components of Negotiation

Michael identifies several "superpowers" crucial for effective negotiation:

### High EQ
The ability to understand the person on the other side of the table is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. This involves understanding their mind, heart, background, and even where they live and went to school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. This [[empathy_and_leadership_in_venture_capital | empathy]] stems from his own life experiences, including being an immigrant and receiving support from mentors like Bill Campbell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

### Intellect (IQ)
Beyond emotional understanding, it's essential to grasp the "math of how everyone wins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This involves analytical thinking to find mutually beneficial solutions.

### Active Listening
A unique characteristic of Michael's approach, especially given his intense nature, is his commitment to listening more than he talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. This allows him to:
*   Gather "the vibes" and information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   Understand word choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   Ask simple questions that draw out someone's personal or professional motivations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

He has spent years honing this skill, combining active listening with thorough research and studying the other party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

### Honesty and Transparency
In fundraising, Michael adopted a transparent approach, telling investors he would seek bids from many and take the second-best one to ensure the deal closed and was slightly oversubscribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. He would commit to giving all but the last party their full allocation, avoiding "games" or cutting back commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. This built trust, as he did exactly what he said he would do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

### Loyalty
Michael values loyalty to his team, friends, and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. He believes the depth of relationships developed over time, by being with people through hard and good times, is a source of pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This trait likely contributes to his ability to build [[networking_and_relationships_in_career_success | rapport]] and trust in negotiations.

## Application in Fundraising
While Uber operated in a "free money era" with strong product-market fit, Michael asserts that fundraising was still challenging due to the unprecedented sums being raised (six rounds in 20 months, growing from $350 million to $70 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. His transparent and honest approach helped navigate these intense periods.

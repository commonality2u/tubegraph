Abheek Anand, Managing Director at Peak 15 (formerly Sequoia Asia), shares his insights on [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | venture capital]], drawing from his diverse career as a co-founder, product manager at Facebook, and now a leading investor in Southeast Asia. His philosophy centers on understanding how things work, breaking down complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, and maintaining a long-term outlook in the dynamic world of startups and investments.

## The Driving Force: Problem Solving and Curiosity

Abheek Anand's career, spanning computer science, an MBA, technical product management, entrepreneurship, and [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | venture capital]], has been driven by a consistent core principle: trying to understand how things work and breaking down complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. This approach, honed during his computer science studies, involves simplifying intricate systems into composable elements to find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

Investing, for Anand, is a different kind of problem-solvingâ€”it's about anticipating the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. He views investing as a blend of art and science, requiring both creativity and imagination grounded in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. This combination of analytical thinking and creativity is also characteristic of the best founders, who possess an insatiable curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>.

Anand's deep curiosity developed from a young age, growing up in India where education was seen as the primary path to social mobility amidst resource constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:02]</a>. This environment fostered a drive to leverage his strengths in problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. He notes that many successful founders, particularly immigrants, bring a similar drive from humble beginnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

He highlights the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) as institutions that foster brilliant minds due to their rigorous meritocratic selection process and the virtuous cycle of aspiring to role models among alumni <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. While not a 16-hour-a-day student himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>, his experience managing computer networks at IIT provided valuable out-of-classroom learning and fostered a "hacker mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

## Manufacturing Luck and the Bay Area Mindset

Abheek Anand subscribes to the philosophy that the smartest people have an uncanny ability to "manufacture luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>. He believes luck can be manufactured by being in places of significant activity and surrounding oneself with intelligent, motivated individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. Living in San Francisco, the "epicenter of the startup world," allowed him to meet his co-founder and engage in serendipitous conversations that led to opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

This environment fosters a comfort with taking risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. He emphasizes the power of compounding, which becomes more impactful if one takes risks in the early days to change the trajectory of their career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>.

The Bay Area, particularly during his time at Stanford for his MBA, embodied a culture of creativity and a "builder mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>. This environment, where not starting a company after graduation felt like "letting your cohort down," fostered an entrepreneurial spirit and a desire for outsized impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>.

## Transition to Venture Capital

Anand's own entrepreneurial journey included co-founding Tactile, which was later acquired by Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:47:00">[21:47:00]</a>. He found that the biggest risk of entrepreneurship is that it makes one "constitutionally unemployable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:00">[21:55:00]</a>, leading to a strong desire to continue engaging in entrepreneurial journeys. While an investor is on the other side of the table, they still participate in this journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>.

His time at Facebook before its IPO was characterized by a mission-driven organization with smart people aligned behind its goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:02]</a>. He learned the importance of playing "the long game" and prioritizing product over short-term revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>. Despite valuing the experience, he realized he was "not cut out for big company life" and preferred working in smaller teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:04:00]</a>.

Joining Sequoia (now Peak 15) was not initially on his career path, as he always thought he'd return to founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:00]</a>. However, the firm's culture, particularly its emphasis on endurance and playing the long game, resonated deeply with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:48:00">[25:48:00]</a>. Decisions are made with long-term value creation in mind, even if short-term sub-optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30:00">[26:30:00]</a>. The firm's limited partners (LPs), often non-profits with centuries-long histories, further reinforce this long-term mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:12:00">[27:12:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Strategies in Venture Investing

The biggest challenge in [[Challenges and strategies in venture investing | venture investing]] is the extremely long feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:36:00">[29:36:00]</a>. Investors make decisions whose outcomes may not be known for months or even years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>. This forces a maniacal focus on the very long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>. Unlike founders who receive daily or weekly feedback, investors must calibrate their operating rhythm to this delayed gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:38:00">[30:38:00]</a>.

A key learning from [[Key investments and experiences in venture capital | investment experiences]] like Appier (a software company that went from early stage to IPO) is the need for patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:19:00">[31:19:00]</a>. The only controllable factors at the outset are being in the "right neighborhood" and backing the "right people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:03:00">[32:03:00]</a>.

## Geographic Expansion and Global Ambitions

Anand moved to Asia to be part of the "Asia story," initially focusing on India and then expanding to Singapore to cover Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>. Peak 15's strategy involves building an Asia-wide franchise, partnering with founders at early stages regardless of their location, and being present in main hubs like Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:47:00">[33:47:00]</a>.

A core thesis for Peak 15 is that the best founders globally are incredibly ambitious and want to build global or regional businesses, not just market-specific ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:32:00">[34:32:00]</a>. The firm aims to help companies expand and fulfill these global ambitions through various programs and specialist teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:07:00">[35:07:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Investment Mentality and Business Growth

Over 10 years, Anand has observed a significant change in the scale of outcomes in tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:15:00">[36:15:00]</a>. The "nice round number" for revenue (net revenue or gross margin) that investors considered a decade ago was $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:43:00">[36:43:00]</a>. Now, that number has expanded to $250 million or even $500 million, reflecting deeper tech markets, increased founder ambition, and growing company sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55:00">[36:55:00]</a>. This points to a core belief that the tech market is not only expanding but its rate of expansion is increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:15:00">[37:15:00]</a>.

## Cultivating Long-Term Talent in Venture Capital

Peak 15 adopts a long-term approach to talent development, with eight of its eleven partners having started their careers at the firm as analysts or associates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:21:00">[38:21:00]</a>. Anand advises young hires to view their role not as a "next job" but as a "last job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:44:00">[38:44:00]</a>, emphasizing the compounding impact of a long career at one platform and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:09:00">[39:09:00]</a>.

To accelerate growth, young venture professionals should focus on their strengths, avoid trying to do everything, and become experts in a particular area, mirroring how startups find success with a "wedge" product before expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:51:00">[40:51:00]</a>.

## Current Excitement: AI and FinTech

Anand is particularly excited about two major sectors: software and fintech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:11:00">[42:11:00]</a>.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
He sees AI as a potentially massive inflection point, similar to mobile and cloud a decade ago, that will reimagine significant portions of global software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:49:00">[42:49:00]</a>. He draws parallels to the cloud thesis of moving on-premise software to the cloud, suggesting a "multi-trillion dollars of software revenue that can potentially be reimagined" by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:21:00">[43:21:00]</a>. While the hype cycle is ongoing, AI is a "multi-decade trend" that offers fascinating opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:00:00">[44:00:00]</a>.

### FinTech
FinTech is a significant focus across multiple markets, despite regional differences in consumer and business needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:00:00">[45:00:00]</a>. Anand finds the disparity in the sophistication and availability of financial services across markets fascinating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:31:00">[45:31:00]</a>. He believes that bringing everyone to "parity" in access to high-quality services presents an incredible opportunity in each market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:43:00">[45:43:00]</a>. A global perspective helps identify these "white spaces" and generate interesting opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:05:00">[46:05:00]</a>.

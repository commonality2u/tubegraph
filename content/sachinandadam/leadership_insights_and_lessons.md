Adam Powick, the CEO of the Australian division of Deloitte, provides profound [[leadership_lessons_and_company_building_in_the_tech_industry | leadership insights]] gleaned from his extensive career within one of the world's largest professional services organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. His approach to leadership and career development deviates from conventional wisdom, emphasizing authenticity, continuous learning, and adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Personal Background and Early Influences

Growing up in a working-class area of Melbourne, Adam describes himself as a "knock about lad" and a "complete larrikin" in his youth, often finding himself in the principal's office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. His parents were his primary inspiration, fostering curiosity and the freedom to explore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. He pursued an obscure degree in aeronautical engineering at RMIT, then considered a "third tier" institution known as the "working man's college" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

Adam candidly admits he never had a rigid career plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. His philosophy revolved around constantly learning new things and committing fully to any endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

> "All I've done is try to learn new things and if I have a go at something, I have a real go at it. I don't muck around. I have a real shot at it, try to be the best I can be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Defining Leadership

Adam distinguishes between management and leadership:
*   **Management** involves competently handling tasks, activities, or teams, doing what is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Leadership** goes beyond this; it involves improving processes, thinking forward, developing people within the team, and creating a legacy of continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Leaders challenge themselves and others to innovate and drive toward new outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## Key Principles of Leadership

### Conscious Decision and Courage
Becoming a leader requires a conscious decision and courage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Leaders must be prepared for criticism when making decisions and steering teams in new directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Adam himself took a long time, well into his 30s, to embrace being a leader due to an Australian cultural tendency to "throw rocks at leaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

### Curiosity and Innovation
Leaders must be intensely curious and committed to self-development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Stagnation is a warning sign to seek new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. They must be willing to innovate, as doing the same thing repeatedly is not leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

### Action and Outcomes
Actions speak louder than words in leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Leaders must make decisions, take action, and drive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Bringing People Along
A true leader brings people on the journey, listening, engaging, motivating, and encouraging them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

## [[authenticity_in_leadership | Authenticity in Leadership]] and Self-Perception

Adam strongly believes in [[authenticity_in_leadership | authenticity]], stating that "the only thing you can be best at in life is being yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. However, he cautions that authenticity must be coupled with self-development and understanding how one is perceived by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. His "larrikin" persona, while authentic, initially cost him promotions as it lacked perceived "gravitas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

> "How am I perceived? ...It's such a creative question and I didn't realize I was perceived as a joker, you know, good with people, pretty smart, you know, potential but a rough diamond, I didn't realize that." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>

He learned to manage his weaknesses, elevate his strengths, and surround himself with complementary capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Experiences like working in Asia Pacific forced him to moderate his blunt communication style and become more attentive to cultural differences, fostering personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

## [[life_lessons_for_future_leaders | Life Lessons for Future Leaders]]

### The Role Model Moment
A pivotal moment in one's career is realizing you've become a role model, where everything you say and do is observed and emulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. This brings a sense of responsibility and encourages more thoughtful conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. Becoming a father also profoundly impacted his sense of responsibility and wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

### Career Decisions and Adaptability
Adam advises against rigid career plans, as they limit opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Instead, focus on learning, taking opportunities (even seemingly boring ones), and constantly asking "Why?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. The most critical characteristic for long-term success is adaptability, especially given unexpected events like global pandemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.

### Building Networks
Adam emphasizes the paramount importance of building strong networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. He advocates treating everyone, "from the car park operator and the CEO, exactly the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. This natural, authentic approach to relationships, giving without immediate expectation of return, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. He can quickly spot transactional relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>.

### Continuous Learning from Failure
Adam believes those who succeed the most have failed the most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. He consistently learned from tough projects, engagements, and situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. He pursued an MBA to round out his skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a> and continues to learn about new topics like climate change, indigenous history, and the future of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

### Multiple Careers within One Organization
While Adam has spent most of his career at Deloitte, he views it as having had "15 different careers" due to diverse roles, global assignments, and constant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. He advises changing what you do every few years rather than constantly changing organizations, to leverage and grow your network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.

## Legacy and Fulfillment

For Adam, a good life and a proud legacy at age 80 would center on:
*   His family remaining close-knit and successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.
*   A vibrant network of friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
*   Most importantly, the people he has helped mentor and watched grow into leaders in their own right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. Developing people is his ultimate legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.

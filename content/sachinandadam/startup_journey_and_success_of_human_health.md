Human Health, co-founded by Georgia Vidler and Kate Lamberis, emerged from their shared experiences navigating the complexities of the healthcare system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The startup has garnered significant attention, notably by raising the largest pre-seed amount in Australian history for an all-female founding team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, totaling $10.15 million AUD in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This success highlights the widespread resonance of the problem Human Health aims to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Founding Motivation

The founders' personal [[founder_experiences_and_strategies_in_tech_startups | experiences]] with the healthcare system were the primary drivers behind Human Health.

Kate Lamberis's motivation stemmed from multiple family health crises:
*   Her mother's side of the family has a history of cancer, and she lost her mother to an aggressive form of lung cancer at age 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   Three years later, she lost her father to Parkinson's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   Crucially, her children's health struggles deeply impacted her. Her daughter began exhibiting concerning symptoms around 17-18 months old, leading to an autism diagnosis after months of waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Faced with limited options from doctors who suggested her daughter might live in an institution and never talk, Kate embarked on a journey of self-education to find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Her daughter now lives a perfectly normal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   During COVID-19, her son began to exhibit similar symptoms, reinforcing the need for better healthcare solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Kate felt compelled to seek solutions beyond what was readily available, realizing that staying home wouldn't help her son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

Georgia Vidler's personal [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_mindset | journey]] also shaped her commitment:
*   The loss of her father 2-3 months before joining Canva highlighted significant issues within the Australian health system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   Growing up, a large part of her family struggled with serious mental illnesses like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and manic depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   These experiences, combined with a desire to create something with purpose, led her to co-found Human Health with Kate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

The co-founders, who became close friends while working at Canva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, realized they shared a "stupidly large vision" to address the "huge gaping hole" in the healthcare ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## The Problem and Solution

Human Health aims to "unfuck the health industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The healthcare system is plagued by widespread issues, including misdiagnosis, slow processes, and a lack of new technology and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Personal stories of suffering from these issues are resonant across communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Human Health (now officially called Human Health) is a tool designed for patients and carers to:
*   Track symptoms and treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   Learn what's working for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   Share this information with providers to advocate for the care they deserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

The platform primarily serves individuals with chronic diagnoses, many of whom are tracking multiple conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

## Fundraising and Investor Confidence

Human Health achieved a significant milestone by raising Australia's largest pre-seed round for an all-female founder team, securing $10.15 million AUD in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This achievement attracted major investors such as AirTree, Skip Capital, and Dave Shane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

The [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_execution_and_marketing | fundraising process]] was a learning experience for the co-founders, who initially aimed to raise only from angels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Through numerous pitches, they refined their message, learning that while they had a very big vision, they couldn't always express its full extent immediately as it might "scare some people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

Investors like Dave and Alicia from AirTree cited the founders' "infectious absolute infectious attitude and passion," their domain expertise, and their big ambitions driven by personal experience as key reasons for their investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The founders' conviction that they "just couldn't not do this" problem-solving was also infectious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_goals_of_the_healthcare_startup_human_health | Challenges and Goals]]

Building HealthTech startups presents unique [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_culture | challenges and strategies in startup culture]]:

*   **Product Launch**: The initial launch of the product was a vulnerable moment, as it felt like only a "fraction of what we actually wanted to release" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. However, user feedback has made it a heartening experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Company Culture**: Kate and Georgia aimed to challenge the stereotype of demanding tech companies by creating a more compassionate environment where employees can bring their "whole selves to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This, however, proved difficult in practice, especially in recruiting individuals with both exceptional skill and the right aptitude for this culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Simplifying Medical Information**: A core challenge is translating complex medical concepts into an easily understandable format for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This involves thoughtful design choices like color theory within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   **Ethical Use of Technology**: The founders are cautious about using AI, adhering to the medical principle of "first do no harm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Their aim is to provide helpful, guiding information that truly aids users on their health journey without causing any harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Trust, Security, and Privacy**: Maintaining user trust is paramount. This includes rigorous security measures to protect data and strict privacy policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Human Health does not share or sell user data, nor does it show ads. Users maintain control over their data, with options for deletion and anonymization for metrics, complying with GDPR and HIPAA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

## Philosophy on Success and Leadership

The founders have a distinct philosophy on [[the_journey_and_mindset_of_being_a_visionary_and_an_entrepreneur | success]] and leadership:
*   **Complementary Skills**: Georgia learned from Kate that she doesn't "have to be good at everything" and can "lean into the things that I'm good at and lean out of the things that I just don't like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. Kate, who initially never wanted to be a founder, also felt the pressure to be good at everything but found strength in their partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   **Incremental Success**: They redefine success not as a distant destination but as the accumulation of successful days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.
    > "Your life is made up by the days that you live so if you had 10 years for all the company and every day of that 10 years was terrible then you win some award or you like hit some crazy number but what a waste of a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
    They focus on daily achievements and team well-being, believing that this approach ultimately leads to true success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   **Purpose Over Profit**: Both founders, influenced by their personal experiences with illness and loss, prioritize helping people over solely chasing financial milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Kate's personal goal is to remove the feeling of despair she experienced when her son was diagnosed for at least one other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. This deep-seated motivation is far more compelling than merely making investors wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

## Global Vision

Starting from an office in Surry Hills, Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, Human Health has begun expanding its product in the US and sees immense potential for global use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. The [[challenges_and_goals_of_the_healthcare_startup_human_health | challenges and goals of the healthcare startup Human Health]] remain focused on changing the future of health globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

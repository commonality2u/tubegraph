## Early Career and Strategic Connections
Malcolm Turnbull's early career as a journalist naturally facilitated [[importance_of_mentors_and_networks | meeting influential people]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. By covering state parliament, he connected with politicians, including Neville Wran, who later became a long-time business partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

While some connections were a direct result of his profession, others, like meeting Kerry Packer, happened serendipitously through mutual acquaintances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. These initial encounters often evolved into professional relationships, leading to opportunities like becoming Packer's lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

Turnbull emphasizes that his networking wasn't always a calculated strategy, but rather a natural development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Journalism, in particular, offers a unique advantage for young individuals to meet a wide array of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This concept also extends to modern platforms like podcasts, which aim to replicate the ability to connect with high-profile individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### The Significance of Luck and Serendipity

## Advice for Building Relationships and [[Maximizing career growth in startups | Career Growth]]

Malcolm Turnbull offers several pieces of advice for young people aiming to build effective relationships and progress in their careers:

    > "There is nothing more flattering to say to somebody explain something to me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
    Asking questions shows interest and a willingness to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Turnbull himself has always been an avid question-asker and note-taker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. When seeking information, he suggests finding the experts directly involved in the work, such as engineers rather than just chief executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

*   **Don't Be Afraid to Ask:**
    > "If you don't ask you don't get" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.
    Many people are easily discouraged by potential "knock-backs" or fear of rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. However, believing in oneself and being prepared to ask for opportunities, even if it means being "pushy" (without being offensive), is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

He advises young people to "listen more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>, as older, more experienced individuals often want to help and share their knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.

*   **Engage with People:**
    Turnbull encourages initiating conversations, even in everyday settings like public transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. A simple smile and introduction can lead to interesting conversations and learning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. He highlights the "social value of public transport" for facilitating serendipitous encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.

*   **Genuine Interest in People:**
    Turnbull states, "I like people a lot and I enjoy other people's company and I'm interested in them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. He suggests that enjoying interaction with others and listening to their stories is fundamental for success, especially in fields like politics, which are inherently "people businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

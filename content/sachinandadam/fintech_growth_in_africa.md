## Introduction
Azak is a pioneering [[The future impact of blockchain and fintech in emerging markets | fintech]] company based in Uganda, representing the first angel investment for hosts Sachin and Adam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Founded by Kevin, Azak focuses on [[Digital banking and lending models | digital banking and lending models]] in [[Challenges and opportunities in African economies | Africa]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Their primary offering includes lending money digitally for the purchase of motorbikes, fuel, and smartphone loans, with the ambition to become a full-stack [[Digital banking and lending models | digital bank]] across the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Driving Force Behind Azak
Kevin's personal motivation stems from his background as a US-born individual to Bangladeshi immigrant parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. He feels "extraordinarily lucky" for the opportunities he received, which many in his ancestral land did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This led him to study development economics, exploring what makes countries rich or poor and how to bridge that gap by bringing opportunities where they are most needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. His interest in [[Microfinance and its impact | microfinance]], pioneered in Bangladesh, further fueled his desire to use mobile technology to reinvent the industry, making it more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Kevin's ultimate drive is to "make money while also doing good," seeing a unique opportunity to share wealth and develop a country rather than just an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

## Insights from Microfinance
Kevin's experience interning with large [[Microfinance and its impact | microfinance]] institutions like BRAC and Grameen Bank in Bangladesh provided valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

### Advantages of the Microfinance Model
*   **Widespread Financial Infrastructure**: MFIs have successfully brought basic financial infrastructure to remote villages, often ignored by commercial banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **Underwriting Without Title Assets**: They pioneered methods to underwrite individuals who lack formal property titles, such as those whose only assets are livestock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. This is achieved through group guarantees, where community members vouch for each other's reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

### Areas for Improvement
*   **Efficiency**: The traditional model often required face-to-face meetings for payments or loan applications, leading to inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

## Understanding Poverty and Wealth Disparities
Kevin acknowledges the complexity of why some countries are rich and others are poor, but highlights a few key factors:

*   **Strength of Institutions**: Colonial history, for example, has impacted the strength of institutions in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. British common law tends to offer more security around property rights, encouraging asset accumulation and investment, compared to other legal systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.
*   **Geographical Luck**: Landlocked countries in [[Challenges and opportunities in African economies | Africa]] tend to have significantly lower growth rates than those with access to the sea, which facilitates cheaper imports and diverse industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

## Leapfrogging Innovation in East Africa
East Africa has demonstrated a unique ability to "leapfrog" outdated technologies seen in Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

*   **Mobile Technology Adoption**:
    *   Lack of existing landline infrastructure made it easier and cheaper to build cell phone towers, enabling widespread mobile phone access even in remote villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.
    *   Manufacturers developed cheaper handsets, making phones accessible to a broader population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.
    *   Innovations like purchasing airtime in small chunks (e.g., 10-50 cents) instead of monthly subscriptions further increased accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:41]</a>.
*   **Rise of Mobile Money**:
    *   Low adoption of formal financial systems: less than 5% of Ugandans have a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.
    *   Traditional banks are often inconvenient due to travel costs, unpredictable closing hours, and potential for bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.
    *   Kevin's anecdote about farmers preferring to "save" by buying pigs illustrates the practical challenges and lack of perceived value in traditional banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. Pigs are considered more "liquid" than cash because they are accessible, appreciate in value (eat grass and grow), and can be easily sold locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.
    *   Mobile money systems like M-Pesa offer instant transactions, proving more effective and foolproof for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.

## Breaking the Poverty Cycle Through Credit
Access to credit is crucial for unlocking opportunities and moving people out of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.

*   **Challenges to Saving**:
    *   **Cultural Reasons**: Many developing countries have communal societies with strong family networks, where individuals are expected to help relatives in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>. Money in a household doesn't sit long as it's often needed by someone in the extended network, functioning as a social safety net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Structural Reasons**: Banks are often inconvenient and unreliable, making traditional saving difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>.

*   **Impact of Credit**: Access to credit allows individuals to acquire productive assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. For example, a motorcycle taxi driver (boda driver) often spends 50% of their income on rental fees for a bike, preventing them from building equity or saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>. Ownership of an asset like a motorcycle immediately elevates their income and puts them on a different trajectory, allowing them to afford education, medicine, or safer housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39:00">[22:39:00]</a>. Azak's repayment rates of 96% demonstrate the willingness and ability of recipients to repay loans when given productive assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:00">[23:32:00]</a>.

## Azak's Evolution and Business Model
Azak was founded in June 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>. Kevin, initially volunteering with Engineers Without Borders, recognized that while farmers in Ugandan villages used mobile phones for digital payments, traditional banking was slow and paper-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>. This led to the idea of becoming Uganda's first digital lender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>.

### The Pivot from Cash to Asset-Backed Lending
*   **Initial Model**: Azak initially provided cash loans for various business purposes, such as agriculture or working capital for shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>.
*   **Challenge of Fungibility**: A key learning was the fungibility of cash in lower-middle-income households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>. Cash loans were often diverted to immediate personal needs like school fees or medical treatment, making repayment difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>. Some even used it for unproductive purposes like gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:58:00">[33:58:00]</a>.
*   **The Pivot**: Azak pivoted to "lending in kind," focusing on asset financing, specifically motorcycle loans for boda drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits of Asset-Backed Lending**:
    *   **Shared Risk**: Drivers make a down payment, ensuring they have "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>.
    *   **Guaranteed Productivity**: Motorcycles are inherently productive assets, used to earn money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Specialization**: Focusing on one industry (boda-boda) allows for deeper understanding and a smoother, systematic underwriting process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:22:00">[28:22:00]</a>.
    *   **Creating Collateral**: Instead of requiring pre-existing collateral, Azak creates security for the loan by installing a GPS tracker in the motorcycle and insuring it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:36:00">[29:36:00]</a>. This expands their market size by allowing access to credit for those without traditional assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>.

## Vision for a Full-Stack Digital Bank
Azak's vision is to become the largest [[Digital banking and lending models | digital bank]] in [[Challenges and opportunities in African economies | Africa]], acting as a conduit for trillions of dollars of [[Investment in technology and emerging markets | investment]] into the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:00">[25:10:00]</a>.

### Scalability and Business for Impact
*   **For-Profit Model**: Azak consciously chose a for-profit structure because it allows for greater scalability and sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[24:58:00]</a>. Unlike philanthropy, a business solution can sustain itself for hundreds of years, attracting investment by demonstrating higher returns in [[Challenges and opportunities in African economies | Africa]] while creating jobs and doubling incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:31:00">[25:31:00]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity**: [[Challenges and opportunities in African economies | Africa]] is home to billions of people coming online and will have the largest working-class population for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:23:00">[26:23:00]</a>. Investing in basic and essential services in such a market is inherently impactful and commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:51:00">[26:51:00]</a>.

### Growth Strategy and Technological Edge
*   **Strategic Partnerships**: Azak partners with major ride-hailing apps like SafeBoda in Uganda, gaining access to customer databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:00">[30:52:00]</a>. This provides alternative data (e.g., number of trips, customer ratings) for quick credit risk assessment, bypassing traditional requirements like bank statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:19:00">[31:19:00]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: Azak boasts a three-day loan turnaround time, significantly faster than traditional lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:56:00">[31:56:00]</a>.
*   **Automated Products**: They offer automated secondary loan products for fuel and smartphones, difficult for brick-and-mortar lenders to compete with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:04:00">[32:04:00]</a>. This automation solves customer problems quickly and cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:16:00">[32:16:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Risk**: By focusing on productive business loans, Azak drastically reduces risk compared to unsecured consumer loans offered by some digital lenders (e.g., in Kenya, where rates can reach 300% APR due to high default rates from unproductive use like gambling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:19:00">[34:19:00]</a>. This "virtuous circle" allows for cheaper credit for borrowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36:00">[34:36:00]</a>.

## Addressing Investment Risks in Africa
While investors often express skepticism due to weaker rule of law and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:54:00">[35:54:00]</a>, Azak demonstrates how these risks can be mitigated.

*   **Legal System Challenges**: Uganda's court system is slow, with lawsuits potentially pending for years, and processes can be compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05:00">[36:05:00]</a>. Credit reference bureaus are also not as strong as in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:00">[37:00:00]</a>.
*   **Innovative Risk Mitigation**: Azak uses technology to secure loans:
    *   **GPS Trackers**: A GPS tracker in the motorcycle can cut off fuel to the engine if payments stop, rendering the bike unusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:35:00">[37:35:00]</a>. For customers living day-to-day, being without their motorcycle (their primary source of income) even for one day means they cannot eat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:47:00">[37:47:00]</a>.
    *   **Contextual Acceptance**: While such a feature might not be allowed in the US due to privacy laws, Ugandans accept it as a means to access credit without traditional requirements like bank statements or land titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:05:00">[38:05:00]</a>.
*   **Outperforming US Lenders**: Despite weaker legal infrastructure, Azak's default rate on motorcycle loans in [[Challenges and opportunities in African economies | Africa]] is 3%, which is lower than the 5.8% default rate on auto loans in the US, demonstrating the effectiveness of their tech innovations in securing assets and parsing risk non-traditionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:38:00">[38:38:00]</a>.

## Local Integration and Commitment
Kevin strongly believes in building businesses in [[Challenges and opportunities in African economies | Africa]] by living there and integrating with local society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:45:00">[39:45:00]</a>. Unlike some competitors whose CEOs don't reside in [[Challenges and opportunities in African economies | Africa]], he emphasizes the need to experience local problems firsthand to solve them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:00">[39:50:00]</a>. Kevin has committed to living in [[Challenges and opportunities in African economies | Africa]] long-term and is learning three Ugandan languages, underscoring the importance of buy-in from local people for true success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:17:00">[40:17:00]</a>. This dedication highlights Azak's commitment to building a business that not only generates profit but genuinely helps people's lives and fosters development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:57:00">[40:57:00]</a>.

"Building Public" is presented as a deep, behind-the-scenes look at the realities of [[building_a_successful_tech_startup | building a company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>. It aims to document the raw and real details, including the highs and lows, of the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:49">[01:29:49]</a>. This approach involves sharing insights on fundraising, typical weekly activities, challenges, and how the process impacts personal lives and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:58">[01:42:58]</a>.

## Reasons for Building Public

The primary motivation for engaging in building public is to finally share what the company is doing with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. It's about being transparent with the journey of [[building_a_successful_tech_startup | building the company]] of their dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:99">[01:40:99]</a>.

## Benefits and Outcomes

### Initial Launch Success
The company's launch garnered significant attention, with "millions of people" seeing their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. They received over a million impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. Max noted that their LinkedIn post likely had a million impressions and their Twitter post hundreds of thousands of views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:99">[03:44:99]</a>. While some might consider these vanity metrics, for a consumer company, they are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:30">[03:51:30]</a>.

The launch exceeded expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:10">[04:00:10]</a>, leading to:
*   A hiring pipeline of hundreds of candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:65">[04:07:65]</a>.
*   Tens of thousands of waitlist sign-ups, which are seen as "upstream of revenue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:97">[04:10:97]</a>.

Several factors contributed to the viral launch:
*   **Building in stealth:** Laying groundwork for a while before the public reveal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:98">[04:22:98]</a>.
*   **Existing following:** Leveraging a pre-existing audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:02">[04:28:02]</a>.
*   **Emotionally salient narrative:** The story resonated with people who had tough experiences with the healthcare system, offering "a glimmer of hope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:40">[04:33:40]</a>.
*   **Visually stunning website:** The product's presentation was compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:16">[04:52:16]</a>.
*   **Conspicuous domain name:** A memorable and noticeable online presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:90">[04:57:90]</a>.

### Leveraging Existing Relationships
Years of conversations with healthcare professionals, founders, and operators provided a strong network of support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:23">[05:06:23]</a>. The public launch provided a way for these people to demonstrate their support and impression of the founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:14">[05:14:14]</a>. When founders commit to a "10-15 year mission," people are drawn to support them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a>. This public commitment allows people to see the humble and curious nature of the founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:19">[05:54:19]</a>.

### Positive Pressure and Accountability
Having "lots of eyeballs" creates good pressure, making success a necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:02">[02:37:02]</a>. This public exposure means "we don't have a choice, we have to make this succeed now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:01">[02:42:01]</a>.

### Attracting Investors
The company successfully raised capital from "massive investors" and angels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:21">[10:01:21]</a>. This backing was attributed to:
*   The co-founders' experience in [[building_a_billion_dollar_company | building large companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:94">[10:22:94]</a>.
*   An exciting vision for the future, particularly in longevity and health tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:08">[10:28:08]</a>. High-net-worth individuals, having experienced advanced medicine, understand the potential impact of making it accessible to many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:11">[10:38:11]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

### Dealing with Public Perception
*   **Haters and Disagreement:** Putting things out into the world means being on the receiving end of criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:42">[06:11:42]</a>.
*   **Founder Image vs. Brand Image:** There can be pressure for healthcare founders to embody peak health, creating irony when facing challenges like sleepless nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:38:70">[18:38:70]</a>. An intern even questioned if the founders' physical appearance aligned with the health brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:32">[19:40:32]</a>.
*   **Trade-offs:** Founders often make trade-offs, such as reduced sleep or increased stress, which are inherent to the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:39">[20:10:39]</a>. The goal is to stay within a "golden lock zone" where stress and lack of sleep don't negatively impact performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:50">[20:22:50]</a>.

### Internal Operations and Focus
*   **Context Switching:** Constant context switching, especially in media-heavy environments, can be detrimental to focus and productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:15">[21:11:15]</a>.
*   **Procrastination:** A common form of procrastination is doing less important work, which can feel productive but doesn't move the needle on critical priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39:19">[22:39:19]</a>.
*   **Scaling Communication:** As the team grows, efficiently scaling communication becomes a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:77">[24:28:77]</a>. While documentation is important, getting everyone to read and retain everything is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:40">[25:21:40]</a>.
*   **Founder Anxiety:** Anxiety can drive founders into "operator mode," focusing on execution rather than stepping back to ensure the company is heading in the right direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:42:25">[35:42:25]</a>.
*   **Balancing Ambiguity:** It's crucial not to share ambiguity about the roadmap and vision with the team, as it can hinder work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:17:15">[29:17:15]</a>. However, sharing uncertainty around execution can build trust and momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:86">[29:43:86]</a>.

## Strategies for Success in Public Company Building

### Core Mission and Long-Term Vision
*   **The 30-Year Company:** The company aims to move away from the model of building a "widget that can exit after 5 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:19">[06:54:19]</a>. Instead, they focus on solving real problems and [[building_a_billion_dollar_company | building a company]] that team members want to work on for 30+ years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:21">[07:01:21]</a>.
*   **Going All In:** The founders emphasize making an "all in" decision rather than treating the company as a stepping stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:44">[08:23:44]</a>.

### Operational Efficiency
*   **Minimizing Context Switching:** To combat context switching, the organization implemented "Deep Work Wednesdays" and dedicated meeting-free blocks on Monday and Friday afternoons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:03">[21:52:03]</a>.
*   **Ruthless Prioritization:** Founders must be ruthless with prioritization, focusing on the few things that truly drive company success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:47:66">[33:47:66]</a>. For a [[building_a_tech_media_company | tech media company]], this means focusing on product differentiation, securing good guests, and advertising sales/revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:57:48">[33:57:48]</a>.
*   **Strategic Planning:** Spending 10-15 minutes to an hour planning at the start of the day is identified as the "highest leverage thing" a founder can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36:26">[34:36:26]</a>.
*   **Sufficient Clarity for the Team:** The team should be able to state the number one priority for the business if woken up in the middle of the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24:99">[26:24:99]</a>. This clarity allows people to move faster and understand the "why" behind their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:39:15">[26:39:15]</a>.
*   **Scalable Communication:** Utilizing strategy documents and Loom recordings can help scale communication as the organization grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:31:69">[24:31:69]</a>. However, it's also important to minimize the number of things being communicated to avoid overload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:17">[25:51:17]</a>.

### Leadership and [[building_company_culture_and_founder_mindset | Founder Mindset]]
*   **Team Importance:** Recognizing that companies are "good people in a sitting in a room together" underscores the paramount importance of team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:32:89">[32:32:89]</a>. Continuously upgrading processes for hiring, onboarding, and maximizing team potential provides ultimate leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:71">[32:51:71]</a>.
*   **Shielding the Team:** Founders should shoulder pressure and uncertainty (e.g., revenue, sales) rather than exposing it to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:35:10">[27:35:10]</a>. This allows employees to focus on their core tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:48:02">[27:48:02]</a>.
*   **Embracing Uncertainty:** Instead of controlling uncertainty with operator mode, founders should "embrace that uncertainty with a hug" to foster creative new directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:34:02">[36:36:40]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Nature of Founders:** Stress can be viewed as a "muscle" that, when exercised, helps founders adapt and grow to lead larger organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:36:27">[28:36:27]</a>.
*   **From Doing to Orchestrating:** As the company progresses, a founder's role shifts from doing the work (copywriting, design, customer calls) to orchestrating the work, which involves steering the ship in the right direction and motivating the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:04:80">[39:04:80]</a>.

### Personal Well-being
*   **Choosing Happiness:** Max made a conscious decision to be happier, leading to a 20% increase in happiness, independent of external circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:01">[13:42:01]</a>. This involved accepting the world as it is rather than trying to force it into place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:09">[14:17:09]</a>.
*   **Happiness and Performance:** Happiness is not a tradeoff for performance, nor does suffering guarantee it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:01">[16:25:01]</a>. Instead, happiness can *help* performance, fostering a "feeling of flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:55">[16:43:55]</a>.
*   **Flow State:** Achieving a flow state, even amidst difficulty, leads to greater happiness and productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:00]</a>. This is analogous to enduring physical pain in a marathon while still feeling present and fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:07">[17:05:07]</a>.
*   **Emotional Awareness:** Labeling emotions more accurately and engaging in creative, "soulful" activities (e.g., art, photography, old films, pen and paper) can nourish the founder and improve operational effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:41:40">[45:41:40]</a>.
*   **Intentional "Doing Nothing":** Intentionally choosing moments to "do nothing" (e.g., instead of checking a phone) allows the mind to think, reset, and process information, fostering creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:31:12">[47:31:12]</a>.

### Learning and Inspiration
*   **Experience-Driven Learning:** The rate of learning is largely derivative of difficult experiences in work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:53:07">[40:53:07]</a>.
*   **Overcoming Fear:** Often, knowing the answer but being scared to act on it is a barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:03:00">[41:03:00]</a>. Fear stems from uncertainty, which can be reduced by taking more action (gaining experience) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:39:15">[42:39:15]</a>.
*   **Diverse Perspectives:** Surrounding oneself with people outside of one's core industry (e.g., tech) and those with different emotional or creative lenses provides the best insights and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:57:37">[48:57:37]</a>.
*   **Creative Synthesis:** Creativity is often about observing great existing ideas, recognizing their quality, and combining them in novel ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:50:57">[50:50:57]</a>.

## Future Focus
For a [[building_a_tech_media_company | tech media company]], consistent content creation is highlighted as highly leveraged for hiring, customer acquisition, telling the narrative, and [[building_company_culture_and_founder_mindset | building the brand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:23:44">[51:23:44]</a>. The most resonant brands of the future are expected to be the people who work at those companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:34:53">[51:34:53]</a>. It's easy to get caught in the "rat race of day-to-day company work" and neglect content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:47:19">[51:47:19]</a>.

There is a continued focus on execution of content strategy, especially ensuring the content is "n of one" (unique) and an authentic extension of the founders, rather than trying to be something they are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:52:13">[52:52:13]</a>. Authentically expressing beliefs leads to more emotionally resonant outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:01:21">[53:01:21]</a>.

Paul Bassat is a prominent figure in Australia's startup and venture capital industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Initially known as the co-founder of Seek, a multi-billion dollar online employment marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, he later transitioned to become an influential investor, co-founding Square Peg Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Early Life and Career as a Founder

Paul Bassat grew up in Melbourne, Australia, with parents who were migrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. He describes his upbringing as "really lucky," growing up in a "great family in an amazing country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. His mother was a Holocaust survivor, an event that was "the defining event obviously of her life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

He began his career as a lawyer, studying law and commerce, and working in the field for six years, which he genuinely enjoyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This conventional path shifted when he, along with his brother Andrew and Matt Rockman, started Seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. From that point, his career has been focused on technology, startups, and disruptive innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

### Founding and Scaling Seek

Seek was founded in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. At the time, no one had successfully solved the problem of online employment advertising in Australia, though it was clear to Bassat and his co-founders that this shift from print to online would happen, similar to real estate and automotive classifieds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.

The primary challenge for Seek was the "cold start problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>, which meant starting with no job seekers and no job ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. Their strategy involved:
*   **Pricing as a Lever**: They used aggressive pricing to attract job ads, even starting with very low or no fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. For example, their first major advertiser, Chandler Macleod, paid nothing or a nominal fee of $500 a month, and they manually typed in 300 faxed ads to go live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>.
*   **Supplementary Medium**: Initially, Seek positioned itself as a supplementary platform to traditional newspaper advertising, rather than a replacement. This allowed companies to experiment without risking their main recruitment channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>. Over time, Seek became more crucial, leading clients to reduce their print spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>.

Paul Bassat notes that while many competitors and others were skeptical of the internet as an employment medium (e.g., "you can't read the internet on the toilet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>), it was "very, very obvious" to the Seek founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>. Seek successfully IPO'd and grew into an $8 billion company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Transition to Investing: Square Peg Capital

After his involvement with Seek, Paul Bassat co-founded Square Peg Capital in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. The firm now manages over $3 billion in assets and has invested in notable companies such as Stripe, Airwallex, and Canva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

Bassat describes the venture capital industry as having transformed dramatically over the last 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>, moving from a "pretty cozy world" centered in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a> to a global "democratization of venture capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>. He cites the growth of startup ecosystems in places like Europe, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>.

### Square Peg's Investment Philosophy

Square Peg operates with a "high conviction" investment approach, making fewer, but more significant, investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39:00">[22:39:00]</a>. A significant portion of their investments are in "pre-revenue businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:18:00">[22:18:00]</a>, including companies like Airwallex, Zeller, Canva, and OwnHome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>.

A key differentiator for Square Peg is its international presence, with offices in Tel Aviv (Israel) and Singapore (Southeast Asia), in addition to Australia and New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. This multi-geographic strategy allows them to:
*   **Benchmark Globally**: They benchmark Australian founders against the best in all their geographies, ensuring investments in "remarkable founders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:00">[27:08:00]</a>.
*   **Thematic Investing**: Operating across multiple regions allows them to be more thematic in their investments (e.g., consumer internet, SaaS, fintech, education, future of work, digital health), deepening their knowledge and networks in specific areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:00">[27:26:00]</a>. This thematic focus provides "significant knowledge and networks and expertise" that compounds over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:04:00">[28:04:00]</a>, benefiting both Square Peg and their founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>.
*   **Learning from Mature Ecosystems**: Lessons from mature ecosystems like Israel, which has been successful for 30-40 years, are invaluable for contributing to the Australian ecosystem, which is on a similar, albeit earlier, journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:13:00">[29:13:00]</a>.

### Views on the Current Market and Future of Tech

Paul Bassat believes that venture capital is fundamentally an "outlier business" driven by the "power law," where a single investment in a fund can return the entire fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. He emphasizes that while different VC firms (like Tiger Global or Benchmark) have varying models, all successful VCs acknowledge this principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>.

On current market conditions, Bassat offers insights from Seek's experience during the dot-com crash:
*   **Downturns as Opportunities**: He advises founders not to fear a downturn if they are well-capitalized and have a strong business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>. The period between 2000-2003, when Seek's valuation remained flat despite significant internal value creation, was "the single most important value creation period" for the company, laying foundations for its future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:37:00">[35:37:00]</a>.
*   **Sustainable Growth**: While growth is essential for young startups (you "cannot shrink your way to greatness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:37:00">[36:37:00]</a>), it must be sustainable with sound unit economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:53:00">[37:53:00]</a>. He cautions against "growth at any cost," where companies acquire customers at a loss, noting this was a problem during the dot-com era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:54:00">[36:54:00]</a>. He cites Atlassian as an example of a company that achieved remarkable success through consistent, compounded growth over two decades without relying on venture capital for its first 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:58:00">[37:58:00]</a>.

Regarding future opportunities, Bassat finds crypto "incredibly fascinating" but complex, believing that many solutions are "looking for a problem" currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>, similar to the early internet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>. He believes the future will involve continued innovation around ownership, incentives, and decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Drivers

Paul Bassat is driven by a sense of purpose, a desire to empower others, and a deep curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. He loves to learn and share his knowledge, hoping others can benefit as he has from learning from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. For him, career success is about "building things that are bigger than me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

He emphasizes the role of serendipity and luck in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>, noting he has been "incredibly lucky" to be born in Melbourne, have amazing parents, and receive a good education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. His small role in this luck has been being "prepared to take those opportunities" and not being afraid of "looking stupid" or the implications of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. He defines failure not as trying and not succeeding, but as "not being prepared to show up and not having a crack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.

His advice for young people is to find something you love, do it to the best of your ability, and "be authentic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:55:00">[39:55:00]</a>. He genuinely loves being an investor, backing founders, and feels "very lucky to admit some remarkable founders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:36:00">[40:36:00]</a>. His experiences, from founding Seek to his current role at Square Peg, demonstrate a consistent passion for building and supporting impactful ventures.

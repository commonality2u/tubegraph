## Event Overview

The article is based on a panel discussion that took place at a Regen Ventures event in SoHo, New York. The event brought together prominent figures in the climate space, including Seth Godin and [[Alex Honnolds transition from climbing to climate change | Alex Honnold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. The discussion centered on climate change and [[the_importance_of_storytelling_in_modern_media | The Art of Storytelling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, which was highlighted as one of the most important topics of our time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The Challenge of Climate Action

Seth Godin, a prolific author and teacher, emphasizes that anyone who examines the geo-planet and cultural systems cannot deny what is happening with climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Despite this, he observes that minor world events often overshadow the long-term work required for climate action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

A core challenge identified is the "storytelling problem" in climate tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The current narrative often fails to engage the masses and build the necessary tribes and movements to drive adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Godin notes that adoption is always unevenly distributed, citing the slow adoption of the steam engine as a historical parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

The fundamental issue in climate technology is the lack of a price on carbon, making much of the work "premature" as there is no inherent incentive to buy the solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This creates a "catch-22": products need to be built before there's an incentive to buy them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## The Role of Storytelling

To address the challenges in climate action, Seth Godin provides several insights on effective communication and change:

*   **Systemic Solutions**: Climate change is a systems problem that requires a system solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. Shaming individuals for minor actions (e.g., using a plastic water bottle) will not fix the larger system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.
*   **Shunning Non-believers**: When implementing system change, it is crucial to avoid engaging with non-believers who seek attention through opposition. Winning debates with them does not change the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.
*   **Scaffolding**: Offer people "scaffolding" to engage with the story in small, incremental steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. This helps them overcome roadblocks and progress in their understanding and involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.
*   **Tension vs. Fear**: Instead of creating fear, which can lead to feelings of being trapped and denial, focus on creating tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>. Tension, like a rubber band pulled back, implies forward momentum and the possibility of missing an opportunity if one doesn't act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. The goal is to motivate people positively, understanding that 1% adoption today can lead to 2% tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

## Alex Honnold's Perspective and the Honnold Foundation

[[Alex Honnolds transition from climbing to climate change | Alex Honnold]], famed for free solo climbing, co-hosts the *Planet Visionaries* podcast and founded the Honnold Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. He highlights that while his climbing feats might seem impossible, they are physically possible and primarily scary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This perspective extends to climate issues: the [[the_role_of_innovation_in_climate_solutions | technology]] to transition to a better world largely exists; the challenge lies in the "chutzpah" to deploy solutions quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

Honnold's approach to seemingly impossible tasks is to "buckle down and get to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, transforming something daunting into something manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. He emphasizes the difference between being prepared and being ready, stating that for physical risks, a deep fear indicates not being ready, but excitement suggests possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

> "Don't do something you're not prepared for, but you got to do it before you're ready." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a> â€” Seth Godin

Alex Honnold has observed [[personal_experiences_of_climate_change_impacts | significant changes in wild places]] he frequents for climbing, including glacial retreat and the disappearance of ice climbs that are unlikely to reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. These year-over-year changes, even altering access to mountains, are sobering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

Honnold started the Honnold Foundation over a decade ago, initially to support environmental projects that also improved human communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. He believes that people won't care about the environment unless their basic needs are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. The foundation specifically focuses on solar projects, particularly in areas lacking energy access, as solar offers a "win-win" for people and the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. Energy access is seen as a crucial step for economic development and lifestyle improvements, especially in tropical regions where people might live in darkness for half the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Nature's Resilience
> Through his work on the *Planet Visionaries* podcast, [[Alex Honnolds transition from climbing to climate change | Alex Honnold]] has been inspired by the resilience of [[naturebased_solutions_for_climate_change | nature]]. He notes that if a natural ecosystem is given even the slightest chance, it will regrow, come back, and blossom. This positive outlook counters the prevalent environmental "Doom and Gloom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.

## Seth Godin on System Change and Carbon Pricing

Seth Godin highlights that the "ecosystem of [[combating_climate_change_through_investment | investment]]" mirrors the systemic change needed in climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. He advocates for a carbon dividend plus border adjustment system as a solution to create a systemic market for carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

This theory proposes that every person in a country (e.g., the United States) receives an annual check, funded entirely by charging an accurate price for carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>. For example, a private jet flight to London might cost $480,000, with $380,000 distributed to the public for the environmental damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. Godin argues that markets are highly responsive to costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>. As people become accustomed to receiving these checks, they will change their behavior, and prices will adjust accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.

This system is not a tax; it accurately represents the true cost of carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>. As [[the_role_of_innovation_in_climate_solutions | alternatives]] become more reasonable, entrepreneurs and businesses will gain a [[combating_climate_change_through_investment | financial incentive]] to support this regime, leading them to lobby for its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. The "border adjustment" component extends this theory globally, ensuring that goods imported from other countries also engage with this carbon pricing method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. Godin believes that the market, which contributed to the problem, can also solve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.

Discussions at the Regen Ventures event highlighted the critical role of [[strategic_decisionmaking_in_software_markets | systems change]] and market incentives in addressing climate challenges. Experts emphasized that while many technologies exist, their widespread adoption and the necessary societal shift depend on re-aligning economic drivers [00:08:27].

## The Storytelling Challenge and Adoption

A significant hurdle for [[challenges_in_the_adoption_of_climate_technology | climate technology]] is its "storytelling problem," hindering the ability to build mass movements [00:05:24]. Adoption is inherently unevenly distributed, as evidenced by historical innovations like the steam engine, which took a long time to move beyond a "toy" [00:05:38].

Seth Godin points out a fundamental "Catch-22" in [[the_role_of_innovation_in_climate_solutions | innovation]] for climate solutions:
> "Without a price on carbon almost all the work that's being done by people in this room is premature because you're making something that there isn't incentive to buy. And but we're not going to have an incentive to buy it until you build it. So there's a Catch-22 going on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

The long-term vision is to create conditions where wealthy industrialists can make more money through green practices, thereby introducing a price on carbon [00:06:19].

## Shifting from Impossible to Manageable

Alex Honnold noted that addressing climate change isn't "impossible," but rather seems "improbable" or "scary" [00:08:01]. Similar to climbing, where physical ability exists even without a rope, the technologies for a better world largely exist [00:08:10]. The primary lacking element is the "chutzpah to deploy things and to move quickly enough" [00:08:35]. This requires consistent effort and a willingness to "just grind for a while" until the seemingly difficult becomes manageable [00:09:24].

Seth Godin distinguishes between being "prepared" and "ready":
> "Don't do something you're not prepared for, but you got to do it before you're ready" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

True [[the_role_of_innovation_in_climate_solutions | innovation]] lives in the "liminal space" between "three and go," where one decides to become the kind of person who takes action [00:13:17]. Alex Honnold emphasizes the importance of executing a plan, even if it means ignoring personal feelings and going on "autopilot" to stick to the set path [00:14:09].

## The Stepwise Process and Ecosystem Building

Building impactful companies, like starting a non-profit, involves a "stepwise process" [00:17:34]. Seth Godin advises laying bricks to gain "altitude to see what could happen next" [00:18:14]. His practical rule for innovators is simple: "Don't run out of time and don't run out of money because if you run out of time and you run out of money you don't get to play anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

### Honnold Foundation's Approach to Solar Projects
Alex Honnold initiated the Honnold Foundation over a decade ago to support solar projects globally [00:19:28]. His motivation stemmed from a sense of fairness and a desire to contribute positively, initially funding solar as a "win-win for both people and the environment" [00:19:47]. He observed that environmental concerns often take a backseat unless basic human needs, like energy access, are met [00:22:50]. With a billion people worldwide lacking access to power, solar projects offer a starting point for economic development and lifestyle improvements [00:22:58]. The foundation has since explicitly made solar access its mission [00:23:49].

## Systems Change through Interconnected Efforts

Godin stresses that climate change is a [[strategic_decisionmaking_in_software_markets | systems problem]] requiring a [[strategic_decisionmaking_in_software_markets | systems solution]] [00:31:54]. Individual actions, like shaming plastic water bottle users, won't fix systemic issues [00:32:02]. He identifies key elements for [[strategic_decisionmaking_in_software_markets | systems change]]:
*   **Shun non-believers**: Avoid engaging with those seeking attention through opposition, as winning debates won't change the system [00:32:22].
*   **Scaffolding**: Offer incremental support to help people engage with the story, moving them from small steps to greater involvement [00:32:42].
*   **Strategy over tactics**: Develop a philosophy of becoming, articulating how actions will lead to systemic shifts, rather than relying on miracles [00:33:15].

## Market-Based Solutions: Carbon Dividend and Border Adjustment

One proposed solution for market incentives is a "carbon dividend plus border adjustment" [00:40:34]. This model involves:
1.  **Annual checks**: Every person in the United States receives an annual check.
2.  **Carbon pricing**: 100% of the money for these checks comes from accurately pricing carbon emissions [00:40:58]. The government acts as a pass-through, not touching the money.
3.  **Behavioral change**: As people become accustomed to these checks, they start modifying their behavior, realizing how their actions influence the dividend [00:41:35].
4.  **Market adjustment**: Over time, market prices adjust, making sustainable choices more attractive and increasing dividends [00:41:48].
5.  **Lobbying shift**: As alternatives become reasonable, businesses will find financial incentives to lobby for this regime [00:42:26].
6.  **Border adjustment**: This exports the theory, ensuring goods manufactured in countries without carbon pricing are still subject to it when imported [00:42:36].

This approach leverages markets, which are "very very good at listening to costs" [00:41:22], to correct the historical undervaluation of carbon that made burning oil so attractive [00:42:19]. The market, which caused the problem, can also solve it [00:43:08].

## Nature's Resilience

Despite the challenges, Alex Honnold's experiences through his "Planet Visionaries" podcast and conservation work highlight the surprising resilience of nature. He notes that if a natural ecosystem is given "even the slightest chance, it will regrow, it will come back, it will blossom" [00:28:57]. Marine protected areas are a prime example: preventing human destruction allows nature to thrive [00:29:00]. This perspective offers a reminder that the world is "waiting to blossom; it just needs the chance" [00:29:28].

This reinforces the idea that [[combating_climate_change_through_investment | investment]] in green [[the_role_of_innovation_in_climate_solutions | innovation]] and [[naturebased_solutions_for_climate_change | nature-based solutions]] allows for increased agricultural yields and other efficiencies, enabling more land to return to its natural state [00:30:05]. The goal is to produce goods and services in ways that actively heal nature, focusing on planetary health, biodiversity, water, and human well-being, without sacrificing quality of life [00:30:48].

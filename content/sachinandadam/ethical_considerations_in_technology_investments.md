Sam Wong, a partner at Blackbird Ventures, Australia's largest venture firm, offers unique insights into [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | the tech ecosystem]] and [[investing_in_startups_and_earlystage_companies | investing in startups and early-stage companies]]. She emphasizes the critical ethical role venture capitalists (VCs) play in shaping the future through their [[investment_in_technology_and_emerging_markets | investments in technology and emerging markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## The Ethical Imperative in Investment
Wong believes that VCs must deeply consider the ethical implications of the technologies they fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. She highlights the potential for technology to create vast inequality and questions the societal impact of trends like the metaverse, quantum computing, and general AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

### ESG Concerns in Decision-Making
At Blackbird Ventures, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns are explicitly integrated into the [[strategic_decisionmaking_in_software_markets | investment decision-making process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. After a founder's pitch, partners complete a form to evaluate aspects like team, market, distribution, and crucially, any ESG concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. This systematic approach ensures early conversations with founders about how their vision might accelerate both positive and negative societal impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. Wong notes that in 99% of cases, these early discussions unlock more positive potential than negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The integration of ESG into the investment process forces VCs and founders to confront potential ethical challenges and maximize positive [[social_impact_and_innovation_in_emerging_technologies | social impact and innovation in emerging technologies]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>

## Investing in Founders' "Life's Work"
A key aspect of ethical investment, for Wong, is backing founders whose companies are their "life's work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. These founders have already thought deeply about ethical considerations and integrate them into their company's core building principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:12]</a>.

### Case Study: Harrison.ai
An example is Harrison.ai, a healthcare AI company. From the earliest conversations, their founders demonstrated a foundational understanding of privacy and ethics, integrating these as critical pillars alongside technical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. This contrasts with other AI companies that might focus solely on technical prowess without considering how their technology integrates into real-world clinical workflows or ethical implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

## Broader Societal Implications
The rapid development of powerful technologies necessitates careful consideration of their use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. The motivations of founders and the incentives driving technology's application are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. Lessons from the past, such as the negative implications of social media on mental health and privacy, underscore the need for foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

Wong emphasizes the ongoing role of humanities and arts in fostering critical thinking and ethical conversations around technological development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.

## Investing with Humility and Observation
Wong's personal approach to [[investing_in_startups_and_earlystage_companies | investing in startups and early-stage companies]] has evolved to be more observant and less prescriptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:24:00">[28:24:00]</a>. She actively tries to quiet her own voice and plant fewer ideas, ensuring that the company's vision remains truly the founder's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>. This humility recognizes that founders inherently know their companies, businesses, and customers far better than any investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. The VC's role is to provide data and belief to help founders make informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

### The Dangers of Bias and "Pattern Recognition"
While "pattern recognition" can be useful, Wong distinguishes it from problematic bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>. The challenge for VCs is maintaining a curious mind and quietening skepticism when faced with similar ideas, to avoid missing a "once in a generation company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>. Awareness of these biases is the first step towards mitigating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. She advises looking for a "weirdness" that signals something truly different and differentiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] A key piece of advice for VCs and aspiring entrepreneurs alike is to "listen twice, speak once" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:00]</a>. This fosters better understanding and allows founders to lead with their authentic vision.

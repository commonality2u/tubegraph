Peter Corbett, a partner at Deloitte Monitor and head of Monitor Deloitte in Sydney, specializes in strategy consulting, a field he considers crucial for business success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. His background as a former entrepreneur, having started several businesses, informs his practical approach to strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

## Defining Business Strategy

Strategy, while sometimes seen as a buzzword alongside "innovation" and "transformation," is critically important when executed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. At Monitor Deloitte, strategy is defined as "an act of making choices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This definition is based on a framework called the "cascade of choices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

Key aspects of strategy:
*   **Choice**: Strategy specifies what an organization *will* do and, importantly, what it *won't* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Narrative**: Tied-together choices create a coherent narrative or direction for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Position**: It involves taking a clear position on a particular choice, deciding whether to play in an area or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Winning**: Ultimately, strategy is about winning; choices should lead to a compelling position that can outperform competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## The Increased Importance of Strategy

[[impact_of_covid19_on_business_strategy | The impact of COVID-19 on business strategy]] has highlighted the necessity of re-evaluating core assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Many pre-pandemic assumptions no longer hold true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Examples illustrating this shift:
*   **Toilet Paper Manufacturers**: Faced a massive spike in demand, prompting reconsideration of long-term customer service and sales strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Travel Companies and Gyms**: Experienced a sharp drop in physical demand, forcing them to redefine their organizational identity. Gyms moved to online classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, and travel companies like Qantas sold assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

These examples demonstrate why strategy is more important than ever: companies must rationalize their choices based on a changed set of assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## The Strategy Cascade Framework

The "cascade of choices" framework comprises five integrated choices that define a coherent strategy:

1.  **What is Your Ambition/Aspiration?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>
    *   This defines what winning looks like for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
    *   Increasingly, aspirations are shifting from being purely financial (profit-driven) to [[balancing_corporate_roles_and_personal_values | purpose-driven]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

2.  **Where to Play?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>
    *   Identifies which customers, channels, markets, or products will be utilized to achieve the aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

3.  **How to Win?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>
    *   Determines the unique value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
    *   Common strategies include being the lowest cost provider or being highly differentiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

4.  **What Capabilities are Needed?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>
    *   Focuses on the strengths, activities, and processes necessary to make the "how to win" strategy achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

5.  **What Management Systems are Required?** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>
    *   Defines how progress is measured and how the strategy is brought to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

> "If you go down the cascade, you can tell a coherent story around why you're doing things. If you go up, you can tell coherent stories, how does it map to my ambition?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>

This framework can also be applied to an individual's life for personal strategic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

### Recommended Reading
*   **"Play to Win"**: Authored by Roger Martin (former MD of Monitor) and A.G. Lafley (former CEO of Procter & Gamble). It details the application of this framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

## Democratizing Strategy and Execution

Strategy should not be confined to an "ivory tower" or solely done by senior executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. A key aim for consultants is to democratize strategy, making it a topic for everyone to discuss and challenge, fostering better decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

> "Strategy without execution is not strategy at all." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>

The ability to link strategy with execution relies heavily on the democratization of strategic discussions throughout an organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

## Qualities of an Effective Strategist

Being an effective strategist involves a combination of structured thinking, openness, and analytical rigor:

*   **Structured Problem Solving**: The ability to break down complex, abstract problems into smaller, solvable component parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.
    *   **Recommended Reading**: "The Pyramid Principle" by Barbara Minto offers guidance on turning complex problems into bite-sized chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.
*   **[[the_role_of_design_and_innovation_in_business_success | Design Thinking]]**: Being comfortable with exploring divergent options before converging on the most possible ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. This involves using framing like "what would need to be true?" to assess feasibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.
*   **Analytical Acumen**: Understanding the financial impact (P&L, bottom line) of strategic choices on the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.
*   **Curiosity**: The drive to ask "why" repeatedly and anticipate future consequences (e.g., three steps ahead) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.
*   **Openness**: Being receptive to new styles of thinking and concepts, particularly when planning for long-term (5-10 year) strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.
*   **Listening and Learning**: Acknowledging when one doesn't have an immediate answer and engaging with clients to understand their situation, then applying knowledge and frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.

## Future Thinking and Scenario Planning

Building futuristic thinking into strategy is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. This involves:
*   Painting a picture of potential futures rather than relying solely on analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.
*   Identifying "critical uncertainties" and using them to create different scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.
*   Developing resilient strategies that include "must-do" options adaptable across various scenarios, and "optional" ones to be pursued if a specific scenario plays out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

The Telco, Media, and Tech (TMT) industry exemplifies an industry where many mega-trends (AI, 5G, cloud) converge, leading to a rapid rate of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. For telcos, this means rethinking their ability to monetize critical infrastructure and adapting to the increasing rate of digital interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. This necessitates [[balancing_risk_and_innovation_in_business_strategy | strategic flexibility]] to either seize opportunities (e.g., virtual health offerings) or bunker down and cut costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.

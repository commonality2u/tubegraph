After Work Ventures, led by Jessie Wu, is described as one of the most well-known entities in the Australian startup ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Jessie Wu is considered a leading up-and-coming VC in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> and is often seen as a role model for young people in the venture capital ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Evolution of After Work Ventures

After Work Ventures officially launched around March 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. Its initial differentiation was being a community-powered fund, comprising approximately 25 individuals who would meet on Sunday evenings to discuss startup opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. Upon investment, founders received a "Rolodex" of these 25 people, offering expertise in areas like growth marketing or financial modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. This meant a standard angel check size (25-50K) provided access to a whole group indirectly invested in the founder's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

Since then, After Work has raised a professional-sized fund of just over $20 million, allowing three individuals—Jessie Wu, Alex, and Adrian—to work full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.

## Core Beliefs and Investment Strategy

After two years, After Work has refined two key beliefs that differentiate them from other funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>:

### 1. High Conviction Requires a Time Series
After Work believes that deep conviction, necessary for deploying a significant portion of their fund into a company (e.g., 10%), requires a 360-degree view of how someone engages and interacts over an extended period, ideally a 12-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>. This level of conviction cannot be achieved through a typical one-week due diligence process, especially if it's virtual or limited to business meetings, as individuals can sustain a facade for a short time but not for a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. Gathering diverse data points on a founder's engagement and problem-solving abilities builds a rich view, indicating their capacity to navigate future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

Their model reflects this:
*   **Initial Checks**: Relatively small, ranging from $100K to $400K <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. They plan to make 40 to 50 of these initial investments from their first fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
*   **Community Integration**: After an initial investment, the founder is brought into After Work's community, which now numbers 120 people, all supportive of the founder's success and offering their expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   **Data Collection**: Feedback from the community provides a rich understanding of the founder's character, problem-solving skills, resourcefulness, and diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>. This, combined with business metrics and investor updates, forms the basis for high-conviction decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.
*   **Follow-On Checks**: These are substantial, typically $1 million to $1.5 million, representing nearly 10% of the fund in a single company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. After Work secures super pro rata rights not through contractual terms, but by being first believers and demonstrating value, earning a place in founders' trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.

### 2. Valuation Discipline
After Work maintains that valuation discipline is crucial at every investment stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. Investing at $10 million versus $20 million means needing half the outcome to achieve a 100x return versus a 50x return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. While they are not overly strict on minor differences (e.g., $5 million vs. $6 million), they will pass on deals if the valuation is too high relative to the stage of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.

## Gaining Conviction at Early Stages

For initial checks, where deep conviction isn't yet possible, After Work focuses on "buying the opportunity to build a relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. They look for:
*   **Organizational Discipline**: Does the founder run a "tight ship"? This includes their mastery of business components and their ability to articulate them, especially during fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>. Fundraising is viewed as a form of sales, and they expect founders to manage it like an Enterprise sales process: prompt follow-ups, relevant detail, new information to spark FOMO, and concurrent engagement with multiple funds to create competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>. This indicates whether they can clearly prioritize and focus their energy on the most important aspects of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>.
*   **Customer Personas**: To be a [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | contrarian investor]], especially at early stages, After Work emphasizes engaging with actual customers of a solution, rather than relying solely on the industry's "systems one thinking" (intuition/emotion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>. They leverage their community of 120 people, who have diverse problem experiences and broader networks, to find subject matter experts who can validate if a problem is salient, genuinely unsolved, and worth paying to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. This direct customer validation helps them cut through industry noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:01">[00:47:01]</a>.

## Branding and Market Positioning

After Work's branding is described as unique, often slightly edgy, and modern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. As an upstart, branding is crucial for differentiation, unlike established funds with strong networks and track records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

Jessie Wu explains their branding philosophy using the concept of "resonance," derived from the idea that two things vibrating at the same frequency create noise (like piano keys) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. For After Work, this means "dialing into our frequency" and trusting that those tuned to it will hear and resonate with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. This "frequency" is found when communication flows naturally, expressing something truly authentic and personal, rather than just cobbling together what others say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. It requires trusting the audience's intelligence and discernment, avoiding "bullshitting" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

After Work also plays a role in the broader Australian ecosystem by supporting founders whose businesses are better suited for global or U.S. investors, particularly in areas Australian investors typically avoid (consumer, hardware, health tech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. Their pre-seed investments aim to make these founders "legible" to U.S. networks for natural funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

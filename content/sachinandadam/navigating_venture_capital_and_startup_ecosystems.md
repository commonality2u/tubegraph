Nikki Chevak is highlighted as a profound thinker, recognized for his insights into improving investing through the study of history and psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. He is widely regarded as the "godfather" of the [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | VC world]] in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, having founded Startmate and Blackbird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Blackbird is one of Australia's most renowned [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | venture capital]] funds, which has contributed to the creation of over $10 billion in value through its portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Startmate, an accelerator, has also launched numerous successful companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Core Philosophy and Influences

At his core, Nikki Chevak identifies as a curious person with a deep love for learning and reading across various industries and historical elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. He believes that the success of Startmate and Blackbird stems from "taking a chance on the hungry, not the proven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Contrary to mainstream belief, he observes that change is often driven by outsiders and hungry individuals with no prior business or CEO experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Psychology and Investing

Chevak emphasizes that investing is far more psychological than it is about spreadsheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. It involves understanding human behavior, especially during market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. He notes that human instinct often leads to selling when markets crash, when the rational action should be to buy more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Training oneself to act contrary to these instincts, especially by understanding the "instant reptile reaction" versus the "considered rational brain," is crucial for successful investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. In the startup realm, he finds the psychological makeup of successful founders—characterized by self-criticism, high standards, and extreme speed of progress and learning—to be particularly fascinating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### The Study of History

History provides valuable insights into "where the most ambitious people spend their time at different points in history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. For instance, 300 years ago, ambitious individuals might have founded countries or sailed the world, while a thousand years ago, they might have founded religions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Learning from their methods of success offers significant lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Key Thinkers

Nikki Chevak's thinking is heavily influenced by:
*   **Charlie Munger**: His absolute favorite person in business, known as the founder of the term "mental models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Munger's lesson is to be widely read across different fields and apply those lessons to investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Chevak highly recommends *Poor Charlie's Almanack* as a psychological book applied to investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Dan Ariely**: Though the specific book title is not mentioned, Ariely's work on behavioral flaws and shortcuts in human decision-making is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. People often seek mental shortcuts, such as relying on social proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Daniel Kahneman**: *Thinking, Fast and Slow* is cited as a great summary of his work on behavioral thinking, including the power of defaults and setting environments for good decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## Career Advice for Young Individuals

For his 23-year-old self, who had just dropped out of university (part-time) to start a company, Chevak's advice would be "just go for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. He emphasizes prioritizing where one can learn the most and the environment that produces the highest rate of learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. His first startup experience provided more learning in 12-24 months than his entire university degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

### Maximizing the Rate of Learning

*   **Avoid Traditional Grad Jobs**: Structured environments like grad jobs tend to have a very slow "drip-fed" rate of learning, and often require "unlearning" later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   **Embrace Risk**: At 23, with a low "burn rate" (no childcare, mortgage), it's the ideal time to take risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. The perceived risks of a startup failing are often overestimated; failure leads to immense learning, increased attractiveness to employers, and serendipitous networking opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   **Join a Scaling Startup**: While founding a company offers tremendous learning, Chevak believes joining a scaling startup provides an even higher rate of learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.
    *   **Ideal Stage**: Look for companies that are post-traction, ideally with 20 to 200 employees, after they've raised a Series A round (e.g., $10-$20 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Rapidly scaling companies offer overwhelming knowledge in market dynamics, customers, sales, and internal organizational navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. Young employees can experience "super promotion" and rapid career progression due to the constant creation of new roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
    *   **Contrast with Traditional Careers**: Unlike traditional fields like law, where progression is intentionally slowed, scaling startups rapidly create opportunities for junior employees to become senior leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.
    *   **Maximizing Wealth**: The expected value of joining a Series A startup is likely higher from both a learning and wealth perspective than stereotypical industries like consulting or banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   **Recommended Australian Companies (as of discussion)**:
    *   **Sydney**: Eucalyptus (over 200 employees, rapidly scaled from under 40) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>, Dovetail (around 60 employees, rapidly expanding and a talent magnet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.
    *   **Melbourne**: Linktree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>, Zeller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a> (both experiencing immense customer pull and rapid organizational growth).

## Blackbird's Vision and Strategy

Blackbird aims to be one of the best investment firms globally, an "all-in bet on Australia and New Zealand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. Its goal is to uplift Australia and New Zealand to produce more "gold medalist" businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. The belief that $100 billion companies can emerge outside Silicon Valley is gaining traction, exemplified by Atlassian, Shopify, and Spotify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. Canva, a Blackbird portfolio company, is seen as having the potential to reach the trillion-dollar valuation of Apple or Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. Blackbird's returns in its first decade have already surpassed benchmarks like Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.

### [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | Founder-First Investing]] and Power Law

To achieve significant investment returns, one must "believe in something that no one else believes in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>. A decade ago, Silicon Valley firms largely didn't believe in Australian and New Zealand startups, a sentiment that has since changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

Blackbird's unique approach configures its investing around the *company* rather than the funding *round* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. For example, Blackbird's first investment in Canva was $250,000 before revenue or product, but they have since invested $270 million more, with plans to invest hundreds of millions further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. This strategy involves investing at the very beginning (idea stage, before product/revenue) and then continuing to invest hundreds of millions as companies succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

[[Venture capital and startup evaluation | Venture capital]] is inherently a [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | power law]] business, where a few outlier companies account for the majority of returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. Examples include Atlassian for the 2000s and Canva for the 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>. Blackbird aims to concentrate capital on these outlier successes, raising both seed funds and follow-on funds for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.

### Future Outlook and [[Building and managing a venture capital fund | Fund Structure]]

Blackbird's long-term desire is to own generational companies for many decades, not just their first decade within the traditional 10-year [[Building and managing a venture capital fund | venture capital]] fund structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>. This indicates a potential move towards structures similar to a hedge fund arm, allowing continuous ownership beyond the IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. The argument is that if a strong relationship and front-row seat to a company's journey have been established, there's no reason to exit once it goes public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.

## Evolution of the [[Challenges and strategies in venture investing | VC Landscape]]

The [[Challenges and strategies in venture investing | venture capital]] landscape has changed significantly over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. A decade ago, the question was "why bother doing Australian [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | VC]]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>. Today, the question is "how are you different and unique?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. While the Australian startup ecosystem has improved with more [[Venture capital and angel investing | angel investors]] and smaller venture firms emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>, the early and mid-stage institutional venture capital landscape for Australian startups is still underserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.

### Differentiation in Modern VC

To succeed as a new [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | VC fund]] today, one cannot simply focus on a country level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. Instead, differentiation must come from focusing on:
*   An audience of talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>
*   A specific category of company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>
*   A unique perspective on underestimated people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>
*   Investing in categories that others are avoiding or deeming "unproven" or "too crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>

### The Importance of Community and Brand

Brand and media are crucial, but **community** is "the beating heart of Blackbird and [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | venture capital]] business and deal flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>. The magic of Silicon Valley lies in successful founders investing and helping the next generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. Blackbird and Startmate fostered this by building a founder community that supported their initial fund and continued through their investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

Blackbird aims to continue investing in its brand and community, which includes programs like the Startmate fellowship to help individuals enhance their careers, find jobs, and get introductions to startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>. The core of a [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | venture capital]] company's brand is "belief"—being with ambitious founders and pushing them to achieve their full vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. Despite growing fund sizes, Blackbird's "bread and butter" remains investing at the idea stage in nearly every single investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

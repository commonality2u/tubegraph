## The Superannuation Gap: A Symptom of Broader Inequality

A significant issue in [[gender_equality_in_australia_and_globally | gender equality]] is the substantial gap in superannuation at retirement, where women typically end up with 47% less super than men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. This disparity is not merely an isolated financial problem but an accumulation of career-long injustices faced by women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

The root causes of this superannuation gap include:
*   The overall [[gender_equality_in_australia_and_globally | gender pay gap]], where women are paid less than men for comparable work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>.
*   Lack of advancement to senior levels within organizations, keeping women in more junior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>.
*   Time taken out of the workforce for [[balancing_career_and_family_for_women_in_business | caring responsibilities]], such as raising children or caring for elderly relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>. Women disproportionately undertake part-time work to accommodate these responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.

## Future Super's Approach to Workplace Equity

Future Super, an ethical superannuation fund, identified the superannuation gap as a major ethical issue within its industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>. Despite being a small player, the company introduced internal policies to address this systemic problem directly within its own staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.

The three key superannuation policies implemented by Future Super, which were gender-neutral but disproportionately benefited women, were:
1.  **Higher Superannuation Rate for Lower Earners** Any staff member earning under $80,000 annually received a higher rate of superannuation contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>.
2.  **Superannuation During Parental Leave** Staff members taking parental leave were paid superannuation for the full first 12 months, which is not typical as super is usually only paid on the salary component of parental leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.
3.  **Full-Time Equivalent Super for Part-Time Carers** Part-time employees who were also carers had their superannuation paid as if they were working full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.

These policies, initially conceived in a coffee catch-up, gained attention and were eventually adopted by other super funds in their job advertisements, demonstrating a significant win for broader change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

### Addressing the Gender Pay Gap Internally

Future Super also engaged in multi-year work analyzing the [[gender_equality_in_australia_and_globally | gender pay gap]] within ASX 200 companies, revealing that a large number of companies do not even examine their own gender pay data, let alone disclose it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>.

Internally, Future Super's own journey began when a team member, on Equal Pay Day, asked about the company's [[gender_equality_in_australia_and_globally | gender pay gap]] and what was being done to fix it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. This confronting question led to a significant remuneration reset following a capital raising, reducing the internal gender pay gap from 20% to less than 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>. While there were no obvious cases of a man and woman in the same role being paid differently, the gap stemmed from "little imbalances that happen over a couple of years in a company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

## Beyond Obvious Discrimination: Unconscious Biases

While overt discrimination in pay for the exact same job is less common now, more subversive forms of bias persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. These include:
*   **Promotion Biases** Men tend to be promoted faster or apply for roles when they meet only 60% of the criteria, whereas women often wait until they meet 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>. Men are also more likely to be promoted with "stretch opportunities" without ticking all boxes, while women face a higher threshold to prove themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.
*   **Discretionary Bonuses** In professional services, where base pay might be fixed, discretionary bonuses can introduce imbalances in payments between men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>.
*   **Perception of Confidence** Women demonstrating confidence or asking for pay rises may be perceived negatively ("she's a bit full of herself") compared to men, who are expected to be aggressive and steward their own careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.

## Strategies for Change

Addressing these systemic issues requires a multi-faceted approach:

### Organizational Responsibility
*   **Targets and [[quotas_and_representation_in_the_workplace | Quotas]]** Implementing [[quotas_and_representation_in_the_workplace | quotas]] and diversity targets can ensure diverse individuals are in positions of power, leading to better outcomes for diverse working communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>.
*   **Accountability** Tying leaders' remuneration and bonuses to meeting diversity rankings can drive change, as "if it isn't measured, it doesn't matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.
*   **Transparency** Companies should examine and disclose their [[gender_equality_in_australia_and_globally | gender pay gap]] data to their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

### Individual Action and Advocacy
*   **"Corporate Entrepreneurship"** Employees can actively seek ways to improve the company they work for, focusing on community benefits and flexible working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.
*   **"Just Ask"** Young people entering the workforce have significant power and should not hesitate to ask questions about company operations, such as [[gender_equality_in_australia_and_globally | climate-friendly practices]] or [[gender_equality_in_australia_and_globally | gender pay gaps]]. The worst outcome is a "no," but a "yes" might be more frequent than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
*   **Navigating the System** Individuals, particularly women, must learn to navigate the existing system and build confidence to pursue opportunities, even as broader systemic changes are sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>.

>[!info] Fixing the System, Not Just the Women
>While encouraging women to "lean in" and have more confidence (as suggested by Sheryl Sandberg's *Lean In*) is part of the solution, it's crucial to acknowledge that the system itself treats women differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>. Changing unconscious biases and structural impediments is equally, if not more, important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.

## The Role of Generations in Driving Change

There is growing momentum for a new economic system where profit is linked more closely to positive impact, and behaviors that damage the planet or create [[gender_equality_in_australia_and_globally | inequality]] are penalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>. This shift is being driven by younger generations, who, as consumers and employees, are demanding ethical manufacturing, fair trade, and investments aligned with their values, even if it means higher costs or fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.

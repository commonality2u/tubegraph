Quotas, also referred to as temporary special measures in a global setting, are a highly debated topic in the discussion of [[Addressing Gender Inequality in the Workplace | gender equality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>. They are temporary measures put in place to achieve a legitimate outcome, such as [[Gender equality in Australia and globally | gender equality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.

## The Debate: Equality of Opportunity vs. Equality of Outcome

The concept of quotas often brings up the debate between equality of opportunity and equality of outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.
Initially, some might be against quotas, believing that equality of outcome should not be forced and the focus should solely be on equality of opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>. However, perspectives can change, particularly when observing the lack of female representation in traditionally male-dominated fields like finance, where visible leaders and support systems are needed for women to feel included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

## Arguments for Quotas

Advocates for quotas, like Elizabeth Broderick, argue for their necessity in certain situations:
*   **Addressing Lack of Progress** Quotas are considered when other strategies, such as cultural change, shifting social norms, and encouraging women into STEM fields, are not yielding sufficient progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.
*   **Equal Aptitude and Merit** The fundamental belief is that men and women possess equal aptitude and merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.
*   **Reimagining Normality** Quotas help to "reimagine what normal looks like" and what a gender-equal world would entail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. They are temporary and designed to be removed once a 50% representation is achieved, as the new norm would then be established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.
*   **Active and Intentional Inclusion** Historically, many institutions have been invented and largely run by men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. While strong in the past, these models are becoming outdated as the [[Hiring strategies and identifying talent | talent pool]] has changed, with the majority of university graduates now being female (around 60% in Australia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. If organizations do not intentionally and actively include women, the existing system will unintentionally exclude them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. Quotas serve as a mechanism for this active inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>.
*   **Addressing Systemic Exclusion** Equality of opportunity alone is often insufficient because the opportunities presented are frequently based on a male life's trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. Alongside quotas, it is crucial to change the structures, systems, and beliefs within organizations to allow both men and women to thrive equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.

## Addressing Concerns

One common counter-argument against quotas suggests that men and women might be naturally inclined towards certain types of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. However, this is often attributed to social conditioning, as boys and girls are conditioned differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. Paradoxically, some countries with lower levels of [[Gender equality in Australia and globally | gender equality]] than Australia, such as Saudi Arabia, have higher numbers of women entering engineering and STEM fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. Women in these fields often enter due to purpose, aiming to shape a better world, rather than solely for higher salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. Therefore, changing organizational culture is as important as increasing female graduates in STEM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

## Personal Choice and Human Rights

Ultimately, the goal is not to enforce a 50/50 split if, hypothetically, there was perfect equality of opportunity and differences still persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. [[Balancing Corporate Roles and Personal Values | Personal choice]], dignity, and respect are at the heart of human rights, allowing individuals to choose where they live and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. The aim is to create a world where gender stereotypes do not limit either men or women, as they can "imprison" both equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.

## Forming the Partnership: A Natural Evolution

The co-founders, Sain and Adam, met while on exchange in Utrecht, Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. They ended up living together due to housing difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Within three weeks of living together, they became inseparable, sharing activities like going to the gym, parties, excelling in school, and discussing business ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. They felt a deep connection, with aligned interests in startups, gym, and working out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. Their relationship was characterized by depth and no holding back in discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

Upon returning to Sydney, they started a podcast out of boredom, initially recording their exchange experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. The podcast began organically, focused on interviewing interesting people across diverse subjects, including political activists, bodybuilders, and positive psychology experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. This early phase was a "vehicle to discover the world and be curious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

As their interests shifted towards technology, their content reflected this, leading them to interview entrepreneurs like Tim Fung from Airtasker and Venture Capitalists such as Adam Milgrom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Milgrom's discussion about [[challenges_and_strategies_in_venture_investing | Venture Capital]] as a way of impacting people resonated with their desire to do something socially impactful through a for-profit route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

## The Existential Crossroads

For a period, both co-founders envisioned careers in [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | Venture Capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. Sain worked in [[challenges_and_strategies_in_venture_investing | Venture Capital]] at AirTree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>, while Adam, a year behind, was in Consulting at Deloitte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. Their time outside of work was consistently spent engaging with the tech industry, reading newsletters, listening to podcasts, and even angel investing in tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

A pivotal conversation occurred in their shared house where they debated pursuing the podcast full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. Adam was keen on taking a "gap year" inspired by Tim Ferriss's personal MBA concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. Sain, however, felt a personal insecurity about not having achieved enough in his career yet, especially with the tech crash, and wanted to gain more [[challenges_and_strategies_in_venture_investing | VC]] experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>. This led to tension, as their paths were diverging, with one considering moving to New York and the other to the States for [[challenges_and_strategies_in_venture_investing | VC]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. They recognized that their mid-20s were "exponential years" to make significant decisions, and they didn't want to regret not building something together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>.

### The Breakthrough Moment

Adam experienced a moment of clarity during a walk to work, realizing they shouldn't just start a podcast but a large-scale tech media company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>. He envisioned a company worth over $100 million, impacting millions, recruiting others, and integrating ideas like edtech ventures and customer intelligence platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>.

Sain initially felt scared by this ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>. While he had always dreamed of founding a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>, seeing his father's struggles as a founder and meeting many [[founder_experiences_and_strategies_in_tech_startups | founders]] in his [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | VC]] role made him fearful of the high failure rate and personal sacrifices (e.g., mortgaging houses, losing relationships) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>. They also had an "artificial constraint" of thinking they had to bootstrap the venture, not considering external funding for a podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>.

The shift in mindset to think big and unconstrained, beyond just a podcast, made the idea feel "really really right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>. This became their "dream life" and "dream company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:36:00">[21:36:00]</a> **Adam:** "There's something like spiritual about that moment when something just feels like even in the worst case scenario that this doesn't work this will be incredible like an incredible experience."

## The Vision: Kindling

They launched Kindling, an APAC-focused tech media company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>. Their goal is to partner with and create the best tech media globally, including podcasts, newsletters, and TikToks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:28:00">[29:28:00]</a>. They recognize the increasing accessibility of media creation and the many undiscovered niches, especially in Asia Pacific for tech stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:44:00">[29:44:00]</a>.

Beyond media, they aim to leverage data and insights gathered through their content to build "brilliant things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>. They are passionate about the EdTech space and customer intelligence platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:36:00">[30:36:00]</a>. Their strategy is distribution-first, drawing inspiration from creators like Logan Paul and Mr. Beast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>. They believe in the growing "parasocial relationship" between creators and their audience, surpassing traditional media influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:33:00">[31:33:00]</a>. This trend, combined with AI tools simplifying software development, emphasizes the importance of distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:22:00">[32:22:00]</a>.

## Current [[Challenges and strategies in startup culture | Startup Culture]] and Future Outlook

The co-founders acknowledge the significant sacrifices involved in this venture, including drastically reduced pay and moving back in with parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:04:00">[28:04:00]</a>. They've also cut down on social activities and alcohol to focus on running and working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:00]</a>. Despite these hardships, the endeavor "still feels right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:30:00">[28:30:00]</a>. They are aware of the responsibilities that come with taking on funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:00">[28:34:00]</a>.

They are committed to a "building public" series, sharing the raw, vulnerable, behind-the-scenes story of their company, including personal aspects of their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:18:00">[34:18:00]</a>. They intend this to be a very long journey, implicitly signing up for 10+ years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:31:00">[35:31:00]</a>. This experience is their "life's work," which is both fulfilling and fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:37:00">[35:37:00]</a>.

The co-founders, Sain and Adam, chronicle their journey of launching their "dream company" Kindling, a tech media venture, after quitting their corporate jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. They aim to provide a "raw and real" behind-the-scenes look at the highs and lows of building a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Genesis of Kindling

Sain and Adam met on exchange in the Netherlands, where they quickly formed a deep friendship and shared interests in startups, fitness, and self-improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This bond led them to start a podcast upon returning to Sydney, initially driven by curiosity to interview interesting people from diverse fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Over time, their content evolved to reflect their growing interest in technology, leading them to interview entrepreneurs and Venture Capital (VC) professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

A significant turning point for their podcast's reach was an interview with former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which generated millions of views on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This exposure, coupled with their increasing engagement with the tech and VC world (including exploring [[angel_investing_and_networking_strategies | Angel Investing]] and forming a mini-fund to invest in tech companies), solidified their passion for the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### The Decision to Go All-In

Initially, the idea of pursuing the podcast full-time was considered a "gap year" for personal learning, similar to Tim Ferriss's "personal MBA" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. However, a moment of clarity led to a bolder vision: transforming their podcast into a large-scale tech media and data company, aspiring to be worth over $100 million and impact millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

This shift in mindset involved overcoming self-imposed limitations:
- **Overcoming the "Bootstrapped" Mindset:** They initially believed they had to bootstrap the venture, but realized that for a larger vision, [[fundraising_strategies_and_honesty | fundraising]] would be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. They recognized that while a simple podcast shouldn't raise money, a bigger endeavor could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.
- **Departing from VC Investment Models:** Sain realized that his venture capital background had constrained his thinking to businesses that could generate multi-billion dollar outcomes to "return a big fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. He learned that value can be created by focusing on impacting millions of people and then devising monetization strategies, rather than solely building enterprise SaaS companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.
- **Embracing Big Thinking:** They acknowledged that they hadn't truly given themselves permission to think big until this pivotal moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

## Business Growth Strategies: A Media and Data Company

Kindling's strategy involves two core parts:

1.  **Building APAC's Leading Tech Media Company:**
    *   **Multi-Platform Content:** Beyond their initial podcast, Kindling aims to produce tech media content across podcasts, newsletters, TikToks, and any other consumer platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.
    *   **Niche Focus:** They identified a significant opportunity in the Asia Pacific (APAC) and India regions for tech stories and entrepreneurs, a less saturated market compared to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
    *   **Educational and Inspirational Content:** Their goal is to share stories that both inspire and educate people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

2.  **Leveraging Media for Data and Insights:**
    *   **Distribution First Model:** Inspired by creators like Logan Paul (Prime) and Mr. Beast (chocolate brand), Kindling plans to build a company that is "distribution first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. This addresses a common challenge for startups with great products but underdeveloped [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_execution_and_marketing | distribution strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
    *   **Media as a Data Source:** They recognize that media generates not just eyeballs but also valuable "information, data, and insights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. This data can be leveraged to build other ventures, such as those in the EdTech space or customer intelligence platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.
    *   **Parasocial Relationships:** A key bet is the growing importance of parasocial relationships between creators and their audience, which can become a powerful distribution channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.
    *   **AI Integration:** The rise of AI tools making software development easier emphasizes the increasing importance of distribution and creator relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

### Intentionality and Vision

While their initial podcast growth was organic and driven by curiosity, their new venture involves becoming "really really structured and intentional" with their [[fundraising_strategies_and_honesty | fundraising]] efforts and overall strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:11]</a>. They believe in the "exponential years" of their mid-twenties for deep focus and hard work, aiming for a "life's work" that extends 10+ years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>.

> "I think we're both very conscious about the finite nature of our lives and what we do with it and like the impact we can put on right." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>

They acknowledge the sacrifices involved, such as reduced income and personal life adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>, but maintain that the pursuit of their "dream company" feels right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. The combination of creative, soulful work with the rigor of building a large company fuels their [[rapid_growth_strategies_for_startups | rapid growth]] ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.

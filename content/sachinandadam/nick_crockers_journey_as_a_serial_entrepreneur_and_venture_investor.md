Nick Crocker is recognized as one of the "OGs" of the Australian Venture Capital (VC) industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. He is a three-times exited founder and has served as the CEO of Startmate, a significant community-based organization in the Australian startup ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Since 2016, he has been a partner at Blackbird Ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Early Life and Influences

Crocker describes his intellectual curiosity as a core aspect of his personality, one he only fully realized in the last year or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. His father was a woodworker who made fine furniture, instilling in Crocker a passion for craft and aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Personality tests consistently show his high appreciation for aesthetics, including great music, furniture, and timeless art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Crocker also notes a strong sense of "exaggerated self-belief" or "unjustified" entitlement, which he attributes to his mother's subtle encouragement that it was "okay to feel entitled to good things happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. This confidence played a critical role in his career, allowing him to pursue opportunities that were seemingly "two to five levels above where I deserve to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

## Unconventional Career Path: From Law to Journalism

Despite his current role, Crocker initially studied law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This decision, made at 17, was driven by a "status-seeking" mindset, as he was ambitious but not strong in math or science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. He pursued political science with minors in Spanish and peace and conflict studies, but didn't "vibe" with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. He never practiced as a lawyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

At 23, feeling "miserable" in a government job in the Department of Tourism, Fair Trading, Wine Industry Development, and Women, he sought to meet inspirational people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. He realized that journalists could talk to anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. He persistently pitched the editor of the Sunday Mail for three months until he was given a column profiling individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This role allowed him to interview a diverse range of people, from politicians to puppeteers, as he secretly tried to determine "could I be this person one day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Entering the Startup World and Early Ventures

The pivotal moment came when he interviewed three entrepreneurs working out of an electricity substation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. He was struck by their autonomy and self-definition, realizing that starting a business was a viable path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This revelation led him to a place where he could express his ambition without fear of judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. He moved to New York at 25, drawn to an environment where "no version of ambition that could scare people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

Within a month of this encounter, he took a job as the first and only employee (CEO) of a startup that helped independent artists get their music onto iTunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. He then started an agency called Native Digital, which consulted for the music industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. His approach was "scrappy and resourceful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>, using interns to connect with artists on MySpace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. A key success was writing a free guide on how to market music online, which resonated with both artists and record labels, leading to job offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. This document "kicked off" his music tech career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

He later spun out a music website called We Are Hunted from the agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. After selling it, he moved to New York and worked for Zach Klein, founder of College Humor and co-founder of Vimeo, a person he deeply admired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. He initially offered to work for free to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>, and was offered a full-time position within two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

Following this, he co-founded Sessions, which was acquired by MyFitnessPal and later by Under Armour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. He spent three years as an operator at MyFitnessPal and Under Armour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.

### Reflecting on Entrepreneurial Success

Crocker candidly admits that his three exited startups were "not successful really on any meaningful scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>, as none of them lasted more than about three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. He defines true success as "building something enduring" that can be passed on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. He finds it healthy to look back at his past self with a "sense of embarrassment," as it signifies rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

## Transition to Venture Capital: Blackbird Ventures

Crocker's relationship with Blackbird Ventures began early in the Australian startup scene. He first met Niki Scevak around 2010-2011, when Scevak was developing the idea for Startmate, an initiative Crocker had also envisioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. Crocker became an early Startmate mentor and invested $5,000 into the first Startmate cohort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

His company, Sessions, was one of Blackbird's very first investments, the third company they ever funded after Canva and Rolo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. Sessions was also the first company to return money to Blackbird, a small but significant return at the time, which meant a lot to him due to the 97 individual investors involved in the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.

In 2016, with his first son born, Crocker decided to move back to Australia from San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>. He was determined to work at Blackbird and "find a way to be indispensable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>. He convinced them to let him be a "venture partner," attending partner meetings and helping Startmate founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. His top-ranked mentorship at Startmate, surpassing Niki Scevak, proved his value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. His entry into Blackbird was "by osmosis more than like a job description," eventually becoming a partner and taking a board seat before officially joining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>.

### Investment Philosophy and Talent Assessment

Crocker states that he has "never been excited about investing in areas," but rather in "Founders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. He describes an "undeniable" rush of emotion when he meets a founder he's about to invest in, often within the first four minutes of a meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. He believes that while many optimize for metrics like MRR and ARR, success in VC is often optimized for the "art of how you make someone feel in the first 60 seconds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.

He attributes his ability to assess people to his diverse life experiences:
*   Growing up in a country town and navigating complex social dynamics on bus rides to school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.
*   Living in France, Mexico, New York, and San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.
*   A "natural tune in to people" and a "massive natural curiosity" inherited from his GP mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.

He constantly "sizes someone up," trying to understand "who is this person and what makes them tick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. This intuitive approach is his core strength, which he tempers by seeking input from his diverse team at Blackbird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.

Regarding young venture investors, Crocker believes they can succeed because venture capital requires only "one good investment a decade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>. He highlights that early relationships with future successful founders, like Blackbird's first investment in Canva, can drive success regardless of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>. He tracks his own performance by money invested vs. current value and focuses on "deal flow quality" and personal "measures of progress" since cash returns can take years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>.

## Australian Tech Ecosystem

Crocker expresses surprise at the immense growth of the Australian startup ecosystem, noting an "explosion of funding, founders, and then community" since 2016-2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. He observes a cultural shift where brilliant minds are choosing to become founders instead of pursuing traditional careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.

He believes the ecosystem is performing "better than most people realize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>, citing Australia's large superannuation pool (potentially the fifth largest sovereign wealth fund) as a key differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>. If even a small percentage of this wealth is invested in startups, it can create "billions of dollars" for job creation and R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>. He views the first ten years (2012-2022) as an "A plus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>, but acknowledges the "weight of responsibility" to ensure the next decade is equally successful given the billions waiting to be deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.

While acknowledging concerns like tall poppy syndrome and risk aversion, Crocker doesn't see them as major roadblocks. He believes the startup community largely supports its successful members and that external skepticism forces the industry to "justify ourselves" by highlighting its creation of "amazing new high-quality jobs" and its net positive impact on the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>. He emphasizes the "circularity of success," where superannuation funds benefit directly from startup growth, involving "normal people" like hospitality workers, doctors, and nurses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>.

## Personal Insights

Crocker highlights the importance of his relationship with his wife, Jules, in providing a "warm blanket of emotional security" and a foundational "sense of worthiness" that allows him to pursue ambitious goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. He credits her forgiveness and willingness to support him through challenges like four years of a long-distance relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.

He manages his emotional well-being through daily meditation and exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>, abstaining from alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>, and a weekly practice of writing down his experiences to process them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.

He often repeats the affirmation "you are enough" or "if I bring my whole self to this situation, I have everything I need and I'm already enough" to navigate stressful times, helping him "drop the unnecessary stress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.

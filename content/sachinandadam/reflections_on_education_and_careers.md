The hosts of the "Satchmo and Adam Show" reflected on their personal and professional growth over 53 podcast episodes, discussing their evolving interests, career paths, and insights gained from their experiences and guests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Personal and Professional Growth

The podcast journey, which began unintentionally, has led to significant personal transformation for the hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. They noted that since starting the podcast, their interests have become more honed into specific areas, particularly entrepreneurship, technology, and investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This focus aligns with their long-term goal of starting a venture capital fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

One host, reflecting on his university experience, stated that his early years focused on self-awareness and foundational social experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. In later years, informed by the podcast, he learned more about the world in a practical way, including major industries and career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## The Role of External Education

The hosts emphasized that much of their education has come from sources outside of traditional university settings, such as talking to people, online blogs, Twitter, YouTube, and podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. They actively create a "funnel of information" to stay updated on new ideas and trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Their newly launched website serves as a resource aggregator for books, podcasts, and newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

They noted a shift from general self-development topics to more specific interests like investing and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. While acknowledging the foundational importance of self-development concepts like the growth mindset, they feel they have "been there, done that" and now seek more specialized knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## [[networking_and_career_advice_for_university_students | Networking and Career Exploration]]

A key method for exploring different career paths was through internships, which provided practical, hands-on experience within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Informal networking, specifically "coffees with new people" every two weeks, was invaluable for scoping out different jobs and industries in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The hosts found that meeting leaders and entrepreneurs, such as Evan Wong of Checkbox AI, provided significant energy and inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. They also learned about "safe risks" in entrepreneurship, where individuals have a plan B and savings before committing fully to a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Another impressive guest was Peter Corbett, Head of Monitor Deloitte in Sydney, who demonstrated a balanced and holistic life despite a demanding corporate position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Similarly, Harry Guinness, who transitioned from professional rugby to foreign policy advising and starting a think tank, exemplified a diverse and fascinating career narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Meeting Adam Milgram, who started Australia's first social impact venture capital firm, codified the hosts' own career aspirations towards venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. They decided that consulting would be the right immediate step after university to accumulate skills and network before pursuing their venture capital vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This iterative approach to [[career_decision_making | career decision making]] involves continuously talking to people and reflecting on desired work and future visions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## [[reflections_on_intuition_and_decisionmaking | Decision-Making and Risk Management]]

When discussing [[reflections_on_intuition_and_decisionmaking | decision-making]], particularly in investing, the hosts highlighted the importance of risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. They emphasized understanding and managing personal psychological biases, such as fear-driven selling during market drops or confirmation bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>. Having friends who challenge one's thesis is seen as a key way to mitigate confirmation bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

The concept of conviction is also crucial; the more confident one is in a decision (e.g., an investment thesis), the less emotion will factor into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. For long-term investing, they prioritize knowing the underlying trends and having high conviction rather than market timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.

## [[advice_for_young_people_and_career_choices | Advice for Young People]]

For first-year university students, the primary advice is to "get coffees" (or tea/water) with many experienced individuals, both within and outside their immediate academic circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. This provides immense value in scoping out career paths, internships, and general success strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.

A deeper, more personal piece of advice for anyone aged 18 or older is to "sort out your own baggage" by reflecting on past trauma or limiting factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. Unpacking these experiences, potentially with the help of a psychologist or by being vulnerable with friends, can prevent carrying half-hearted intentions into future years and lead to more genuine success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>. The importance of self-reflection, understanding one's predispositions, and defining personal values was highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>.

**Key Self-Reflection Questions:**
*   What do I want my friends and family to say about me at my funeral? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>
*   What does a perfect day look like? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>
*   What kind of life do I want to live? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>
::

It's important to avoid being constrained by what others want in their lives and to instead write down and stick to personal values and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>. The [[the_tension_between_industriousness_and_selfreflection | tension between industriousness and self-reflection]] was acknowledged, as deep reflection could potentially change one's drive if it reveals motivations rooted in ego or unhealthy competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>.

## The Twenties: Foundational or Exploratory?

One host views his twenties as a foundational period for "building blocks" of knowledge, skills, and networks, rather than a time for "mucking around and chilling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>. He emphasizes intentional, directional exploration, aligning with his goal of achieving complete freedom and independence by his 30s and 40s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

The other host, while agreeing with the intentional mindset, emphasizes being "risk-on" in his twenties due to fewer constraints compared to later life when families are often formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>. This includes desires to start a company, engage in extensive travel (e.g., six months to a year, a world trip), and live in another city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>. He aims for experiences that provide energy and excitement, even if it prolongs financial freedom by a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.

Both acknowledged that their personal journeys and evolving interests have led them to a more concentrated approach to their careers, moving beyond purely social pursuits to more intentional learning and networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Their commitment to the podcast as a long-term project reflects this dedication to continuous learning and community building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

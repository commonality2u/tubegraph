Rex Woodbury, a Partner at Index Ventures and author of "Digital Native", is deeply fascinated by [[cultural_movements_and_market_trends | consumer behavior]] and [[investing_in_consumer_internet_companies | consumer investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. His core interest lies in human behavior, culture, and media, specifically how people interact with each other and with various forms of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This passion drives his work in [[Venture Capital and Consumer Investment | venture capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

## The Digital Native Generation

The current generation, Gen Z, is the first truly "digitally native" generation, having come of age entirely online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. This has led to a fascinating relationship with technology, marked by both positive and challenging aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

### Impact of Smartphones and Social Media
There is an ongoing, important conversation about how smartphones and social media are influencing mental health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. Charts show a strong correlation between the inflection of smartphone and social media adoption around 2009-2010 and a worsening of mental health among teen girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. Other contributing factors to mental health issues and loneliness include increased homework stress and car-centric cities making in-person meetups difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

### Optimism in Technology
Despite these challenges, Woodbury remains a "perpetual Tech Optimist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. He believes that while new technologies always have positive and negative externalities, the net outcome is usually positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. History shows a pattern of anxiety surrounding new technologies, from the printing press to TV, yet progress continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

Technology, especially the internet, makes the world global and introduces people to new ideas and communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. For example, the "Worthy" organization, which matches LGBTQ+ mentors with mentees, grew entirely through Instagram, allowing individuals to find support and belonging that might not exist in their local communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.

## Changing Trends in Online Attention

The way people spend their attention online is shifting:

*   **Shift from acquaintances to strangers**: Social media 1.0 focused on connecting with existing friends and classmates (e.g., Facebook, Instagram). Newer platforms like TikTok, Discord, and Reddit increasingly introduce users to strangers, often around shared interests, fostering community and belonging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
*   **Rise of parasocial relationships**: Users are developing more parasocial relationships with creators and public figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.
*   **Games as social networks**: The next generation of social networks is likely to resemble games like Minecraft or Roblox, blurring the lines between creation and play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.

## The Evolution of Work and the Creator Economy

Gen Z's perceived jadedness towards capitalism is contrasted with the vast array of new alternatives to traditional employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. There are now many ways to earn a living and [[cultural_movements_and_market_trends | dictate your life online]] that weren't available to previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

[!NOTE|New digitally native work opportunities]
Examples of new ways to make a living online include:
*   TikTokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>
*   YouTubers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>
*   Live stream sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>
*   Boutique store owners on platforms like Flagship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>
*   Community managers on Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>
*   Roblox developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>

Woodbury views the "Creator Economy" broadly, defining it as forms of digitally native work and job creation platforms, rather than a niche category of startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. Companies that enable people to make a living, even indirectly, often become the largest businesses; for instance, Amazon enables far more people to earn a living as third-party sellers than it directly employs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>. Similarly, YouTube supports more individuals earning a living than are employed at its headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>.

## Investment Strategy in Consumer Trends

[[Venture Capital and Consumer Investment | Investing in consumer internet companies]] requires a nuanced approach:

*   **Broad Definition of Consumer**: Woodbury thinks of "consumer" broadly, encompassing human behavior, and notes that many successful investments are B2B2C or purely B2B, rather than just direct-to-consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. Pure consumer social or marketplace outcomes can be very large but are rarer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>.
    *   Examples include a B2B marketplace for creator storefronts (Flagship) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a> and e-commerce enablement companies like Beam, which embed social impact into checkout experiences, appealing to Gen Z's values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.
*   **Change Mindset, not Thesis-Driven**: Rather than being solely "thesis-driven," investors should adopt a "change mindset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. This means having a pulse on major "tectonic shifts" in the economy and human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   **Entrepreneur-Led Investing**: The focus should be on identifying exceptional entrepreneurs who are likely living years into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. Learning from their unique insights is crucial for [[investing_in_startups_and_earlystage_companies | startup growth and investor dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>.

### Identifying Exceptional Entrepreneurs
When identifying the best entrepreneurs, Woodbury looks for:

1.  **Founder-Market Fit**: The best entrepreneurs possess an "unfair advantage" in their chosen space, often stemming from a lived experience of the pain point or opportunity they are addressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Examples include a gamer building a gaming company, a musician creating Patreon, a non-profit founder starting Beam, or an Instagram employee understanding Creator Commerce issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.
2.  **Clarity of Thought**: Exceptional entrepreneurs have the ability to understand the "order of operations" and how things will unfold to build a large company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.
3.  **Unique Insight**: In the best meetings, entrepreneurs share a new perspective or an insight into the world that the investor hadn't considered before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. It's important for investors to avoid confirmation bias and seek genuinely novel ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.

### Avoiding Biases
Woodbury emphasizes the dangers of biases in [[Venture Capital and Consumer Investment | venture capital]]:

*   **Demographic Bias**: There's a problem in the industry with biases against minority or female investors and founders, who often lack the same networks as the majority of successful founders (often white men) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.
*   **Experience Bias**: It's dangerous to be "snobbish" and only meet with entrepreneurs from top-tier companies (e.g., Stripe, Figma), as this filters out potentially great founders from non-conventional backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>. The world is constantly changing, and what failed in the past (e.g., a disappearing photo app before Snapchat) might succeed with a different founder or in a changed market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>.
*   **Calcified Biases**: Older investors may develop "calcified biases" from seeing many business models and pitches, which can hinder their ability to recognize new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>. It's crucial to continuously check biases and remain open-minded to how critical things have changed or if a person is special enough to transform a sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.

[!INFO|Australian Example]
A survey of successful Australian outlier founders revealed no single trend or pattern recognition in their backgrounds; every person's journey was non-obvious and non-conventional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>. Canva, founded by Melanie Perkins, is cited as a prime example of an incredible entrepreneur with perfect product timing from a non-obvious background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>. This reinforces that exciting businesses and entrepreneurs can emerge from anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Brand Building for Young Investors

For young, upcoming investors, Woodbury advises:

*   **Leverage unique skills and interests**: Everyone has different "superpowers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.
*   **Learn in public**: Writing weekly, tweeting, and especially long-form writing can act as a "forcing function" to synthesize ideas and stress-test them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>. It can also create serendipitous connections and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.
*   **Focus on deep domain expertise**: In a crowded business world, it's beneficial to build deep expertise in one area, even if it means initially being less diversified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>. However, a balance is needed, aiming to be "t-shaped" – having a broad range of skills up to a certain level, but excelling in a few key areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
*   **Cultivate a strong work ethic**: Success often comes from outworking others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.

## Future Trends in Consumer Investment

One chart that consistently preoccupies Woodbury shows price changes in the US over the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. While the cost of TVs and software has plummeted (by 85-90%), the price of housing, education, and healthcare has skyrocketed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:59">[00:52:59]</a>. He believes this is an "untenable path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>.

[!INFO|Future Investment Opportunity]
Woodbury sees significant opportunities for [[Future trends in impact measurement and investment | innovation and entrepreneurship]] to have an impact on these more regulated but deeply impactful sectors (housing, education, healthcare) to make them more affordable and accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.

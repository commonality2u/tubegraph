From: [[sachinandadam]] <br/> 

Elizabeth Yin is the co-founder of Hustle Fund, one of the most well-known pre-seed funds in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Her diverse experience includes entrepreneurship and working at Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Driving Motivation and Mission
Yin's motivation for founding Hustle Fund stemmed from a desire to build a "huge business" that felt like her "life's work," something she could be excited about for 30 to 40 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. After a "modest exit" from her previous advertising-related company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, she wanted to find a deeply fulfilling venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

She realized her passion lay with Founders and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, having experienced the challenges firsthand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. She identified three major problems Founders often face: lack of capital, knowledge, and networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The mission of Hustle Fund is to empower great Founders by providing access to these three crucial elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. While often seen as a VC fund, Hustle Fund aims to do much more than just provide capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Early Influences & Career Beginnings
Yin does not believe being a Founder is "hereditary" or "in your blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. For her, entrepreneurship was a "byproduct of time and place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. She grew up in Silicon Valley during the dot-com boom in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Even as a high school student, she had opportunities to get involved with startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

Her first significant exposure to startups was in the fall of 1996, when her friend's cousin, Tony, asked them to help with his startup during winter break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. They helped build chairs, tables, and even made Ethernet cables by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The chaotic yet energetic environment, with people constantly working, eating pizza, and meeting clients, left her with the impression that it was "really cool Creative Energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. She later learned that the company sold to Microsoft for a purported couple hundred million dollars, and Tony was the late Tony Hsieh, previously CEO of Zappos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This experience of seeing a startup's journey from chaos to a big exit was influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## International Experiences and Adaptability
Early in her [[life_and_career_adaptability | career]], Yin had several international internships, including in Switzerland, Japan, and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. She states these experiences shaped her opinions and understanding of businesses, though at the time, she simply saw them as adventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

A notable story involves her job in Tokyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. In her final year of university, she wanted to visit business schools on the East Coast but didn't want to pay for the plane ticket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. She won a contest for a free trip to Boston, which required her to attend a job fair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. At this fair, she landed a job in Tokyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Despite having no intention of working there or getting a job, she took it after not getting into business school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

A month after landing in Tokyo, she was essentially fired, with the option to move to US headquarters or leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. She negotiated to stay for a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. She admits she "was not qualified for that job" and "didn't speak much Japanese" for what was meant to be a Japanese-speaking role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. She believes this "failure" opened new doors and provided valuable learning experiences that shaped her perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

## Time at Google
Yin joined Google in 2007, when the company already had 20,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Unlike earlier employees who found it more entrepreneurial, she experienced challenges due to the company's rapid growth and flat hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. She found the culture could be chaotic, with constant "whiplash" from numerous projects and executives weighing in at the last minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. While acknowledging the high competence of her peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, she felt it wasn't an environment where she could thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. Her time at Google taught her "how not to grow a company" culturally, despite Google's overall product success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Entrepreneurship: Launchbit
After Google, Yin decided to start a company in late 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>, despite Sequoia Capital's "Rest in Peace Good Times" memo warning of a brutal capital market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. She decided to proceed because she couldn't predict a "better opening" time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

She co-founded Launchbit, an advertising-related company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Initially, she found it difficult to raise money due to market conditions, but this was a "blessing in disguise" as she was "naive" and "had no idea what [she] was doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. At the time, there was little readily available knowledge online about how to start a company, unlike today's Lean Startup frameworks and popular blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

> [!quote] Startup Mistakes at Launchbit
> Yin made many common mistakes, including:
> *   **Not validating demand:** They spent months building a product "nobody wanted" without validating demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.
> *   **Not setting culture from the outset:** She realized the importance of building a strong company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Founders often hire based on skill set rather than personality fit for the company's mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. At Hustle Fund, for example, everyone must "really value kindness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
> *   **Lack of guidance:** She wishes she had more guidance on how to build a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

Launchbit eventually had a "modest exit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Yin explains that the decision to exit is complex and often deviates from initial plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. Professionally, it depends on whether the company is on the right trajectory to continue winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. In the ads business, which is "cutthroat," consolidation is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. Personally, she felt the team culture was "a little bit off" and she was "getting jaded by the ads world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. They exited by partnering with another ad company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

## Transition to Investing: 500 Startups
Yin's transition into the investing world was gradual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. She first went to 500 Startups to mentor and advise startups, a natural step given her own entrepreneurial journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. She then ran their accelerator program for almost three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>, which included an investing role where she picked startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.

> [!info] Learning to Invest through Accelerators
> Yin believes working at an accelerator is one of the best ways to learn how to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. She oversaw 200 investments, providing "investing lessons on steroids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. Accelerators offer:
> *   Exposure to a large volume of companies ("the good, the bad, the ugly") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
> *   A "quicker cycle" and "tight feedback loop" on investment decisions, as investors see companies almost daily over several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. This contrasts with traditional VC, which has a long feedback loop of 5 to 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

## Founding Hustle Fund
In early 2017, Elizabeth Yin and her business partner Eric Bahn decided to start Hustle Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>. They chose investing as their primary business model because pre-seed Founders struggled to access capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. In 2017, there were very few true pre-seed investors in the US who would invest in "pre-revenue, a half-baked idea, and a half-baked product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. They saw this as an opportunity where they "could win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>.

> [!quote] Differentiating a VC Fund
> Initially, they had confidence in their qualifications as former Founders with exits and investing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>. However, they faced a "rude awakening" as thousands of funds exist, all pitching a similar asset class and model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. They went through about 20 iterations of their pitch to make it unique and differentiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.
>
> Their winning pitch highlighted:
> 1.  **Addressing a gap:** Not everyone has a "rich uncle" for pre-seed funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.
> 2.  **Global approach:** Investing in many companies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
> 3.  **Small initial checks & double-down model:** Providing small initial checks (e.g., $25k) and then doubling down at seed stage (20% of the time) after working closely with Founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>. This model of "deploying our Capital based on working with Founders rather than hearing them talk" was fairly differentiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.

## Investing Philosophy & Founder Traits
Hustle Fund looks for Founders with "speed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>, which is why their name is "hustle fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. The more experiments a Founder can run within a limited "runway," the greater their likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. The best Founders are adept at quickly identifying and executing on "top priority" experiments to de-risk their ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.

> [!info] Traits for "Speed of Execution"
> Speed of execution is a combination of factors that can be learned:
> *   **Learning Ability:** CEOs must wear many hats, so the quicker they learn new skills, the easier it is to conduct experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>.
> *   **Team Building:** Charisma to attract a great team to offset weaknesses, even with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>.
> *   **Prioritization:** Focusing on the single most important thing to figure out in the next 2-4 weeks, letting other tasks drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.
> *   **Frugality:** Being resourceful to stretch runway and dollars further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.
> *   **Sales Skills:** Convincing talent to work for less salary in exchange for equity, effectively "selling" the company's future value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

## Scaling Hustle Fund
Managing a large portfolio with a hands-on, value-add model requires significant support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>. Hustle Fund has about 30 people, more than typically expected for its fund size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>. This is possible because they have other business lines that generate revenue, allowing them to provide more resources to Founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>.

They have also built out extensive systems and processes, some with technology, to streamline operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. For example, they run workshops for many Founders simultaneously who share common problems like fundraising or customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>. Yin acknowledges that scaling processes and technology is crucial, which is ironic for a VC fund that invests in such things but often doesn't adopt them internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.

Yin focuses heavily on building a strong organizational culture, emphasizing kindness and ensuring new hires fit the team's personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>. This means constantly recruiting and marketing to potential job candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>.

## Building Brand & Customer Acquisition
From her experience at Launchbit, Yin learned the critical skill of customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. For Hustle Fund, customer acquisition is about "selling" the brand so Founders want to take their investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>. This still involves lead generation and continuous experimentation across various channels like Clubhouse, TikTok, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

Twitter proved particularly effective; internal analytics showed over half of company applications came from Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. This led them to "go hard on Twitter," tweeting daily and analyzing data to find effective topics, ultimately establishing a repeatable process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>.

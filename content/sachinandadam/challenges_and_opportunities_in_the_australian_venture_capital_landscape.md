Australia's venture capital (VC) landscape is dynamic, featuring a mix of large, established funds and smaller, specialized entities. This environment presents both unique challenges and opportunities for investors and founders alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

## Key Players and Market Dynamics

Jesse Wu, often considered a leading up-and-coming VC in Australia, highlights several aspects of the [[investing_in_australian_tech_startups | Australian venture capital landscape]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The ecosystem is experiencing a [[The evolution and impact of the Australian tech ecosystem | significant evolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

### Bifurcation of Funds
There is a clear bifurcation of funds:
*   **Large Funds**: These include firms with nearly a billion dollars under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Small, Differentiated Funds**: These are more specialized in their investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.

### Challenges for Large Funds
For larger funds, a "law of physics" in investment suggests that as funds grow, their multiples (returns on investment) compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Reasons for this compression include:
*   **High Bar for Wealth Creation**: To turn $1 billion into $5 billion, $4 billion of wealth needs to be created in Australian tech within an eight-year timeframe, which is a very high bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Optimization for Outliers**: Large funds must optimize for outlier "Power law companies" that can redeem many mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. This means taking on high execution risk, even if market risk is low due to large Total Addressable Market (TAM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.
*   **Missing Mid-Size Opportunities**: This focus on unicorns can lead to missing opportunities to invest in companies with a feasible $500 million to $1 billion outcome, which might offer 100x returns if the entry valuation is right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

### Opportunities for Specialized Funds
Funds with specialized strategies are well-positioned to capture opportunities that large funds might miss due to their structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

*   **EVP**: This fund specializes in B2B SaaS investments at Series A and beyond, occasionally late seed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. They track leading signals of product-market fit and scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. EVP emphasizes valuation discipline and invests in "boring" infrastructure or enabling plays, explicitly disagreeing with the power law as a central tenet of VC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. Their portfolio includes companies like SiteMinder, Deputy, and Heaps Normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
*   **Coventures (Maxine Minter)**: A new $5 million pre-seed fund led by Maxine Minter, it targets Australian founders with global business models that are not typically funded by Australian investors (e.g., consumer, hardware, health tech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. The goal is to provide initial funding to make these startups "legible" for US investors and connect them to US networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. This strategy offers a unique "Alpha" by leveraging global networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

## Growth and Future Outlook

The question of whether there are enough companies in the [[impact_of_the_startup_ecosystem_in_Australia | Australian tech ecosystem]] to sustain large funds like Blackbird, AirTree, or Square Peg is a common one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.
*   **Market Making**: Large funds, especially Blackbird, act as "market makers" for big ambition in Australia and New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. They provide a "huge pot of money" available for ambitious founders, encouraging individuals to build careers in Australia by showing there's no cap to how big they can go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.
*   **Proactive Ecosystem Development**: While some funds may raise reactively to capital availability rather than demand, the proactive stance is to invest in creating an ecosystem that produces enough companies to deploy the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. Programs that encourage entrepreneurs and the increasing number of young people considering startups over corporate jobs are positive signs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

## Afterwork's Unique Approach

Afterwork, where Jesse Wu is a partner, operates with a unique community-powered fund model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.
*   **Community-Powered Fund**: Starting with 25 people, Afterwork used to pool insights and provide a "Rolodex" of expertise to founders after making investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.
*   **Current Structure**: Now a professional fund of over $20 million with three full-time staff (Jesse, Alex, Adrian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   **"High Conviction Requires a Time Series"**: Afterwork's model involves relatively small initial checks ($100K to $400K) into 40-50 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. Founders are brought into their community of 120 people, allowing for a 360-degree view of their engagement and problem-solving abilities over a 12-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. This rich data informs high-conviction follow-on checks of $1 million to $1.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.
*   **Valuation Discipline**: While seeking to be "first believers" and secure super pro rata rights through value demonstration rather than strict terms, Afterwork maintains valuation discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. They will pass on deals that are valued too high relative to their stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a>.

## [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | Investor Perspectives and Founder Qualities]]

### What Makes a Good Investor?
Investors bring value through a "bird's eye view" of many companies and pitch decks, understanding generalities across the ecosystem, and identifying common pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>. They can provide frameworks for metrics and product-market fit benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. Investors are best viewed as coaches, providing a sounding board rather than direct mentors or operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

### Founder Storytelling vs. Metrics
Storytelling is a crucial skill for a CEO in functions like fundraising, hiring, selling, and motivating a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. However, for early-stage VC, over-indexing on how a founder's story makes one feel can be dangerous, leading to "systems one thinking" (intuition/emotion) over "systems two thinking" (logical, considered reasoning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. Stories can gloss over issues, misdirect, or create an illusion of inevitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>. It's important to ask questions that test the business's coherence, such as unit economics, which require numbers, not just narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>.

### Gaining Early Conviction
For initial checks, investors look for "organizational discipline," evident in how founders manage fundraising as a sales process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>. This includes clear communication, quick follow-ups, provision of necessary detail, and managing multiple funds simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>. It's about a founder's clarity on business priorities and focused energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:55">[00:38:55]</a>.

### [[Challenges and strategies in venture investing | Contrarian Investing]]
The [[challenges_and_strategies_in_venture_investing | Australian ecosystem]] presents a conundrum for small funds: initial contrarian bets often need to become sufficiently "consensus" for larger funds to follow on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>.
*   **Customer Personas**: To think differently, it's crucial to be guided by customer personas, especially those outside the VC "cut and thrust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>. Talking to subject matter experts or end-users (e.g., farmers for agri-tech, construction managers for construction tech) can help cut through industry noise and lead to clarity on genuine market needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. Afterwork's community helps facilitate this by connecting founders with diverse expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

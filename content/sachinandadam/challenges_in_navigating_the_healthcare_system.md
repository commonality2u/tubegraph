The healthcare system presents significant [[challenges_in_the_current_education_system | challenges]] for many individuals, often leading to personal stories of struggle and frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These issues were a key motivator for Georgia Hiotis (formerly Georgia via) and Kate Lamberis to co-found their startup, [[challenges_and_goals_of_the_healthcare_startup_human_health | Human Health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Common Systemic Issues
Healthcare systems are frequently described as problematic, with widespread personal and family experiences of difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Key issues highlighted include:
*   Misdiagnosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   A slow medical system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   A general lack of new [[the_role_of_technology_in_healthcare_improvement | technology and innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>

## Personal Motivations of Human Health Founders

The co-founders of [[challenges_and_goals_of_the_healthcare_startup_human_health | Human Health]], Kate Lamberis and Georgia Hiotis, were driven by deeply personal experiences with healthcare system failings.

### Kate Lamberis's Experiences
Kate's personal "why" for starting [[challenges_and_goals_of_the_healthcare_startup_human_health | Human Health]] was significantly influenced by her family's health journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Loss of Parents**: She lost her mother at 16 to an aggressive form of lung cancer and her father three years later to Parkinson's, leading to early exposure to chronic diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. These experiences first highlighted the issues within the Australian health and hospital system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Children's Health Struggles**: Her main experiences driving her motivation came from her children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>:
    *   **Daughter's Autism Diagnosis**: When her daughter was nearly two years old, she began exhibiting concerning symptoms like not talking, not responding to her name, stopping play, not sleeping, and crying constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. After waiting months for a diagnosis, she was eventually diagnosed with autism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Doctors suggested little could be done beyond speech therapy, with some even stating her daughter would spend her life in an institution and never talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This dismissal led Kate and her husband on a long journey of self-education and research to find alternative options for their daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   **Son's Similar Symptoms**: During COVID, Kate's son began to exhibit similar symptoms, including a distinctive rash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This experience, which was even more severe than her daughter's, solidified Kate's motivation to find solutions outside conventional healthcare paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. She realized that staying home wouldn't help her son because solutions simply didn't exist, prompting her to actively seek them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Georgia Hiotis's Experiences
Georgia's background heavily features family experiences with mental illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Family History of Mental Illness**: A significant portion of her family has struggled with serious mental illnesses, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and manic depression, making it a common aspect of her childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Personal Connection to Healthcare Issues**: Georgia's "why" for building [[challenges_and_goals_of_the_healthcare_startup_human_health | Human Health]] was revealed as she collaborated with Kate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. She expressed a strong desire to alleviate the despair felt by individuals receiving difficult diagnoses, aiming to remove the feeling of blame and isolation that can accompany such news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

## The Response to Challenges
The profound personal impact of these healthcare system [[challenges_in_the_current_education_system | challenges]] led Kate and Georgia to create [[challenges_and_goals_of_the_healthcare_startup_human_health | Human Health]]. Their aim was to develop a tool to help patients and caregivers track symptoms and treatments, learn what works, and effectively advocate for their care with providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Their vision resonated widely, leading to the largest pre-seed funding round in Australian history for an all-female founding team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

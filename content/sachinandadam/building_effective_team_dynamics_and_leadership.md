Georgia Vidler, co-founder of Human Health, an app that tracks treatments and symptoms for chronic diagnoses, emphasizes that [[Developing a startups company culture and team dynamics | building a company]] is an extension of its founders' beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Her approach to [[Leadership insights and lessons | leadership]] and team dynamics is deeply rooted in personal experiences and lessons learned from her previous roles.

## Early Influences and Career Path

Growing up in Newcastle, Georgia always felt a drive to "get out" and pursue a variety of interests, including art, music, and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. Her parents encouraged her to "try everything," fostering a mindset without limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. This upbringing instilled a desire to do "something meaningful for a lot of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.

A pivotal moment occurred in 2010-2011 when an internship led to an offer to work at a startup, diverting her from a planned career in advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. This experience, surrounded by "amazing young people building cool stuff," felt more aligned with her aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>.

## Leadership Lessons from Canva

Before co-founding Human Health, Georgia served as Director of Product at Canva, managing a team of 45 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. She considers Canva co-founder Mel Perkins a significant mentor, learning extensively from her on product development, [[The importance of team and hiring | team building]], and team motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.

Key lessons from Perkins include:
*   **Motivating around a Big Dream**: Perkins was highly skilled at uniting people around a large mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.
*   **Negotiating with Engineers**: Perkins's mastery in understanding and negotiating with engineering teams was a "very, very useful skill" for Georgia to observe and replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>.

## Building Human Health: Team Dynamics and Culture

### Motivating Teams Around a Mission
Georgia emphasizes the importance of making projects feel "cool" and like "a brand" that people want to be a part of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>. This involves:
*   Giving projects a "cool name," "cool logo," and "cool slogan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.
*   Focusing on three top priorities to ensure information is easily remembered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>.
*   Acknowledging that people want to belong to something that matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>. Her marketing background proved helpful in "packaging things up to mean a certain thing to someone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.

### The Co-Founder Relationship with Kate
Georgia and co-founder Kate share a "magical" and "yin and yang" dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>. They have many parallels in their lives and a deeply complementary relationship, which has strengthened as they've built the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>, highlighting the importance of [[Building and nurturing personal and professional relationships | strong co-founder relationships]].

Key complementary aspects include:
*   **Structure vs. Unstructured**: Kate is more structured, while Georgia is more unstructured, creating a balance where Georgia "causes chaos" and Kate "cleans it up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:00">[23:20:00]</a>.
*   **Shared Vision**: Despite differing approaches, they have never disagreed on the core vision for Human Health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>.
*   **Roles**: Kate prefers running meetings and focusing on data structures (backend product), while Georgia enjoys social events and the product's look, feel, and user experience (frontend product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:59:00">[23:59:00]</a>.

### Company Values: Fixing Systems, Not Symptoms
Human Health's core value, "fix systems not symptoms," applies not only to healthcare but also to [[Developing a startups company culture and team dynamics | team building]]. This means getting to the root cause of a problem rather than just addressing its surface-level effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:06:00">[35:06:00]</a>. For example, if a team is ineffective, the solution isn't necessarily to add more people, but to understand *why* they aren't working well together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:20:00">[35:20:00]</a>.

## Leadership Philosophy and Personal Well-being

### Balancing Intensity and Longevity
Georgia acknowledges that in her 20s, she "churned," working long hours and burning herself out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>. Now in her 30s, she is less willing to do that, recognizing the importance of [[balancing_personal_intensity_and_maintaining_longevity_in_leadership | maintaining longevity]]. As a health company, Human Health aims to avoid promoting unhealthy habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>. Georgia believes that if building the company requires sacrificing family, relationships, or health, "it's not worth it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>. She finds her flow state in the evenings and at night, adapting her schedule to what works for her, rather than adhering to a rigid ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.

### Finding Flow and Surrendering Control
Georgia's deep love for product development allows her to enter a "flow state" where she loses track of time, similar to an artist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>. She views product design as an art form that allows her to express herself and help others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03:00">[29:03:00]</a>.

A significant shift in her [[authenticity_in_leadership | leadership]] has been surrendering control over the outcome of Human Health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:03:00">[52:03:00]</a>. By accepting any potential outcome, she finds herself less stressed and more creative, believing that when she is "at peace," the "sky is the limit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:31:00">[53:31:00]</a>.

### Impact and Optimism
Ultimately, Georgia hopes to be remembered for bringing joy to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:11:00">[56:11:00]</a>. She recognizes that if she is not optimistic or joyful in her daily interactions, it's a sign she needs to take a break and recalibrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:51:00">[56:51:00]</a>. This self-awareness allows her to maintain a healthy state and ensure her actions align with her desired impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:22:00">[57:22:00]</a>. Georgia embodies a balanced approach to [[Leadership lessons and company building in the tech industry | company building]], prioritizing personal well-being alongside ambitious goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

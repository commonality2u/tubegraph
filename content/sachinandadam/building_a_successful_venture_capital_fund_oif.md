David Shein, founder of Australia's first unicorn company, Comtech, and author of "The Dumbest Guy at the Table," is also the co-founder of the emergent venture capital fund, OIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Established in 2016 with co-founder Jeff Levy, OIF has grown to manage hundreds of millions of dollars in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.

## Founding and Vision of OIF

Shein's decision to co-found OIF stemmed from a regret he felt about not acting on his early recognition of the internet's potential impact after selling Comtech in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. In 2016, observing the burgeoning innovation in Australia, he told Jeff Levy that they needed to be part of it, not just witness it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.

The timing aligned with the Malcolm Turnbull government's changes to tax policies, which made it more tax-effective for high-net-worth individuals to [[The challenges and rewards of securing venture capital | invest in startups]] and early-stage venture capital funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>. This environment facilitated the establishment of OIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>.

### The "Three Fs" Philosophy

The core thesis of OIF, which Shein hopes will never change, is built upon "Three Fs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>:

1.  **Founder**: OIF is deeply committed to its founders, viewing them as customers. They prioritize adding value beyond just providing capital, which is seen as a commodity in a market with significant funds like Blackbird and Square Peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. This [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | founder-first approach]] aims to do "whatever we can to help a Founder achieve their objectives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.
2.  **Fund**: As a fund, OIF is entrusted with investor capital and is committed to being good stewards, investing wisely to deliver returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. OIF exclusively has high-net-worth individuals as investors, without institutional money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. They prioritize a happy founder and a 5x return over a 7x return that alienates the founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>.
3.  **Fund Without a D**: This refers to the desire to work only with people they genuinely want to work with, fostering mutual respect and positive relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.

## Investment Strategy and Identifying Talent

OIF's investment thematic is **founder-led**, meaning they do not target specific industries but rather seek out exceptional founders, believing that these individuals will lead them to fast-growing industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. For example, while they see climate change as a massive opportunity, they don't yet have investments in that area, but anticipate doing so in future funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

### Founder Qualities and Gut Feel

Shein relies significantly on his "gut" feeling when [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | investing early stage]], as there are no established numbers or proven track records to guide decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. The key is to believe whether a founder can execute their business plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

Key qualities OIF looks for in founders include:
*   **Ability to Energize People**: Founders must be able to convince early team members and customers to join and support their vision, even without established infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.
*   **High Energy**: Founders must possess significant energy to navigate challenges such as pandemics, talent retention issues, and shifts in capital availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **The "Edge"**: The capacity to make tough, decisive "yes or no" decisions, whether it's letting go of a top salesperson who doesn't align with company values, or cutting non-core products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.
*   **Execution Capability**: The belief that the founder can genuinely execute the business plan they have presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

Shein observes that the current generation of founders, having navigated challenging times, will likely be "the best" due to their resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.

## OIF's Success and Future

OIF has achieved significant success, as demonstrated by its rapid fundraising abilities. Recently, they raised $100 million for Fund 3 within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>.

### Memorable Investments

One of OIF's most memorable investments is Instacluster, which epitomizes their [[Key investments and experiences in venture capital | investment strategy]]. OIF initially invested $3.5 million when the company needed $7 million, walking the streets to find other VCs, but all turned them down except By the Door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. Nine months later, OIF was able to invest another $500,000 at the same valuation, and later another $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. This investment alone returned $70 million from a $37 million fund, effectively doubling an initial investment in OIF's fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>. Shein noted that "no one else saw" the potential in Instacluster at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.

The founders of Instacluster have since invested in OIF's Fund 3, highlighting the strong relationships and mutual trust cultivated by OIF's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>.

### Legacy

Shein's desired legacy for OIF is simple: for their founders to love them, and for their investors to feel that trusting their capital to OIF was "the best thing we did" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>. He believes that as long as OIF's founders love them and they continue to deliver amazing returns for investors, "it'll be a fund 26," but they are "only as good as our last fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. This demonstrates OIF's continuous commitment to performance and relationship management in [[Building and managing a venture capital fund | venture capital]].

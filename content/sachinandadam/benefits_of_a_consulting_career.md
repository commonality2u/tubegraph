Upon finishing university, aspiring professionals often consider conventional pathways such as consulting, law, and investment banking to achieve a successful and impactful career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many, including the speakers, ultimately choose [[pathways_into_management_consulting | management consulting]], considering it an excellent decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Diverse Pathways into Consulting

Individuals arrive at consulting through vastly different [[pathways_into_management_consulting | pathways]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, often having to rethink their initial career assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

*   **Sachin's Journey**: Initially obsessed with startups and entrepreneurship, viewing corporates negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. After interning in venture capital and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, he took a consulting internship to satisfy his parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. He fell in love with it after a project helping create VR headsets for rural Australian communities to access internships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Adam's Journey**: Originally drawn to the public sector and international organizations like the UN, fueled by a passion for economics and serving the greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. An internship at the New South Wales Treasury, however, led to disillusionment with the culture, work, and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This sparked a "personal crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, almost leading him to drop out of university and join the army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. To find clarity, he networked extensively, learning from others' careers, and undertook multiple internships in investment banking, corporate finance, startups, and consultancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. These experiences solidified his conviction that consulting was the right path due to "awesome people," "fascinating projects," and alignment with his skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Reasons for Choosing Consulting

Four major [[reasons_for_choosing_a_career_in_consulting | reasons for choosing a career in consulting]] are highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>:

### 1. Exposure to Diverse Industries and Problems
Consulting offers exposure to a wide range of industries, including energy, financial services, government, and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Consultants solve diverse problems for large businesses and governments, ranging from creating fintech apps for banks to working on multi-billion dollar transactions and due diligence for private equity clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This variety makes defining a consultant's job difficult, as they don't do just one thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### 2. The People
Consulting attracts hyper-intelligent and ambitious individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Surrounding oneself with such people is a strong indicator of future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Even as a junior, consultants often have the opportunity to be in rooms with high-power executives, an experience not common in many other jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### 3. Broad Set of Exit Opportunities
Consulting often serves as a [[consulting_as_a_springboard_for_future_opportunities | springboard for future opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. On average, people spend two to three years in consulting before moving on to bigger careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The diverse and challenging nature of the work provides consultants with many options later in their careers, such as:
*   Big tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   Startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>
*   Investing (private equity or venture capital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>
*   Working in industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>

## Challenges of Consulting

While beneficial, it's important to consider the [[challenges_of_working_in_consulting | challenges of working in consulting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### 1. General Skill Set
Working across many different industries, while fascinating for young people, can be a "double-edged sword" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Projects typically alternate every one to three months, which limits the time to develop deep competencies in specific areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### 2. Work-Life Balance
Consulting is not a "nine to five" job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. While some firms may offer a good work-life balance, many consultancies have average working hours of 60, 70, or even 80 hours a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Additionally, extended periods of travel for different projects can make it tiring and difficult to maintain relationships with family and friends or pursue hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Ultimately, understanding these aspects can help individuals with their [[career_decision_making | career decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

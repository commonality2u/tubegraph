The world faces a significant crisis regarding meat consumption, with global demand for meat continuing to increase year over year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:32">[02:16:32]</a>. The current food system cannot meet this growing demand over the next 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:14">[03:14:14]</a>.

Traditional meat production, particularly [[vows_approach_to_cultured_meat_and_its_innovation_in_the_food_industry | factory farming]], is a major contributor to environmental degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

## Greenhouse Gas Emissions
[[social_impact_and_innovation_in_emerging_technologies | Animal agriculture]] is consistently identified as one of the top few industries contributing to CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:46">[02:35:46]</a>.
*   Meat production accounts for nearly 60% of all greenhouse gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:31">[02:47:31]</a>.
*   [[social_impact_and_innovation_in_emerging_technologies | Livestock production]] alone is responsible for approximately 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:39">[02:58:39]</a>. This figure is greater than the combined emissions from cars, planes, and all other forms of transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:03">[03:03:03]</a>.

## Biodiversity Loss and Habitat Destruction
The global food system is the primary driver of biodiversity loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:24">[02:51:24]</a>. Traditional meat production methods also lead to habitat destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Need for Change
Addressing the environmental impact of traditional meat production requires a fundamental shift in what is consumed and how food is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:18">[02:55:18]</a>. This has led to the exploration of alternatives, including [[comparison_between_cultured_meat_and_plantbased_alternatives | plant-based alternatives]] and [[challenges_and_advancements_in_cultured_meat_technology | cultured meat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

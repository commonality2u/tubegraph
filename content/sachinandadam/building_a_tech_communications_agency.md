Jesse Woo has founded Encore, a strategic communications agency dedicated to [[building a media brand | emboldening clients to command their narrative]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This venture marks a shift from her previous role as a partner at Afterwork Ventures, a $2 million community-powered VC fund that invested in pre-seed and seed-stage startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Founding Thesis and Personal Evolution
The decision to launch Encore is rooted in several beliefs, including the future of [[The role of media in tech entrepreneurship | AI-powered services firms]] and the nuances of good branding and PR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Jesse’s personal journey has informed this pivot, as she sought a life filled with joy, abundance, creativity, and ease, where she could work with people she was excited to see and tackle creative problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. She found that writing and communications consistently offered a sense of "flow" where hours passed quickly, and she felt proud of her work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

A key realization has been the impactful and scalable nature of content, allowing one's values, personality, and humor to resonate with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. This personal experience informed her professional direction, leading to the creation of Encore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

### The Toughest Aspect of Being a Founder
Jesse highlights that while she understood the challenges intellectually as an investor, the true importance of mental toughness only became clear when she became a founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Founders face frequent setbacks and overwhelming days, making mental fortitude, the ability to put things into perspective, and relentless pursuit crucial for getting through the early stages and reaching "zero to one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

> "I think the mental fortitude to put things into perspective and to you know say let's draw a line under this day let's get a good night's rest and then tomorrow let's get after it relentlessly... I think that's actually so important in being a founder and getting through that early stages and getting um through that zero to one." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>

She also emphasizes the value of a co-founder for support and navigating emotional challenges, suggesting that the industry often over-indexes on intellectual horsepower rather than resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## Encore's Distinctive Approach to Communications
Encore aims to challenge conventional corporate communications, which Jesse describes as risk-averse, safe, and often relying on "confected corporatese" and buzzwords that lack meaning for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.

### The Power of Polarization
A core belief at Encore is that "your vibe attracts your tribe, but you can't inspire tribalism or loyalty without being polarizing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. If a brand strongly resonates with one group, it will inevitably alienate others. However, since not everyone is in a company's addressable market, this polarization can highlight core values, making loyalists love the brand even more and evangelize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

For challenger brands and startups, the [[challenges_and_strategies_in_tech_content_creation | risk of omission]]—not standing for anything distinctive—is far greater than the risk of taking a stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. Taking risks in messaging creates crucial feedback loops, allowing brands to learn what resonates and iterate, ultimately compounding their learnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. Successful communications campaigns can even become a significant part of paid marketing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.

### Channel Agnosticism and Business Outcomes
Encore's approach is channel-agnostic, focusing on driving business outcomes regardless of whether the platform is mainstream media, social media, or creator-powered new media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. The objective is always: "What is the belief we need to instill in what audience so they take what action and how does that drive a business outcome?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. This means prioritizing metrics aligned with a client's North Star, such as waitlist sign-ups or B2B leads, over mere coverage in prestigious publications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

The agency recognizes the increasing power of direct communication for founders and CEOs on platforms like Twitter, where "people follow people, they don't follow companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.

### Cultural Context in Australia
Encore acknowledges Australia's unique cultural traits, such as championing the "everyman" and liking "downto-Earth and relatable" figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Rather than seeing this as a limitation, Encore aims to tap into these narratives to supercharge a brand and define its tribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.

An example is the campaign for Slice, a "layby for travel" product. By focusing on the founders' humble origins and their aspiration to make travel accessible, the campaign resonated with a tribe that valued travel but often faced financial barriers. Stories about their first customer, who used Slice to take his family of eight to see extended relatives, successfully attracted their target audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.

## The Role of AI in Communications
Jesse sees a significant opportunity to use AI tools to enhance the work of PR and communications professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>. This includes:
*   **Trend Identification & Newsjacking:** Building tools that crawl various publications, social platforms (TikTok, Reddit, Hacker News), and sub-forums to identify emerging keywords and trends in specific subcommunities that tend to go mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Clues:** AI can provide "clues a lot faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>, allowing human taste-makers to analyze why trends are resonating and determine their potential global or local spread.
*   **Fueling Outbound Motion:** Identifying nascent trends enables the agency to proactively suggest relevant campaign ideas to clients, such as creating a "Bumble run club" if running trends are on the rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.

AI is intended to accelerate and deliver "really awesome Epic campaigns" and provide opportunities for newsjacking, not to substitute human work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>.

## Ambition and Principles for the Future
Encore aims to be a "Launchpad for really epic careers," empowering early-career professionals and fostering an environment where their energy and hope become tremendous assets, rather than being "ground out" by traditional corporate structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>.

The agency's ambition is to build a "long lever" – a platform or audience, which brings significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. A core principle is to "make the right people famous," meaning they will be selective about clients, refusing to work with those lacking integrity, engaged in unscrupulous practices, or abusive towards employees or customers, regardless of potential financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>.

The "fulcrum" upon which this lever operates is **truth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. Unlike agencies that might obscure or twist the truth, Encore believes in operating transparently. In an age where truth often comes out through citizen journalism, government inquiries, and social media, trying to hide it is "very fragile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>. Instead, they aim to help clients "clap back" to controversy, using alienation to highlight core values and command the narrative, rather than simply declining to comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.

> "Our lever is that we make the right people famous and then our forrum is that we always tell the truth." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>

This approach allows a "reputation management initiative" to become something "truly baked into the firm" and create lasting change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:45">[01:15:45]</a>.

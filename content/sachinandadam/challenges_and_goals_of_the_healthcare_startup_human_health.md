Human Health is a healthcare startup co-founded by Georgia Vidler, an former Director of Product at Canva, and Kate. The company has successfully raised the largest pre-seed round in Australian history for a female founding team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The app helps users track their treatments and symptoms, providing actionable insights to help them and their care team learn what works for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. On its one-year anniversary, Human Health had already tracked one million health actions by its community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52">[02:52]</a>.

## Driving Mission and Founder Empathy

The founders' personal experiences deeply inform Human Health's mission. Georgia's "why" for starting the company was linked to losing her dad and her family's extensive struggles with serious mental illnesses, including bipolar, schizophrenia, and manic depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Her own challenges with mental health in her late teens and early twenties further built empathy for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. Similarly, co-founder Kate was motivated by her deep experience with the healthcare system due to her two children having autism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.

The company is focused on solving for people who already have chronic diagnoses, with most users tracking more than one condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. This contrasts with the "wellness" end of the spectrum, as people with chronic conditions have higher motivation to input data and find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.

> "We are very much solving for people that already have chronic diagnoses... we're actually seeing most people that are tracking in human have more than one condition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>

## Core Vision: Patient-First Personalized Healthcare

Human Health's ultimate mission is to provide everyone access to [[importance_of_personalized_healthcare_solutions | personalized healthcare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>. This mission is continually revealing itself as more and more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>. A core value of Human Health is to "fix systems not symptoms," aiming to get to the root cause of health challenges rather than just treating symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

The goal is to build a truly patient-first product, which is rare in the U.S. healthcare system where incentives are often misaligned with the patient's best interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. Many companies build for payers, employers, or pharmaceutical companies, with the patient as a secondary customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>.

### Future of Healthcare

Georgia envisions a future where:
*   Patients have full control of their health information at the click of a button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>.
*   More can be done at home, with super cheap and accessible home testing, uploading data to apps like Human Health for personalized insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:43:34]</a>.
*   Doctors become more like coaches, relying on AI to process information and data, allowing them to focus on human skills like creativity, empathy, and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:36">[00:42:36]</a>.
*   Healthcare becomes an enjoyable experience, unlike the current frustration many feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. This technologically achievable Utopia could be realized in the next 10-20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_execution_and_marketing | Challenges and Strategies]]

Human Health faces several [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_culture | challenges]] in its [[startup_journey_and_success_of_human_health | startup journey]]:

### Complexity of Simplifying Health Data
It is incredibly difficult to make something inherently complex, like health data, simple for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>. Human Health aims to be inclusive of the entire human experience, not just specific conditions, which adds significant complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.

### Resistance to Patient-Centric Model
In the U.S. market, a patient-centric model is generally rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. There is resistance from those who don't see the "huge gaping hole" in the existing healthcare ecosystem, sometimes due to incentives that keep the current system alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.

### Go-to-Market and Monetization
Consumer health apps historically struggle with go-to-market strategies and convincing people to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

Human Health's strategy, inspired by Canva's bottom-up approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>, is to:
1.  Build an amazing free product to achieve scale and create a huge community of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.
2.  Develop an even more amazing paid version that users can optionally upgrade to, based on perceived value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.
3.  In the longer term, follow the path of companies like Headspace and Calm, which monetized their user base and then sought reimbursement from payers, employers, and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. The initial focus for reimbursement will likely be tech employers with progressive health plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

### Safety Concerns with [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_aidriven_startups | AI-Driven Startups]]
As an [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_aidriven_startups | AI-driven startup]] in healthcare, a primary concern is adherence to the medical principle: "first, do no harm." The company prioritizes providing helpful information that guides users without causing any harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.

## Key Milestones and Future Roadmap

Looking ahead, Human Health aims for:
*   **Mass Adoption**: Build a large and engaged community in the U.S. (current focus), then expand to Australia, New Zealand, and Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: Launch paid tools and extra value for users to optionally upgrade to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.
*   **Research**: Launch research flows next year, allowing users to optionally contribute their de-identified aggregate data to medical research via consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>. This mass-scale observational study, approved by an IRB in the US, aims to publish novel findings that contribute to science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>.

Early user feedback has been positive, with one user noting that the app was "so helpful" and "validating" for their experience struggling with bipolar disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.

## Leadership and Team Motivation

Georgia believes that a key to motivating teams around a big mission is to treat projects like brands â€“ with a cool name, logo, slogan, and three top priorities. This helps foster a sense of identity and belonging, making people want to be part of something that matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

Working with her co-founder Kate has been a "magical" and "crazy experience," characterized by a "yin and yang" energy and complimentary skills. While Georgia describes herself as the "dreamer" who "causes chaos," Kate is the "structured one" who "cleans it up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. They share a deeply aligned vision for Human Health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

> "We can't be called human health and then be like, oh by the way, you're going to have to kill yourself to actually make this product. Like if we have to, if and you know Kate and I talk about this a lot, if we had to kill ourselves, sacrifice our family, sacrifice our relationship, sacrifice our health to make this succeed, it's not worth it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>

Georgia emphasizes that while hard work and obsession can be beneficial for founders, it's crucial to find a balance and avoid burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. She reflects on her own experiences of working intensely in her 20s and now prioritizes well-being, taking breaks and accepting potential outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.

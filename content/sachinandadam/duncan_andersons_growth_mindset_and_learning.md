From: [[sachinandadam]] <br/> 

Duncan Anderson is described as a "hyper learner" with a "crazy [[Personal growth and self-awareness | growth mindset]]" who is constantly learning about himself and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. His approach involves deliberately thinking about his career and what he is building globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. He believes in continually upgrading his mind, viewing it as his ultimate creation and possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Evolution of a Learner

Duncan's initial motivation for learning during school was to achieve good grades, secure a better-paying job, and ultimately become rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. However, his love for learning truly began in his first job at [[Duncan Andersons career journey from finance to edtech | Goldman Sachs]], where the content he was learning about financial markets became genuinely interesting, moving beyond just a means to get good grades or promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

> "The first time I discovered the love of learning was in my first job and thank God I discovered the love of learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>

This shift transformed his view of the world from boring obligation to an exciting pursuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. He emphasizes that "studying was draining whereas learning is energizing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Philosophy of Growth and Learning

Duncan believes that everyone should "upgrade themselves consistently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. His approach to learning is driven by curiosity, where one interest naturally leads to another, creating a branching path of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

> "My advice would be just whatever you're interested in type on that string and that string normally leads to something else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>

He maintains that the world can be both interesting and rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>. The more one learns about something, the more interesting it becomes, and the better one becomes at something, the more rewarding it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

### Core Activities for Mental Growth
Duncan outlines five key activities for continually growing one's mind:
*   Reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>
*   Thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>
*   Talking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>
*   Writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>
*   Building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>

He compares this dedication to "going to the gym for your mind sometimes a week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>.

### Mental Models
A significant aspect of Duncan's learning philosophy is the use of **mental models** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, which he defines as "anything that is a way to help you approach a problem better than just nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. He learned about them from figures like Charlie Munger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

He highlights several examples of mental models:
*   **Small, Medium, Large:** Categorizing problems by scale to determine effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   **Problem, Solution, How, Execution:** A framework for understanding problem-solving ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Zero-to-One, One-to-Ten, Ten-Plus Innovation:** Categorizing types of innovation based on novelty and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Bloom's Taxonomy:** Remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, creating, used in education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

He emphasizes collecting many models and learning to modify or combine them to generate new insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### Writing as a Tool for Thought
Duncan considers writing to be "high quality thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. He explains that the mind has limited working memory slots (4-7), and when faced with complex problems, writing allows one to externalize and visualize more than these slots, thereby clarifying confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>. He writes "about anything and everything pretty much all day every day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>.

## Application in Education through Edrolo

As co-founder of Edrolo, an edtech startup, Duncan's [[Entrepreneurial journey and mindset | entrepreneurial journey]] is deeply intertwined with his [[Learning and career development in startup environments | learning and career development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The mission of Edrolo is to improve education by providing resources to secondary schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

His core belief for Edrolo's purpose is "to get minds to the point where they can build themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. He aims to foster a "love of learning" by making curriculums interesting rather than boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

> "Our strategy now was zero percent of the strategy when we started so I think we didn't do some large pivot it's just that over time we learned more and more about the education market and certain things became obvious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>

Edrolo's strategy has evolved from a tutoring marketplace to focusing on creating core textbook-like resources, aiming to influence the majority of a student's learning time in the classroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. He believes that "a good novel... literally makes someone a billionaire or a book on wizards that nobody... reads. It's not that wizards are awesome and not wizards are not awesome, that math is boring and not math is interesting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. This highlights his view that any subject can be made engaging.

Edrolo focuses heavily on content quality and making resources "easy to understand, interesting, and relevant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. They prioritize making "innovation ability" a second-order intended benefit of learning, rather than rote memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. This means systematically varying question structures to prevent rote learning and encourage genuine problem-solving and modification of learned rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>.

### Combating the "Useless Class"
Duncan sees education as a crucial factor in the "race against the machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. With automation replacing repetitive jobs, he emphasizes the need for humans to be able to "upgrade themselves or do non-repetitive jobs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. He aims to significantly increase the proportion of people who can "upgrade themselves" from about one-third to ninety percent, as suggested by Jo Boaler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Future Vision

Duncan's personal vision has shifted dramatically from wanting to retire early to desiring to work until the day he dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. He now views work as potentially "interesting and good for the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>, finding retirement to be "boredom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>. He believes a meaningful life can be achieved by trying to make the world better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] "I definitely want to work till the day I die, I just want to do it in a sustainable fashion." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>

While his journey with Edrolo has been rewarding and interesting, it has also been "extraordinarily stressful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>. He hopes to learn how to achieve better work-life balance and reduce stress while continuing to contribute to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. His approach to personal and professional challenges reflects a continuous commitment to [[Self-improvement selftalk and personal development | self-improvement]] and [[Changing beliefs and personal growth | changing beliefs and personal growth]] over time.

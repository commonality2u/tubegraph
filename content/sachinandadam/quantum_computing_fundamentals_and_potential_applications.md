Quantum computing leverages the behaviour of the world at the smallest length scales, at the level of atoms where quantum states exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This allows for a completely different method of computing compared to classical methods, providing an exponential speed-up for certain tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Not all tasks are better performed on a quantum computer; it excels in specific areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

## Leading the Field: Michelle Simmons

Michelle Simmons is a leading Australian Quantum physicist, recognized for her foundational contributions to atomic electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. A former Australian of the Year, she founded Silicon Quantum Computing, a company that has raised over $100 million to build a quantum computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Her drive stems from tackling challenging technological problems and understanding the fundamental basis of how the world works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. She believes there's a fundamental basis to how the world operates, and by building tools to understand it, humanity can better comprehend and improve the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Quantum computing holds significant promise across various sectors:

*   **Cryptography** The long-term goal of quantum computing is in cryptography, specifically in breaking codes, which was the initial impetus for the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>.
*   **[[Artificial Intelligence and existential risks | AI]] and Quantum Machine Learning** This area is experiencing rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. Quantum states can provide more accurate answers in machine learning, impacting every industry from visual and speech pattern recognition to telecom frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Quantum computing can make data sets feeding into large language models (LLMs) more accurate and nuanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>.
*   **Quantum Simulation** This involves understanding the world at the atomic scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. Applications include:
    *   Developing new materials, such as battery materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.

    *   Drug design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>.
*   **Optimization Problems** Quantum computing can optimize complex logistical challenges, such as freight transportation, aircraft stacking (balancing hundreds of bags while maintaining weight balance), and potentially weather forecasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.
*   **Industry Impact** The technology is predicted to impact nearly every industry sector, including telecom, banking, defense, medical, and agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

## [[challenges_in_developing_and_scaling_quantum_computers | Challenges and Bottlenecks]]

A common misconception is that there are significant delays in quantum computing development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Michelle Simmons clarifies that this perception often arises from companies over-promising on delivery timelines, rather than inherent delays in the technology itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.

The fundamental challenge remains the gap between algorithms and hardware capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. Key technical hurdles include:

*   **Hardware Quality and Reproducibility:** Quantum hardware must be of extremely high quality and reproducible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>. Many technologies struggle to manufacture at scale with consistent quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Control:** Controlling the manufacturing process is crucial for success. Companies that outsource manufacturing or undervalue it may face difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>. Elon Musk's analogy, "building the machine is hard, but building the machine that builds the machines is 10 times harder," applies here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>. Silicon Quantum Computing has built its entire operation around controlling the manufacturing base, aiming for high yield and accurate reproducibility to control the technology's evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.

### Strategic Approaches

Different quantum companies employ varied strategic approaches. Michelle Simmons believes the long-term winner will be a technology that is manufacturable in a high-quality material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>. Some platforms achieve high quality but lack manufacturing capability, while others are easy to manufacture but lack quality. Silicon Quantum Computing aims to combine the best of both worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. For example, cold atom systems (like QuEra in the US) can create very high-quality qubits, but their manufacturing scalability is a key question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>. Superconducting technologies, while easier to manufacture (using 1990s technology), often have larger chips and lower quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.

### Geopolitical Implications

There is an expectation of intense geopolitical rivalry in quantum computing, leading to a "Quantum Supremacy" (now often called "Quantum Advantage" or "Quantum Utility") race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>. Controlling manufacturing is critical because it allows a country to retain the best of the technology and control its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. This highlights the importance of sovereign capability in manufacturing for nations like [[australias_path_to_becoming_a_tech_superpower | Australia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>. While any technology can be used for nefarious purposes, Australia's position at the forefront puts it in control of its technological future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>.

## Misconceptions about Quantum

A common misconception is that quantum mechanics is inherently difficult and incomprehensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. Michelle Simmons argues that it involves a relatively simple level of mathematics, primarily linear algebra, and is a well-understood, practical, and mathematically precise field, not a vague or theoretical one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.

Another cultural misconception, particularly in Australia, is the belief that the country cannot be at the forefront of such technology due to its remote location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>. However, with technologies being put on the cloud, physical location becomes less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. Australia is well-positioned for high-quality, "Swiss watch-style" manufacturing due to its ability to produce highly valuable, smaller quantities of products accessible globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.
Australians often feel the need for validation from other countries, like the US or UK, before committing to big technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. Instead, Australia should focus on and leverage its unique approaches to developing technologies, which other countries might not adopt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>. This unique approach is evident in how Silicon Quantum Computing secured investment from government, banks, telcos, and universities, a model different from the pure venture capital approach seen elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.

This cultural hesitancy also manifests in making educational courses easier, rather than challenging young people with difficult goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>. Raising expectations and encouraging young people to take on significant challenges, including the experience of failure and building resilience, is crucial for fostering innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

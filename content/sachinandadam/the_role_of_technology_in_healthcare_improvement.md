The co-founders of [[challenges_and_goals_of_the_healthcare_startup_human_health | Human Health]], Georgia Vlahos and Kate Lamberis, embarked on their venture after personally experiencing [[challenges_in_navigating_the_healthcare_system | challenges navigating the healthcare system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. They recognized a widespread issue in healthcare, characterized by misdiagnosis, slow medical systems, and a lack of new [[role_of_technology_in_healthcare_accessibility | technology and innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Addressing Gaps in Healthcare

[[challenges_and_goals_of_the_healthcare_startup_human_health | Human Health]] was founded to tackle these systemic problems, aiming to improve the health industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The resonance of this problem was evident in their successful fundraising efforts, securing Australia's largest pre-seed round for an all-female founder team at A$10.15 million in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Investors saw a "huge gaping hole" in the healthcare ecosystem that [[challenges_and_goals_of the_healthcare_startup_human_health | Human Health]] aims to fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### The Product: Human Health App

[[challenges_and_goals_of_the_healthcare_startup_human_health | Human Health]] (now Human Health) offers a digital tool for patients and caregivers to manage their health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. It allows users to:
*   Track symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>
*   Monitor treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>
*   Learn what treatments are effective for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>
*   Share this information with healthcare providers to advocate for their care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>

The tool primarily serves individuals with one or more chronic diagnoses, with many users tracking multiple conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

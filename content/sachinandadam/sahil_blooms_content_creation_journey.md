Sahil Bloom is a well-known content creator and investor, recognized for his Twitter threads, Substack newsletter, and podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. He experienced a "meteoric rise" in 2020 and 2021, becoming a widely recognized name in the business world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Origins of Content Creation
Sahil began creating content in early 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This shift occurred because the COVID-19 pandemic provided him with more free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Prior to this, he had spent six years working in the private equity world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

His background in investing taught him valuable skills, such as storytelling and how to identify and learn ideas, taking abstract information and presenting it in a concise and clear manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.

## Rapid Growth and Impact
Sahil's presence "blew up" on Twitter and LinkedIn shortly after he started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. By early 2022, he was a household name across the tech and business landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. He expresses constant amazement that he can reach so many people and that they find value in his writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.

He takes his content creation very seriously, carefully considering what he puts out and feeling a strong sense of responsibility for his platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. He aims to impact the vast majority of people positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.

One area where his content has had a significant impact is through pieces he wrote on cold emailing and the job recruiting process. He received heartwarming feedback from people who used his information to land their dream jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:31">[00:48:31]</a>.

## Content and Investment Synergy
Sahil's public presence on social media has become a valuable asset in his investing career. He notes that having a distribution platform like his helps with deal flow, allowing him to gain access to good investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. He can help founders gain visibility for their projects and amplify their narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

## Navigating the Challenges of Public Presence
Sahil acknowledges that while social media often presents a curated, "best version" of oneself, he feels it's his duty to share the reality of his journey, including stumbles and bad moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Mediating Ego
Sahil employs several mechanisms to keep his ego in check:
*   **Family:** His wife keeps him grounded, caring more about his presence and relationship than his follower count or revenue streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. His parents also play a role, with his mother critiquing his podcast appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>, and his father only recently subscribing to his newsletter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.
*   **Long-term friends:** His closest friends, whom he has known since age three, do not care about his social media followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.
*   **"Haters":** He views negative comments as a good thing, helping to keep his head on straight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>. He believes it's liberating to realize that even admired figures are not fundamentally different or "special in some amazing way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

## Sahil's Podcast: Where It Happens
Sahil co-hosts a podcast called "Where It Happens" with Greg Eisenberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. He once told Dave Friedberg, a guest on the podcast, that he felt he "owed him money" after learning so much from their conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. This highlights his appreciation for learning from others.

## Favorite Creator
Sahil's favorite creator is Tim Urban, the author of "Wait But Why," whom he considers one of the best writers in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>.

## Broader Industry Shifts
Sahil observes that the venture landscape is forming a "barbell" structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. On one end are large, established venture capital firms like Benchmark, Sequoia, Andreessen, and Tiger, which offer significant cachet to founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. On the other end are individuals like himself, Packy McCormick, and Julian Shapiro, who have raised funds and offer a specific, high-ROI value-add to companies for a smaller amount of dilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. He believes that the mid-tier VCs are "getting squished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>. This represents a significant shift in the nature of [[challenges_and_strategies_in_tech_content_creation | angel investing]] and early-stage venture capital due to individuals rapidly [[building_a_media_brand | building profiles]] and distribution channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

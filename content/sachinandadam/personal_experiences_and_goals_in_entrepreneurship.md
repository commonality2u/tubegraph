The [[the_journey_and_mindset_of_being_a_visionary_and_an_entrepreneur | entrepreneurial journey]] is deeply shaped by personal experiences, leading to significant shifts in mindset and the formulation of long-term goals. This article explores the evolving perspectives of Max Martian, Sachin, and Adam on their [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_mindset | entrepreneurial journeys]], personal growth, and philosophies regarding life and creation.

## Max Martian: From Exploration to Focused Vision

Max Martian, a founder currently operating in stealth, previously founded the investment syndicates Ultraviolet and Next Chapter, and held internships, notably with Goldman Sachs, after studying finance at university [00:02:29]. His path exemplifies a profound shift in personal and professional objectives.

### The Shift to Hundred-Year Goals
Max's "most profound belief shift" came during five months in San Francisco, leading him to ask: "What are the Hundred Year goals I could set myself?" [00:03:46]. He narrowed these ambitious goals to two:
1.  **Creating a new city** [00:04:11]
2.  **Rebuilding healthcare** [00:04:14]

The healthcare goal holds personal significance due to a 10-year period of misdiagnosis and surgery that led him to become a "huge Health geek" [00:04:20]. He sought to work on "something that actually matters" [00:04:38]. Max believes cities are not optimized for quality of life, mental health, human connection, or innovation, leading to his interest in redesigning urban spaces based on principles seen in nature and historical architecture [00:06:22].

Max has moved from an "explore mode" to a "Double Down, burn the boats mode," focusing on the healthcare track [00:11:53]. He aims to apply ratios seen in nature, like the golden ratio, to design, which he feels modern architecture often ignores [00:08:15].

### Mana Over Matter: A San Francisco Insight
Living in San Francisco taught Max the importance of "Mata versus Mana" â€” what someone says versus how they say it [00:04:52]. He observed a cultural difference where San Francisco conversations involve pausing to think deeply before responding with concise, meaningful words, contrasting with an Australian tendency to respond quickly and sound smart [00:05:09]. This led him to focus on the actual content of what people say rather than just their articulation [00:05:28].

### The Founder's Mindset
Through meeting founders of unicorn companies in San Francisco, Max realized they are "no different to you and me" [00:05:44]. They are simply individuals who:
*   Took risks [00:05:47]
*   Had a contrarian view of the future [00:05:48]
*   Tried to fix world problems [00:05:53]

Max also reflected on a previous "mimetic" phase, where he inherited desires from others and defined "good" based on external perceptions rather than intrinsic values [00:11:58].

### Life as a Founder
Max's daily life as a founder revolves around identifying what actions "move the needle" [00:59:10]. He tracks his hours and daily accomplishments, acknowledging that being "busy" does not equate to "getting shit done" [00:59:15]. He maintains a rigorous schedule, waking up at 8 AM and working until midnight or 1 AM, including daily 20-minute exercise sessions [00:59:36].

He highly dislikes "dogma" in the startup world, such as the debate around building in stealth mode [01:01:14]. For him, building in stealth allows for:
1.  Better control of the narrative [01:01:35]
2.  More frequent pivots without narrative changes [01:01:37]
3.  Mitigation of competitive risk [01:01:41]

Max believes in thinking in "10 or 20 year intervals" rather than 10-month intervals, as longer timeframes are driven by "opinion" and what can be created, whereas shorter ones are largely market-driven [01:05:04]. He views his current work as aligned with things he "always wanted to do" but was "penalized for" in the past, such as working his own way [00:58:37].

He constantly refines a list of hypotheses to validate, prioritizing the most important ones he is best suited to confirm quickly [01:03:05]. Max contrasts his approach with the "Lean Startup methodology," stating he knows "exactly what 10 years or 20 years or 30 years should look like," and focuses on the right path to get there [01:04:08].

As a leader, Max has learned to better communicate his decision-making process, as he tends to process many variables quickly and state conclusions without articulating the steps [01:07:38]. He also deliberately introspects on maximizing his energy and performance throughout the day, recognizing the impact of waking up during deep sleep [01:09:28].

## Sachin: Intentionality and Empathy in Venture Capital

Sachin's personal journey has seen a transition from an "explorative mode" to one of "intentionality and clarity" [01:12:52]. This shift was catalyzed by significant life changes, including a breakup, moving, and starting a strategy consulting role [01:12:38].

### The Power of Reflection and Intentionality
Sachin's experiences led him to realize he was "stretched really thin" and adopting "unauthentic" habits [01:13:05]. A "think week" in Bali facilitated deep reflection, allowing him to understand his values and identify misalignments in his life [01:13:50]. This period of "ground up" thinking resulted in a desire for:
1.  **Clarity**: Understanding what he wants out of life, focusing on 2-3 core things [01:14:40].
2.  **Intentionality**: Thoughtfully considering actions [01:14:55].

Tactical changes include reducing alcohol consumption in favor of activities that "fill his cup," such as running in nature with friends [01:15:15], and dedicating quiet time for reflection and reading [01:15:53]. He suggests quarterly retreats or regular reflective time to identify alignment between behaviors and values [01:16:42].

### Intuition, Data, and Greenlights
Sachin's reading of "Greenlights" by Matthew McConaughey highlighted the importance of intuition, contrasting it with the analytical approach often found in business autobiographies [01:18:21]. He questions whether his own intuition is intrinsic or biased by external influences, suggesting it's a mix of "social conditioning" and deeper, perhaps spiritual, insights [01:19:30].

Max adds that intuition is "access to experiences stored in our subconscious" [01:20:44]. Good judgment, or intuition, comes from:
*   Having many experiences ("distance") [01:20:59]
*   High storage of those experiences ("storage") [01:21:03]
*   High "Ram" to hold multiple elements simultaneously for decision-making [01:21:24]
Max quotes, "intuition brings you to a mountain, data helps you climb it" [01:21:43].

### Journey into Venture Capital
Sachin joined AirTree, a large Australian VC firm, through an unconventional path [01:10:03]. He found the role similar to podcasting, where "the quality of your questions" is key [01:10:29]. He values the opportunity to converse with interesting founders and question their thinking [01:10:41].

Initially skeptical, he now appreciates the "analytical side" of venture capital, particularly financial modeling, as it forces a deeper understanding of "the drivers of a business" [01:11:00]. Sachin believes top VCs in the coming decades will have a "vigorous Bill Gurley style training" [01:11:43].

A pivotal [[impact_of_personal_experiences_on_entrepreneurship | personal experience]] for Sachin was helping his father start a disability tech startup for two to three years, including fundraising and pitching to VCs [01:16:40]. This period, where his family experienced financial hardship, instilled deep "empathy" for founders and the challenges they face [01:17:10]. He emphasizes that this empathy is crucial for a VC, stating he wouldn't be comfortable in his role without it [01:17:17].

Regarding giving [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_advice | advice on entrepreneurship and startup success]], Sachin aligns with Tim Doyle, suggesting that VC associates should not give advice out of insecurity [01:12:27]. Instead, they should offer "feedback" based on pattern matching and fund theses, with a "lower ego" [01:12:46]. He advocates for being "blunt but also being like low ego" [01:16:16], acknowledging the value of a founder's extensive experience over a VC's limited interaction [01:20:26].

Sachin strives to be a "great investor over decades" [01:20:52]. His focus areas include:
*   **Top of funnel**: Building a strong personal brand (e.g., through podcasting) to attract good companies, rather than relying solely on outbound efforts [01:21:12].
*   **Domain expertise**: Incrementally improving knowledge in areas like Biotech, Health, Consumer, and Climate to ask good questions and develop strong theses [01:21:51].
*   **Decision-making**: Doing "the reps" and learning from smart people to make better investment decisions, especially valuing rigorous analytical skills in the current market [01:22:09].

## Adam: The Drive to Create and Share

Adam's perspective on personal growth centers on the desire "to create than consume" [02:27:03]. He believes "everyone has something to share with the world" [02:27:12] and should lean into their creative side.

### The Urge to Create
Adam is fascinated by individuals who combine "left and right brain thinking," like Leonardo da Vinci, who excelled as both an artist and a scientist [02:27:30]. This fascination fuels his own goal to "publish a lot more content" and "put [his] views out there" [02:27:50].

He views creating as crucial for the "soul" and as a way to challenge overconsumption [02:28:12]. While creating a company is an "upper tier" of creation, other forms include podcasting, writing, and creating events or experiences [02:28:57]. He envisions leaning towards company building later in his life, acknowledging past imposter syndrome from his father's challenging startup journey [02:29:13].

Adam holds founders in "ultimate status" due to their risk-taking and novelty in the world [02:29:58]. He believes everyone should engage in creation, not just artists [02:30:25]. Creation is an "expression of humanity" and authenticity [02:31:50], something that is "beaten out of people" by systems that prioritize conformity over risk-taking [02:31:55].

He dismisses the notion that widespread creation lowers content quality, arguing that "Darwinism" will naturally filter out less valuable contributions [02:33:55]. He emphasizes that creation doesn't always need to be public; it can be a personal, quiet process of "turning yourself inside out" and expressing what is unique to oneself [02:34:00].

### Identifying Accelerators
Adam, Sachin, and Max discuss identifying "accelerators" â€“ individuals with steep growth curves, not just those with "distance" (much accomplished) [00:36:15]. Key traits for accelerators are "curiosity and drive" [00:37:52].

Adam highlights three elements for students to accelerate their growth:
1.  **Velocity**: Acting quickly, engaging in rapid feedback loops, and taking action (e.g., coffee meetings, reading, starting projects) [02:53:02].
2.  **Boldness**: Taking risks and making courageous choices, such as reaching out to successful individuals or publishing ideas publicly [02:53:06].
3.  **Reflection**: Engaging in independent thinking by truthfully assessing oneself, leading to authenticity rather than copying others' ideas [02:53:27].

Max's personal accelerant was "realizing that being myself is a superpower" [02:56:51], leading him to express his authentic beliefs and personality, even if it polarizes others [02:57:13]. Adam agrees, noting that authenticity makes everything easier and allows one's magical qualities to add value [02:57:50].

Fred Schebesta, founder of Finder and author of "Go Live," is described as a "true visionary" who can "feel trends before they happen" [00:00:27]. His unique perspective extends to the cosmos, where he sees immense potential and impact for humanity's future.

## Space: The Ultimate Frontier
Schebesta views [[space | space]] as the ultimate frontier, believing that humanity has yet to fully grasp its knowledge [00:17:27]. He contends that there's "so much to discover and learn about ourselves and about our planet" through space exploration [00:17:41]. Expanding into space will profoundly change humanity, enhancing our survivability and our management of our "organic state" [00:17:54]. Historically, a shift in perspective, like realizing the Earth revolves around the Sun, has drastically altered human understanding [00:18:39]. Similarly, successful ventures into [[space | space]] and to other planets will lead to new systems and ideas, fundamentally improving our perception of reality [00:18:56].

Just as experiencing electric cars makes loud combustion engines seem jarring, living on a harsh planet like Mars could make humans appreciate Earth's balanced environment and the consequences of pollution [00:19:17]. This change in perspective is a key reason Schebesta would dedicate significant resources to advancing humanity into [[space | space]] [00:20:56].

## Humanity as a "Virus" and the Drive for Growth
Schebesta posits a thought-provoking thesis: humanity is fundamentally a "virus" [00:22:21]. This is because humans are the only species on Earth that threatens to kill the entire planet, unlike other creatures that live in harmony and balance with it [00:22:44]. Humans possess an "undeniable desire for growth" that mirrors a virus â€“ we spread, consume, and move [00:23:43]. This inherent drive, born from humanity's evolution from the lower ranks of the food chain to the top, has led to a continuous feeling of dissatisfaction, pushing us to constantly seek more [00:24:43].

> "Going to [[space | space]] is... more [[space | space]], it's more resources so that we can come to terms with our evolutionary... challenge of... a continuous dissatisfaction with our state of humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>

For Schebesta, expanding into [[space | space]] is a "hedge" to ensure the survival of humanity [00:26:02], providing the necessary room and resources to address our evolutionary drive for growth.

## Investment in Space and Future Industries
Schebesta is so committed to [[space | space]] that if given $100 billion to spend in 10 days, he would buy SpaceX [00:17:17]. This sentiment is shared by others, with some investors actively acquiring private shares in SpaceX [00:21:07]. The potential of [[the_new_space_race_and_global_satellite_boom | Starlink]] is particularly highlighted for its ability to provide global internet access, potentially leading to a greater [[social_impact_and_innovation_in_emerging_technologies | quality of opportunity]] for people in developing nations by making internet widely available and eventually more affordable [00:21:26].

Schebesta is broadly optimistic about [[the_impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | the future of technology and AI]]. He believes that the rapid acceleration towards the [[the_impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | metaverse]], sped up by the COVID-19 pandemic, will fundamentally change things [00:26:39]. The ability for people to earn more money in virtual games than in the real world signifies a major shift [00:26:55]. This could lead to a better distribution of wealth and income in many societies [00:27:55].

Looking ahead, Schebesta [[predicting_future_trends_in_society_space_art_and_technology | predicts]] that as [[the_impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | AI]] and robots become more prevalent, leading to universal basic income, society will experience a "renaissance" in art and culture [00:29:10]. As automated tasks free up human time and people become bored, entertainment will flourish, making actors some of the wealthiest individuals in society within 25 years [00:29:57]. He also foresees environmentalism becoming a premium, leading to more jobs focused on protecting nature, particularly pristine, untouched environments like those found in Australia [00:31:45]. This untouched wilderness, being increasingly rare, could become a highly valuable asset [00:32:36].

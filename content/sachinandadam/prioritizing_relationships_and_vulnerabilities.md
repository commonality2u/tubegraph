Sahil Bloom, a renowned content creator, investor, and entrepreneur, emphasizes the paramount importance of relationships and vulnerability in both personal life and career success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His meteoric rise in 2020-2021 saw him become a well-known figure in the business world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## At the Core: A People Person

At his core, Sahil identifies as a "people person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. His life has always been driven by [[building_and_nurturing_personal_and_professional_relationships | relationships]] with family, friends, and broader networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. He gains energy from being around people, hearing their stories, and interacting with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This innate desire to help people and create value for those around him permeates everything he does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

### Influence of Background and Upbringing

Sahil's mixed-race background, with an Indian mother and a Jewish father, exposed him to diverse perspectives from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. His father's estrangement from his family due to his marriage led to a deep connection to Sahil's Indian heritage and extensive travel, providing a "microcosm of Humans of New York" experience globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. This exposure taught him that regardless of background, people share similar motivations: wanting to care for their families, be happy, and smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

His parents instilled profound beliefs:
*   **Hard Work and Grit:** From his academic father, Sahil learned a "head down, grind things out" mindset, coupled with the importance of always being present for family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
*   **The Power of Love and Sacrifice:** His father sacrificed everything for his mother, a testament to deep love that continues to inspire Sahil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
*   **Kindness and Storytelling:** His mother, who secretly applied to college in America at 18 with no money, built an amazing life and possesses an "incredible personality" and storytelling ability, traits Sahil believes he inherited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

## Embracing Vulnerability and Overcoming Low Points

Sahil aims to be more vulnerable, a struggle he is actively working on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. He believes it's his duty, especially with a large platform, to show the reality of the journey, including "bad stumbles and bad moments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

He shared two significant low points that profoundly shaped him:
1.  **Post-College Job Rejections:** After graduating from Stanford with multiple degrees and playing baseball, he was rejected from every job he interviewed for, feeling "really lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. This "darkest before the dawn" moment led to someone taking a chance on him for his first job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.
2.  **Career Transition to Venture Capital:** When transitioning from private equity, he sought impressive roles that would "flex" on LinkedIn, but faced rejection again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. This rejection, coupled with having already announced his departure from his prior firm, left him feeling "in this terrible spot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. However, a conversation with a friend provided clarity: he was pursuing a path based on expectation rather than his own energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. This realization led him to a more entrepreneurial path, resulting in his current "amazing things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

>[!tip] The "Darkest Before the Dawn" Principle
>Sahil notes a common thread in his life: "terrible, darker moments" have always preceded "amazing clarity and light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.

## Relationships in Career Success and Investing

[[networking_and_relationships_in_career_success | Relationships]] have been crucial throughout Sahil's career:
*   **Private Equity:** While in private equity, his job became increasingly people-oriented, and his bosses recognized and leveraged his strength as a "people person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>. The relationships built there, including with firm partners, are now major investors in his fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>.
*   **Angel Investing & Venture Capital:** His early angel investing was exclusively through his networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>. He advises new angel investors to be wary of opportunities that come to them too easily if they don't yet have a platform or value-add <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>.
*   **Beyond Financial Returns:** Sahil encourages thinking about returns "more comprehensively than just financial returns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>. He made an early investment he was financially "mixed on" but knew it would provide "broader returns" by getting him "into the room" with influential figures like David Sacks, ultimately leading to significant [[importance_of_mentors_and_networks | networking]] opportunities and partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:58:00">[22:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:00">[23:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>.

## Prioritizing Life's Pillars

Sahil believes life has various "buckets" – job, family, friends, relationships, and health – and it's impossible to optimize all of them at all times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:32:11">[0:32:11]</a>. He suggests:

*   **Shifting Focus:** One must shift what is in focus at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.
*   **Over-communicating Priorities:** It's crucial to "overly communicate" your focus areas to those around you, especially friends and partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>. For instance, early in his career, his focus was on [[prioritization_and_focus_in_business | building the foundation of his career]], and he needed to communicate that to his friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

### Shifting Priorities: A Profound Change

Sahil's priorities shifted dramatically around the time of COVID-19, when he realized the world was changing, his parents were aging, and he and his wife wanted to start a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. He re-evaluated the trade-off of working 90-100 hours a week in his prior role versus having more [[balancing_work_life_and_personal_wellbeing | flexibility and leverage]] in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>.

> "Someone said to me like, you know, you see your parents once a year if they're 60 years old you might see them 20 times before they die and that scared the sh*t out of me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>

This realization led to an "unbelievable clarity" that prompted him and his wife to sell their house in California and move to New York within a month in May 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. This decision, driven by the desire to be closer to his parents and be a present father to his soon-to-be-born child, was the "best decision" he ever made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>.

## Mediating Ego and Staying Grounded

Despite his rapid rise, Sahil has mechanisms to keep his ego in check and remain grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>:
*   **Family:** His wife "doesn't care a damn" about his follower count or revenue streams; she correctly prioritizes his presence and relationship with her and their future child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. His parents also keep him grounded; his mom critiques his podcast appearance, and his dad only recently subscribed to his newsletter, casually remarking "we'll see if it's good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.
*   **Closest Friends:** His lifelong best friends, whom he met at age three, "don't give a sh*t that I have a bunch of followers on Twitter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>. They provide the stable presence of people who have known him throughout his journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.
*   **Haters:** Critical feedback helps keep his head on straight, preventing an overwhelming sense of positivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>.
*   **Humility:** Realizing that admired figures are not fundamentally different or more special than anyone else is a "liberating feeling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>. This humility fuels a constant striving for improvement, which Sahil sees as the very reason to be alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.

## Advice for Young Leaders

For 20-something leaders, Sahil offers the following advice, emphasizing a perspective beyond the "hustle culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>:

*   **Focus on Foundational Skills:** Identify early whether you are a "builder" (e.g., coder) or a "salesman/saleswoman" (someone who can sell ideas, investments, or themselves) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. He believes learning to "sell" is the most valuable skill for most people, allowing one to convince others to take chances on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>.
*   **Cultivate Curiosity:** Be curious about the world and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>.
*   **Develop Deep Relationships:** Spend time with great people and foster deep relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.
*   **Embrace Learning and Growth:** Be in rooms where you are the "dumbest one" to absorb, listen, learn, and ask questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.
*   **Release Pressure:** Do not feel pressured to adhere to arbitrary timelines or external expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:48">[00:51:48]</a>. Life's trajectory cannot be fully planned, and doing things in the moment that compound will eventually take care of themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.

>Sahil emphasizes that at 31, he still strives to improve, a mindset applicable at any age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:34">[00:52:34]</a>. He doesn't consider himself particularly successful, a perspective he maintains by acknowledging there's always someone "smarter, better, faster" in front of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>. This constant striving is the purpose of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.

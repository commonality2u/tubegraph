Abheek Anand, Managing Director at Peak XV (formerly Sequoia Asia), reflects on how his early life experiences in India, marked by resource constraints and a strong emphasis on education, significantly shaped his career drive and entrepreneurial spirit. He believes that tough times can foster creativity and an urge to build a better life, leading to remarkable professional success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:30">[06:36:30]</a>.

## Childhood in India: Education as a Pathway to Mobility

Anand grew up in India during a period when it was a very poor country, and his family had little money, living in a tiny apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:12">[06:04:12]</a>. In this environment, education was the primary, if not sole, means for social mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:28">[06:26:28]</a>. This cultural emphasis instilled a deep understanding that diverging from the educational path could lead to a less exciting life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:24">[06:51:24]</a>.

He highlights that this experience of "resource constraints" and "not having a whole lot" was a significant driver, pushing him to identify and play to his strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:07">[07:05:07]</a>. For Anand, this strength was problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:38">[07:23:38]</a>. Looking back, he sees the lack of material wealth in his childhood as "the biggest gift" from his parents, as it fostered a powerful drive to achieve something meaningful with his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:44">[08:08:44]</a>. This perspective aligns with [[personal_growth_and_resilience_from_childhood_experiences | personal growth and resilience from childhood experiences]].

### The "Immigrant Mentality"

Anand observed a similar phenomenon among successful founders in San Francisco, noting that many were immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:08">[07:35:08]</a>. While not a prerequisite for success, immigrants often bring a unique drive stemming from not having much and seeking to build a better life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:16">[07:52:16]</a>. This "kind of drive is really quite critical across many, many different people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:23">[08:01:23]</a>.

### The Influence of IIT

Anand's education at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) further solidified this drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:32">[08:42:32]</a>. IITs are renowned engineering programs in India, known for their meritocratic selection process based on a massive entrance exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:07">[09:19:07]</a>. This rigorous system ensures that those admitted are selected purely on merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:37">[09:37:37]</a>.

Beyond academic excellence, IIT fostered a "virtuous cycle" where students, being part of a community with successful role models (many leading tech CEOs in the US are IIT alumni), were inspired to "do something meaningful with my life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:07">[09:57:07]</a>. This community was "an incredible privilege" that helped jumpstart his [[learning_and_career_development_in_startup_environments | career trajectory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:16">[10:28:16]</a>.

Despite the intensity of IIT, Anand describes himself as a "lazy" student who skipped classes, excelling only in subjects he liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:18">[11:02:18]</a>. His defining moment was managing the computer networks at school, which fostered a "hacker mindset" and led to significant learning outside the classroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:17">[11:30:17]</a>. This non-traditional approach ultimately provided a "much more well-rounded education," demonstrating how [[life_and_career_adaptability | adaptability]] and diverse experiences can be more valuable than strict academic performance for [[reflections_on_education_and_careers | career decision making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:36">[12:16:36]</a>. He jokingly states that this "choice of being lazy worked out really well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:17">[12:49:17]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Path and Manufacturing Luck

Anand's early life and background contributed to his "healthy disrespect for authority," which he eventually channeled into a positive force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:42">[21:01:42]</a>. This, combined with a desire to control his "own destiny," led him to become a founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:12">[21:12:12]</a>. The decision to "give it all up to start something new" after moving to the US with little money was "completely crazy but... absolutely essential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:10">[21:39:10]</a>. This demonstrates the profound [[impact_of_personal_experiences_on_entrepreneurship | impact of personal experiences on entrepreneurship]].

He firmly believes in "manufacturing luck" by being in environments of high activity and surrounding oneself with smart, motivated people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:15">[14:26:15]</a>. Living in San Francisco, the "epicenter of the startup world," allowed him to meet his co-founder and be in the "flow of information," which he considers critical to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:21">[15:13:21]</a>.

> "I believe in the long-term power of compounding, but compounding becomes much more interesting if you start to take the risk in the early days to change the slope of your trajectory." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:08">[15:58:08]</a>

This proactive approach, rooted in his early experiences and drive, allowed him to shape his career, from co-founding Tactile (acquired by Facebook) to becoming a managing director at a leading venture capital firm.

## Conclusion

Abheek Anand's journey underscores how early life challenges, when coupled with a strong drive for learning and self-improvement, can lay the foundation for an incredibly impactful career. His story is a testament to the power of resilience, curiosity, and strategic positioning in shaping one's professional destiny.

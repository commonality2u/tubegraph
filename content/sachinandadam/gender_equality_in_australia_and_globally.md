Gender equality is identified as a key social and economic issue that impacts everyone, regardless of gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. It is not seen as a zero-sum game where one gender wins and another loses, but rather as a means to create better families, organizations, communities, and economies for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Elizabeth Broderick's Background and Mission

Elizabeth Broderick, a former Sex Discrimination Commissioner in Australia, is a prominent figure in the field of gender equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. She previously worked as a partner at Ashurst and now leads the Male Champions of Change organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Her passion for fairness originated from being an identical twin, where she learned the importance of equal value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. She also observed gender imbalances in her university studies, being one of three girls in a computer science graduating class of 200 in the early 1980s, despite law having closer to 50% women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

Broderick's ideal job was to be the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, a role she coveted and found deeply fulfilling due to its variety and the opportunity to work with people who cared about equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. She has also served as an independent special expert at the UN, focusing on women and girls worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

Broderick defines gender equality as a world where:
*   Men and women are paid equally for work of equal value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.
*   There is no violence against women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.
*   Men can choose to care equally with women for children and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.
*   Women can be equally engaged in paid work as men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>.
*   Gender stereotypes do not limit either men or women, as these stereotypes are seen to imprison both genders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.
*   Lives are lived based on dignity and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.

## [[role_of_men_in_gender_equality|Role of Men in Gender Equality]]

The Male Champions of Change organization was founded on the principle that men are half of the solution to achieving gender equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. This strategy recognizes that while women's collective action has historically delivered many rights, it must be supplemented by the collective action of men, who often hold the levers of power in nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

The initiative started small about eight years ago when Broderick, as Sex Discrimination Commissioner, asked powerful men like the heads of Qantas and Woolworths to use their collective voice, wisdom, and power to drive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. Today, there are 17 Male Champions of Change groups with over 250 members, not just in Australia but globally, including groups in Pakistan, the Philippines, and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

Actions taken by Male Champions of Change to [[addressing_gender_inequality_in_the_workplace|address gender inequality in the workplace]] include:
*   **Demanding gender-balanced panels**: When asked to speak at events, members inquire about the number of women speakers and the gender balance of the audience, refusing to speak at events where women's voices are not heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. This approach aims to create space for women to gain visibility and advance their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   **Embracing "all roles flex"**: Organizations led by Male Champions of Change have adopted a policy where flexibility is a given for all employees, male or female, without needing to be asked for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. This approach allows men more opportunity to spend time with families and be involved in caring roles, challenging existing stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. For example, Telstra moved 25,000 employees to remote work over a weekend, demonstrating the feasibility of flexible arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

Constructive conversations about the [[role_of_men_in_gender_equality|role of men in gender equality]] should begin with men talking to women and listening to their stories about unrealized aspirations, experiences of violence, or lack of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. Men should also discuss their own desires and challenges, as stereotypes can imprison them by dictating roles like "breadwinner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. The goal is a more equal redistribution of power that benefits everyone, not by ripping power off men, but by building economic resilience and preventing poverty, as demonstrated by dual-income households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.

## Global Issues and the [[impact_of_covid19_on_gender_equality|Impact of COVID-19 on Gender Equality]]

Prior to the pandemic, there was a global backlash against human rights, particularly women's and LGBTQI+ rights, often seen as progressive Western values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. This included a pushback on women's reproductive rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.

COVID-19 has had a significant gendered impact globally:
*   **Increased Domestic Violence**: Police in Hubei Province, China, reported a 300% uplift in domestic and family violence during lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>. Globally, 980 million women were already living in or had recently lived in intimate relationships characterized by physical violence before the pandemic, making home the "least safe place on the planet" for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>.
*   **Disproportionate Unpaid Work**: Unpaid work, such as childcare and elder care, disproportionately falls on women worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>. Lockdowns and school closures have exacerbated this burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:33:00">[17:33:00]</a>.
*   **Job Losses**: More women have lost jobs than men due to their higher prevalence in precarious or casual employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>. Women of color, Indigenous women, and other marginalized women face even greater rates of job loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04:00">[18:04:00]</a>.
*   **Threats to Reproductive Rights**: As UN lead reporter, Broderick identified 11 U.S. states that declared abortion a non-essential procedure during the pandemic, disproportionately disadvantaging poor women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[18:23:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Recovery Bias**: Most new projects and jobs in recovery phases are expected to come from "shovel-ready" infrastructure projects, which traditionally disadvantage women due to low female representation in construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>. Jobs are also needed in caring professions like nursing and public health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>.

## [[challenges_faced_by_women_in_nonwestern_countries|Challenges Faced by Women in Non-Western Countries]]

Broderick's work with the UN reveals significant [[challenges_faced_by_women_in_nonwestern_countries|challenges faced by women in non-Western countries]] that highlight the importance of viewing gender equality through a global lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Informal Economy Exploitation**: Women in some countries, often employed in the informal economy as street vendors, lost their income during lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40:00">[20:40:00]</a>. Some who adapted to digital entrepreneurship by selling clothes on Facebook were arrested and jailed for "damaging the morality of the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>.
*   **Male Guardianship and Legal Disparity**: In parts of the Middle East, women require permission from a male guardian to leave their house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>. In certain countries, a woman's testimony in court is valued less than a man's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58:00">[21:58:00]</a>. These issues are built into laws and societal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:00">[22:07:00]</a>.
*   **Rise of Fundamentalist Religions**: The rise of fundamentalist and extreme forms of various religions (e.g., Islam, Catholicism, Pentecostalism) is seen as a leading cause of backlash against women's and LGBTQI+ rights, pushing for traditional gender roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>.

## Australia's Standing in Gender Equality

Compared to other OECD countries, Australia is roughly in the middle in terms of gender equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>. Areas where Australia is more advanced include recognizing domestic violence as a workplace issue, having paid parental leave schemes, higher levels of equality in workplaces, and strong sexual harassment laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>.

However, significant disparities remain:
*   **Leadership Gaps**: Among the top 200 companies, there are more CEOs named Andrew, Peter, or David than there are female CEOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:00">[24:22:00]</a>. The number of women in Parliament is less than 30%, despite women making up 50.8% of the Australian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[24:58:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Role Models**: Young women often look up to male entrepreneurs and leaders because female examples are less visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32:00">[25:32:00]</a>. Broderick emphasizes that "you can't be what you can't see," leading to a lack of female representation in fields like aviation, military, science, and especially technology, where less than 5% of AI coders are women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:00">[25:55:00]</a>.

## Stereotypes, Quotas, and Systemic Change

Some argue that gender disparities are due to inherent inclinations or conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:00">[26:40:00]</a>. Broderick argues that this is primarily due to different conditioning of boys and girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a>. Interestingly, some countries with lower overall gender equality, like Saudi Arabia, have higher numbers of women in engineering and STEM fields, often driven by a sense of purpose to shape a better world rather than just higher salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:18:00">[27:18:00]</a>.

Broderick supports quotas, or "temporary special measures," in situations where other strategies for achieving gender equality are not working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:44:00">[29:44:00]</a>. These are meant to be temporary until a legitimate outcome, such as 50% representation, is achieved, allowing society to "reimagine what normal looks like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59:00">[29:59:00]</a>.

She highlights that most institutions historically "have been invented by men for men" and are largely run by men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:06:00">[31:06:00]</a>. With a majority of university graduates now being female (around 60% in Australia), these organizations are failing to retain women because they were not designed for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>. Therefore, Broderick asserts that if society doesn't intentionally and actively include women, the system will unintentionally exclude them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:57:00">[31:57:00]</a>. Quotas help actively include women, but there also needs to be a fundamental change in organizational structures, systems, and beliefs so that both men and women can thrive equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:16:00">[32:16:00]</a>. Equality of opportunity alone is insufficient when the opportunities presented are based on a male life trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:31:00">[32:31:00]</a>.

Ultimately, gender equality is about respecting personal choice for all individuals, stemming from universal human rights that are based on dignity and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:31:00">[33:31:00]</a>.

## Personal Reflections and Advice

A memorable moment in Broderick's career involved advising military leaders in Belgium on gender issues, while simultaneously receiving a text from her child asking "Mom what's for dinner?" highlighting the intertwining of her impactful professional life with her personal responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:00">[34:55:00]</a>. She considers it a privilege to have worked with the military, community organizations, and parliaments globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:04:00">[36:04:00]</a>.

In her role at the UN, she regularly speaks in the General Assembly room and presents reports to the Human Rights Council in Geneva, detailing human rights violations against women and girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:09:00">[37:09:00]</a>. Navigating global change in the UN, where some nations do not respect human rights, requires finding common ground and always assuming good intent in conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:50:00">[37:50:00]</a>.

Broderick's advice for university students seeking to make an impact:
*   **Be curious and learn**: Understand what's happening in the world and identify your "work to do in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00:00">[40:00:00]</a>.
*   **Find purpose**: Ensure your work gives you purpose and contributes to creating a better world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>.
*   **Reach out**: Connect with people who inspire you, even if you are a junior, and thank them for their positive contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:46:00">[41:46:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace humanity**: Her core advice is "less intellect and more humanity," encouraging human connection and appreciation for others' work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>.

The journey of the internet is often segmented into distinct eras: Web1, Web2, and the emerging Web3. This evolution reflects shifts in technology, user interaction, and ownership paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

## Defining the Eras

### Web1: The Read-Only Internet
Web1, largely present in the early days of the internet, was characterized by open and interoperable protocols such as HTTP for websites, SMTP for email, and FTP for file sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. While useful, it was niche and often required technical expertise to build and host content, making it difficult for the average user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

### Web2: The Interactive & Centralized Internet
Web2 emerged as companies focused on making the internet easier to use, onboarding hundreds of millions, then billions, of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. Major players like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple built user-friendly interfaces over existing open protocols (e.g., Gmail over SMTP, social media over HTTP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. This era brought a "wonderful experience" and became a "huge economic driver for society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

However, Web2 also introduced challenges regarding data ownership and privacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Creators, such as YouTubers or Instagrammers, often find themselves confined to platforms where they have limited control over their audience or monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. For businesses, innovation can be stifled by centralized control, as platforms can change rules, take larger rents, or alter APIs, making it difficult to build on top of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

### Web3: The Decentralized & Owned Internet
[[Decentralization and ownership in Web3 | Web3]] is defined by the emergence of [[decentralization_and_ownership_in_web3 | decentralization]] through blockchain-based technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. This technology transforms private databases into public, open, and interoperable ones, allowing users to own their data and build permissionlessly on top of existing protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. This shift promises benefits like permissionless innovation and data sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.

## The Genesis of Web3 Investment
John Henderson, a General Partner at Airtree, an Australian crypto fund with a $50 million [[realworld_applications_and_use_cases_of_web3 | Web3]] fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>, was an early angel investor in CoinDesk in 2013, which exposed him to the Bitcoin community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. He met Vitalik Buterin in 2014 and was involved in the Ethereum pre-sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.

Airtree's investment strategy for new technologies follows an "S-shape" innovation curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>:
*   **Installation Phase**: A long, flat period where infrastructure is built but little real-world usage occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. For crypto, this lasted from 2008 to 2019, with limited use cases beyond digital gold, illicit activities, and ICOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.
*   **Deployment Phase**: The vertical part of the curve where real-world people begin using the tools as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

The "light bulb moment" for Airtree to invest in Web3 came during [[realworld_applications_and_use_cases_of_web3 | DeFi Summer]] in early 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>. The emergence of protocols like MakerDAO for stablecoin issuance, Compound and Aave for lending, and Yearn Finance for alternative yields, showed a significant influx of people using a new financial ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.

Despite the speculation and "mania" surrounding crypto, John emphasizes that "real things are being built and real usage is occurring," giving confidence for long-term investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>.

## Incentives and [[Realworld applications and use cases of Web3 | Use Cases]] in Web3

### Aligned Economic Incentives
A fundamental difference in Web3 is the concept of tokenization, which economically aligns communities around a desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>. Unlike Web2 platforms where user contributions are not compensated (e.g., Instagrammers receiving nothing for their content) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>, Web3 allows early users to earn or buy tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>. These tokens incentivize users to promote the platform and benefit from its appreciation, directly tying their economic interests to the protocol's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>. Builders also hold tokens, aligning their incentives with the platform's revenue models (e.g., a DeFi protocol like SushiSwap taking a percentage of exchange fees distributed to token holders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>.

### Beyond DeFi and Collectibles
While much of the public attention is on DeFi and NFT collectibles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:00">[29:20:00]</a>, John highlights that the most exciting aspect of [[realworld_applications_and_use_cases_of_web3 | Web3]] and [[decentralization_and_ownership_in_web3 | decentralization]] is its potential to enable "new primitives and new ideas that we actually can't imagine right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:00">[21:29:00]</a>.

A key innovation is [[web3_and_the_future_of_digital_property_rights | digital ownership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>. Previously impossible to own digital goods, NFTs now allow for this, with current applications including art and collectibles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:45:00">[21:45:00]</a>.

Other significant [[realworld_applications_and_use_cases_of_web3 | use cases]] include:
*   **[[The evolution and impact of the NFT gaming industry | Gaming NFTs]]**: In games like Fortnite or Roblox, players spend thousands on in-game items (skins, cloaks, daggers) that become worthless if they stop playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48:00">[29:48:00]</a>. NFTs allow players to truly own these digital assets and potentially take them to other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:08:00">[30:08:00]</a>. Airtree has invested in Immutable, a scaling solution for [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_nft_gaming_industry | gaming NFTs]] on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:26:00">[29:26:00]</a>.
*   **Proof of Participation/Membership**: NFTs can serve as digital proof of action or contribution at a point in time, which could later lead to rewards or access to communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>. An example is the "Monster Owner's Club" by artist Des Lucrece, where early NFT holders gain access to a special community and receive airdrops/rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>. This could apply to charitable use cases or incentivizing positive actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:00">[31:10:00]</a>.
*   **Fairer Financial Systems**: [[Realworld applications and use cases of Web3 | Crypto]] can provide open and uncensorable finance, particularly crucial for people in oppressed regimes facing hyperinflation or strict currency controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:20:00">[25:20:00]</a>. It offers a solution to avoid devaluation of savings and significantly reduce remittance fees (e.g., from 8% down to negligible amounts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:06:00">[26:06:00]</a>. DeFi also democratizes finance by making it accessible to everyone, not just institutional insiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:29:00">[27:29:00]</a>.

## Nuance and Limits of [[Decentralization and ownership in Web3 | Decentralization]]
While [[decentralization_and_ownership_in_web3 | decentralization]] is a core tenet of Web3, it exists on a spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>. John cautions against "decentralization maximalism," which can be problematic, noting that pure libertarian or anarchist outcomes would be a "disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18:00">[23:18:00]</a>.

Centralization still offers significant benefits like speed, performance, and user experience, which are often superior in Web2 applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:38:00">[24:38:00]</a>. Not all of the internet will become decentralized, and many existing Web2 companies will continue to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>.

## Career Paths and Investment Themes
For young professionals, the advice is to "get a seat on a rocket ship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05:00">[35:05:00]</a>. While Web3 is a rapidly growing and innovative sector, it's a sub-segment of the broader technology landscape. Other fast-growing areas exist, such as climate tech, fintech in developing nations, or Web2 companies like Canva or A Cloud Guru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:47:00">[35:47:00]</a>.

Airtree's investment themes, beyond Web3, include:
*   **Climate Tech**: Projects like Climadao, which uses Web3 mechanisms to bridge carbon credits on-chain, effectively retiring millions of tons of carbon dioxide and raising the price of voluntary carbon credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:29:00">[36:29:00]</a>.
*   **[[The evolution and democratization of media | Creator Economy]]**: Supporting tools and systems for creators and companies leveraging the idea of "thousand true fans," such as Linktree, which has expanded beyond a link-in-bio service to enable commerce and compete with platforms like Wix and Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:13:00">[38:13:00]</a>.
*   **Cybersecurity**: Recognizing that as the internet expands, the need for protection grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:56:00">[38:56:00]</a>.

Ultimately, venture capitalists like Airtree view their role not as prognosticators of the future, but as supporters who provide "rocket fuel" to entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:22:00">[40:22:00]</a>. They seek out unique strengths in founding teams, like Ryan from A Cloud Guru who built a massive community around an obscure topic before starting his company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>.

## The [[The evolution of the podcast and audio mediums | Venture Capital]] Landscape
The venture capital landscape is evolving, with firms like Tiger Global demonstrating that speed and price are paramount for entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:00:00">[46:00:00]</a>. Their rapid due diligence and competitive terms have forced other firms to match their pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:21:00">[46:21:00]</a>. While this raises the "table stakes" for VCs, it ultimately benefits founders by providing more options and capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:29:00">[46:29:00]</a>.

Additionally, there's a "barbell" effect emerging, with large firms on one end and individual "solo capitalists" on the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:40:00">[47:40:00]</a>. Solo capitalists, like Harry Stebbings, bring unique value such as large audiences (e.g., 20 million monthly downloads for Harry's podcast) and extensive global networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:22:00">[48:22:00]</a>. However, scaling issues arise as solo capitalists manage more portfolio companies, potentially diluting the "white glove" service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:21:00">[49:21:00]</a>. Firms like Airtree address this by building robust "portfolio services functions" and fostering a network model where founders can learn from each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27:00">[50:27:00]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy
John emphasizes the importance of balancing professional ambition with personal life. He prioritizes daily exercise to manage his mood and blocks out sacred time with his children every morning and evening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:44:00">[51:44:00]</a>. His core advice for future leaders is: "Chase your passion, not validation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:04:00">[56:04:00]</a>.

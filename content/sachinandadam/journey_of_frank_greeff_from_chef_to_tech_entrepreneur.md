Frank Greeff's [[journey_from_employment_to_entrepreneurship | entrepreneurial journey]] is a testament to drive, creative thinking, and remarkable success, culminating in the sale of a $180 million real estate tech company, Realbase, to Domain [00:00:11, 00:01:21].

## Humble Beginnings as a Chef

Greeff's career started unconventionally for a tech founder. At 20 years old, he was three years into a chef apprenticeship, working 60 hours a week, including Saturdays, Sundays, Christmas, and Easter, earning only $32,000 a year [00:00:27, 00:00:30, 00:00:35]. This experience, combined with his family's past financial struggles, significantly influenced his drive [00:28:59]. His parents went bankrupt in South Africa, and his nuclear scientist father picked apples and sharpened knives in New Zealand, while his mother filleted fish [00:29:14, 00:29:20, 00:29:23]. At one point, his family of five lived in a caravan [00:29:45]. This background instilled a strong commercial and monetary focus, fueling his desire to "make it" [00:30:08, 00:30:22].

## Launching Realbase and Early Challenges

Greeff started Realbase at 20 [00:01:40]. The initial business concept involved installing signboards, a "very unsexy job," with a product selling for $230 [00:33:10, 00:32:57]. He saw the significant income potential compared to his chef salary, making the decision primarily based on the "heaps of cash" it could generate [00:33:04, 00:33:26].

In the early stages, Frank faced challenges due to his age, often presenting to clients double his age [00:22:20]. He initially tried to appear older [00:22:34] but quickly realized his youth was an "unfair advantage" [00:22:46]. Clients often saw him as a son or grandchild, leading to a "twinkle in someone's eye" and appreciating his "young energy" [00:22:52, 00:23:06]. This realization led him to focus on continuously acquiring skills and knowledge to add value, regardless of age [00:23:29].

## Entrepreneurial Philosophy and Mindset

Greeff's [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_mindset | entrepreneurial mindset]] is characterized by several key principles:

### Balance vs. Harmony
Greeff acknowledges that consistent balance is a myth in business and life [00:03:06]. He views his life as progressing through "seasons," with inevitable peaks and troughs of energy requirements [00:02:53, 00:03:25]. He warns against the "hustle culture" that advocates for 100% effort at all times, as it leads to burnout [00:03:15, 00:03:32]. Instead, he focuses on maintaining a consistent energy output over the long term and identifying non-negotiables [00:03:44]. He believes in working like "hunters" – sprinting for a bit, then resting, which is especially effective for creative work [00:04:05, 00:04:13]. While he doesn't achieve "balance," he aims for "harmony" across his core life areas: business, family (including friends), and health/fitness [00:03:35, 00:05:01, 00:05:08]. He integrates these elements, such as training with friends or having his son with him during workouts [00:05:15, 00:05:30].

### High Agency and Quick Decision Making
Greeff describes himself as "erratic," "silly," and "passionate with a lot of conviction," but also as a "cowboy" in business who acts quickly [00:07:02, 00:13:56]. He attributes his ability to act quickly to intuition, which he defines as a "collection of experiences that then forms your ability to act really quickly" [00:14:02, 00:14:05].

A significant factor in his success was "The Compound Effect of making decisions quickly over time" [00:15:07, 00:15:10]. He highlights how compressing the time from decision-making to execution leads to a material compound effect over years [00:15:29, 00:15:36]. He observed that many aspiring entrepreneurs spend years planning without going to market [00:15:51, 00:16:11]. Instead, his approach was to start, test, measure, and iterate quickly [00:16:19, 00:20:10].

His initial business plan for Realbase "didn't exist" [00:16:44]. They focused on the worst-case scenario (going back to a job) and continually adapted [00:16:50, 00:16:55]. This fast velocity of action is contrasted with highly intelligent people who "overthink everything" [00:18:22, 00:18:12].

This approach resonates with Jeff Bezos's concept of "one-way" and "two-way" doors, where many decisions are reversible and don't require extensive deliberation [00:18:27]. Greeff's comfort with change was ingrained from his childhood, as his family moved houses 23 times in South Africa and 8 or 9 times after moving to New Zealand and Australia [00:19:09, 00:19:20, 00:19:29].

### Core Values and Mental Models
While he doesn't explicitly list "six core values," Greeff operates by innate beliefs, such as being a "man of my word" [00:25:38, 00:25:48]. He views trust as having a "compound effect on your personal brand" [00:26:05].

He employs a "mental model" he calls the "pathway of least resistance," which might sound lazy but is a structured way to assess opportunities [00:26:30, 00:26:37]. For each idea, he considers:
1.  **Dependencies**: What needs to happen for this idea to move forward? [00:26:57]
2.  **Perceived Outcome**: On a scale of 1 to 10, what's the best guess for the outcome? [00:27:08]
3.  **Perceived Cost (Time or Effort)**: How much effort is required? [00:27:34]

This allows him to prioritize "low-hanging fruit" – ideas with low dependencies and effort but good perceived outcomes [00:27:54].

## Post-Exit and Future Endeavors
After selling Realbase just over two years ago, Greeff entered a period of self-reflection to avoid the "trap of going next business X business X business die" [00:34:32, 00:34:41]. During this time, he focused on projects like creating a cookbook, which was not for personal gain but for creating impact [00:34:50, 00:34:53].

Now, he feels "itchy" to start something new, recognizing that while cash is important, the fulfillment and purpose generated from building a business cannot be obtained solely from money [00:35:01, 00:35:25, 00:35:29]. His current driver is to "go again" and apply lessons learned to compress the time it took to reach milestones like their first million in Realbase [00:35:54, 00:36:01]. Money, for him, remains a "score" or a "measure in business" [00:36:18, 00:36:39].

He aims for his next venture to be "rooted and grounded in impact" [00:38:21]. He cites Yasser, a founder whose large, successful business (TLC Tender Loving Care) integrates impact by employing people with disabilities throughout its supply chain, even in roles like packaging cheese [00:38:28, 00:38:37, 00:39:15]. Greeff wants to use his skills to create both business success and social impact [00:39:38].

When considering new industries, he looks for "timeless" sectors that won't be significantly affected by AI in the next 10-20 years, such as construction or "unsexy" service businesses that haven't received much attention [00:49:53, 00:50:01, 00:50:31, 00:50:41]. He explicitly avoids the "sexy" tech and AI space because of the high competition it attracts [00:46:56, 00:47:00]. He learned the importance of "choos[ing] your competitor as it is to choose your product" [00:46:44]. He gives examples like a non-sexy printing business and a niche business manufacturing car door locking systems [00:45:58, 00:54:42]. He also highlights the "multiples arbitrage" strategy in private equity, where buying and consolidating small, individual businesses (like tattoo removal shops) can create a larger, more valuable entity [00:53:06, 00:53:47].

## Advice to Aspiring Entrepreneurs

Frank Greeff offers several pieces of advice based on his [[the_journey_and_mindset_of_being_a_visionary_and_an_entrepreneur | journey and mindset]]:

*   **Clarity of Vision**: Entrepreneurs should refine their company's description into a "beautiful sound bite" or a "15-second snapshot" that others can easily articulate and understand [01:04:11, 01:05:20]. This clarity helps with sharing the message, hiring, and overall vision [01:04:50, 01:05:47].
*   **Goal Setting**: Everything should start with a clear, "big Punchy headline number" goal [01:07:39]. He advocates for "10x-ing" internal goals to push for greater achievement, even if external presentations are more realistic [01:09:54, 01:10:01]. He advises reverse-engineering steps and stages (e.g., year one, year two) to reach that top-line goal, but without getting bogged down in overly granular financial models in the early stages [01:08:16, 01:11:11].
*   **Prioritize Earning Money**: Especially in early stages, the "number one thing that you guys can do is earn money" [01:12:53, 01:12:50]. Revenue and profit solve many problems and provide the freedom to choose future directions [01:13:17, 01:13:40].

## Personal Insights

Greeff engages in extensive self-reflection through journaling, thinking, and consciously bringing subconscious thoughts to the forefront to process them [00:24:25, 01:10:59]. He noted that his internal monologue is often "silence," which might surprise others who expect constant "chitter chatter" [01:14:28, 01:14:32]. This "silent brain" allows his subconscious to process information rapidly, enabling him to respond quickly to questions [01:14:51, 01:14:56]. He also rarely experiences high stress, as indicated by low "daily stress" scores on his WHOOP fitness tracker [01:15:22, 01:15:27].

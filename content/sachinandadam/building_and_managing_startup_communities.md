## On Deck's Vision and Growth

David Booth, co-founder and chairman of On Deck, aimed to bring together individuals who wanted to become founders, helping to launch over 1,000 companies and raising over $100 million to support their ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. On Deck garnered significant attention, particularly booming on Twitter, as it became a widely discussed "culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

The company capitalized on the early pandemic era, when the world sought remote work solutions, peer connections, and new learning and development opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This created a "zeitgeist" that On Deck successfully tapped into, providing a sense of hope and progress for those looking for connection in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

### The Value of Community
On Deck fostered a platform where people could feel proud to belong, empowering them to build their careers and join a cohort of peers who had "done the work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. A key insight is that a community is often defined by those who *aren't* in it, emphasizing the importance of focus and specificity around a "job to be done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

### Structured Social Gatherings
David Booth, identifying as an introvert, disliked unstructured social gatherings. This led him to create events and communities with minimum viable structure, allowing participants to feel like they were getting the most out of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. He believes that serendipity—the magic of unexpected encounters—is best created when a group of people comes together with a purpose and with conditions that encourage vulnerability and guided conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.

### Community as a Flywheel
On Deck's model created a "bidirectional flywheel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24:00">[26:24:00]</a>:
*   On Deck Angels cohorts would connect with On Deck Founders (ODF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>.
*   ODF cohorts would seek jobs at growing startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:00">[26:28:00]</a>.
*   Podcasters and creators amplified founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:35:00">[26:35:00]</a>.
*   Cohorts were also created for specific professional roles (Engineers, Product Managers, Designers, Marketers, Chiefs of Staff) who sought growth among peers and had lost in-office outlets during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:49:00">[26:49:00]</a>.
*   Even specialized industry cohorts were formed (e.g., healthcare, deep tech, longevity tech, fintech), recognizing that potential co-founders or customers in these fields might not self-identify as founders but are operating in their industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:12:00">[27:12:00]</a>.

### Evolution of Education
On Deck aimed to disrupt "Education 1.0," the "MOOC era" of mass one-to-many online courses, which excelled at broadcasting content but failed to deliver learning outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>. On Deck sought to "return the community to the classroom" by focusing on:
*   Bringing peers together for shared learning experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:10:00">[28:10:00]</a>.
*   Emphasizing the experience and relationships built, rather than just content consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:00]</a>.
*   Highlighting the "proof of work" and sense of collegiality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a>.
*   The opportunities unlocked by a mutual sense of achievement post-program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>.

This created a multi-layered identity: the individual course, the specific cohort, the school it belongs to, and the broader On Deck ecosystem, fostering a greater likelihood of mutual support among members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:51:00">[28:51:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Shifts

On Deck experienced rapid growth, scaling from five pre-pandemic employees to 200, hiring a phenomenal unit of team members who worked together effectively despite never meeting in person due to being spread across 40 countries and 30+ states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:34:00">[31:34:00]</a>. They also took on significant funding from investors like Tiger Global <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39:00">[29:39:00]</a>.

### Navigating Market Changes
However, by early 2022, several factors led to a downturn:
1.  **Return to In-Person**: Vaccinations allowed people to gather offline, reducing engagement in digital communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a>.
2.  **Economic Shifts**: The collapse of the crypto and tech bubbles impacted business-to-business (B2B) learning and development budgets, as well as consumer discretionary spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>.
3.  **Company Structure**: On Deck had grown to 37 different communities across three business units (careers, recruiting, startups). The startups unit, which had previously foregone revenue due to a large fund, saw its committed LP Capital dry up as the market shifted, undermining the fund's ability to cover operating costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38:00">[35:38:00]</a>.

These factors necessitated significant layoffs, reducing the team from 350 to around 80 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>. Some business units were even spun out, with teams taking cash to build independently, such as the talent team that created a new company to help people find jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:16:00">[37:16:00]</a>.

## Current Focus and Future of Community

On Deck scaled back to focus on its core roots: [[building_a_successful_tech_startup | building relationships]] offline to grow networks online, and re-anchoring in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:26:00">[38:26:00]</a>. The current model involves intensive week-long retreats with cohorts of ambitious individuals, fostering network building and conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:10:00">[39:10:00]</a>.

### The Golden Rule of Silicon Valley
David Booth advocates for a "Golden Rule of Silicon Valley": treat people as if they are the next unicorn founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. This means being helpful to those around you, as they may remember you, invest with you, offer referrals, or even join your company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. It emphasizes taking young people seriously and providing honest, constructive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:47:00">[56:47:00]</a>.

For startups in regions like New Zealand and Australia, cultivating an ecosystem and "helping to seed the tadpoles into the river" is crucial, with the hope they will grow into frogs and remember the support they received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:09:00">[55:09:00]</a>. This means creating programs and communities that can efficiently scale support for early-stage founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:16:00">[57:16:00]</a>.

### The Power of Networks and Connections
A significant "superpower" for David Booth has been his extensive network, built through involvement in organizations like New Zealand Venture, AngelList, and On Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>. This allows him to connect founders with others, routing introductions that can be crucial for companies in less connected markets like Australia and New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>. He believes that founders, especially those pursuing a venture path, should invest in relationships with other ambitious people and consider immersing themselves in global tech hubs like San Francisco to gain experience and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:27:00">[57:27:00]</a>.

### Investing in Ecosystems
His role at Blackbird, a venture capital firm, aligns with this philosophy. Blackbird focuses on cultivating and developing the ecosystem through initiatives like the Sunrise Festival, offering early exposure to the "possible," access to mentors, and structured programs like Startmate or The Foundry for deep tech scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:11:00">[55:11:00]</a>. This contrasts with Silicon Valley's focus on allocating capital to experienced founders; in New Zealand, it's about nurturing the entire ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:49:00">[54:49:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to make more role models available and paint pathways for the future generation of builders in the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>.

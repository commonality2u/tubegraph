## Introduction to Moses Low and Zendit
Moses Low, an Australian-raised fintech entrepreneur, is the founder of Zendit, a company that became the first Indonesian business to go through [[building_a_successful_tech_startup | Y Combinator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Zendit, often likened to the "Stripe of Southeast Asia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, focuses on enabling digital payments in a rapidly growing region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>.

## Building Zendit: A Fintech Journey
Moses Low's journey into fintech began at a young age with an early interest in entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. At 13, a "life game" at school where he and a friend monopolized the doctor and electronics businesses, leading to a teacher suggesting he pursue business, set his path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. This experience, coupled with a fascination for the capital reserve system and banks' ability to "print money," ignited his ambition to own a bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

### The "Cockroach Mentality"
Living in Indonesia, Moses embraced what he calls the "cockroach story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Inspired by advice from his mentor Justin Khan (founder of Twitch), the "cockroach mentality" emphasizes survival and doing "whatever it takes to survive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. This approach, valuing persistence and functional ingenuity over outward appearances, became a core internal operating principle for Zendit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

### Educational and Career Path
Moses pursued Finance and Information Systems at UNSW, recognizing that technology would be key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. Early exposure to Atlassian, a company founded by UNSW alumni, provided his first understanding of a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

He then joined BCG as a management consultant to learn how to run businesses and "learn to think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Consulting offered insights into how CEOs think and how to structure thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. He left after two years, finding it a suitable period for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.

His goal was to get to Silicon Valley, which he saw as the hub for big ideas and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. He pursued an MBA at Berkeley, which provided access to the Valley's extensive network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.

### The Y Combinator Experience
[[building_a_successful_tech_startup | Y Combinator]] (YC) is described as the "most prestigious accelerator in the world," offering mentorship from significant figures in startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Moses participated in two YC programs: YC proper (for early-stage) and YC Growth (for growth-stage companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>.

Key benefits of YC included:
1.  **Pressure Cooker Environment**: Being surrounded by highly successful companies pushed them to work harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>.
2.  **Quality Advice**: Receiving advice from billion-dollar founders like Justin Khan, who could share specific experiences from companies like Twitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>. This advice was crucial for Zendit's pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>.
3.  **Demo Day Exposure**: YC's Demo Day created a platform where Zendit, despite being from Indonesia (a less known market in 2015), was positioned as a "hottest company for a day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>.

### Product-Market Fit and Growth Strategy
Zendit's initial product-market fit came rapidly, achieving 16,000 users in six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>. Their strategy mirrored methods used by companies like Uber and PayPal: giving away money for free to incentivize user acquisition and referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>. This approach aims to create behavioral change and user stickiness, allowing for monetization later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>.

### The Role of a Non-Technical Founder
Despite not having a computer science background, Moses learned to code and built Zendit's initial website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:42:00">[36:42:00]</a>. This hands-on experience helped him understand developers' perspectives and engage in technical conversations, a minimum requirement for a business person building a tech company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:54:00">[36:54:00]</a>.

## Understanding the Future of Payments in Southeast Asia
Zendit positions itself as the "Stripe of Southeast Asia," providing businesses with payments infrastructure, including accepting money, payout services, and holding money (escrow, custodian, bank accounts as a service) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:00">[28:49:00]</a>. They also build value-added services adjacent to payments, such as data products, KYC (Know Your Customer) products, and a [[digital_banking_and_lending_models | lending]] product based on customer cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:19:00">[29:19:00]</a>.

### Key Trends and Market Opportunity
Moses highlights several macro trends enabling Zendit's success in Southeast Asia:
*   **Demographics**: The region includes Indonesia, the fourth-largest country on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>, with an average age under 30 (50% of the population is under 30) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:14:00">[30:14:00]</a>.
*   **Technology Adoption**: Mobile phone penetration exceeds 100% (average person has more than one phone), and smartphone penetration is around 80% and growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:21:00">[30:21:00]</a>. Many users skipped laptops/desktops and went straight to mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>.
*   **Social Media Usage**: Southeast Asian cities are among the most social in the world, with high daily active users for platforms like Twitter and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:37:00">[30:37:00]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure Gaps**: Despite high tech adoption, existing infrastructure is "extremely poor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>. In Indonesia specifically, there was no single API for accepting payments and no APIs at all for sending money at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>. This void presented a clear opportunity to build essential digital infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:00">[33:01:00]</a>.

### Future of Payments in the Region
Looking ahead, Moses predicts:
*   **Persistence of Cash**: Cash will continue to play a significant role in Southeast Asia for at least the next 10 years, due to demographics and entrenched behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:54:00">[33:54:00]</a>.
*   **E-wallets and Digital Cash**: While e-wallets currently rely heavily on incentives for usage, there will be a continued shift from physical cash to digital cash in various forms, including bank transfers, e-wallets, or direct merchant payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:06:00">[34:06:00]</a>.
*   **Growth of Digital Infrastructure**: The region's transition to fully digital and service economies requires robust digital infrastructure, including cloud, email, CRM, payments, credit risk, and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:37:00">[38:37:00]</a>. Moses believes local players like Zendit are best positioned to win in areas like payments and tax invoicing, aiming to build multiple multi-billion-dollar infrastructure companies in Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:00">[39:57:00]</a>.

### Cryptocurrency in the Region
Regarding crypto, Moses notes that each Southeast Asian country treats it differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:07:00">[35:07:00]</a>. In Indonesia, it's allowed as an asset (like gold) but not as currency or a medium of exchange, restricting its use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:00">[35:10:00]</a>. While Zendit itself started at a Bitcoin hackathon, they haven't seen demand for crypto payments in the region, but remain "bullish that there's something there" for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:36:00">[35:36:00]</a>. This openness to innovation aligns with the broader [[the_future_impact_of_blockchain_and_fintech_in_emerging_markets | decentralization]] theme often discussed in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:04:00">[36:04:00]</a>.

## Personal Mission and Legacy
Beyond building a successful company, Moses is driven by a personal mission to "foster up the path" for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:27:00">[40:27:00]</a>. He aims to create a "Zendit mafia," akin to the "PayPal mafia," where early employees go on to build their own successful, impactful companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:40:00">[40:40:00]</a>. This vision focuses on empowering a new generation of entrepreneurs who care about doing good and building companies that change the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:59:00">[40:59:00]</a>.

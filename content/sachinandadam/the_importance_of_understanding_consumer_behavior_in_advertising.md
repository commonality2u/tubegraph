Understanding [[building_a_consumer_brand | consumer behavior]] is paramount in advertising, especially with the evolving media landscape. Two founders, Jack White and Sam Krenberg, highlight that the ultimate goal is to "create a world where people actually do enjoy watching ads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:58">[00:58:58]</a>. This philosophy underpins their approach to [[ai_and_advertising | AI and advertising]].

## The Problem with Traditional Advertising Models

Historically, advertising agencies focused on channels like direct mail, TV spots, and out-of-home advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. However, when digital media and platforms like Facebook emerged, many traditional agencies failed to adapt, merely "chopping it down a little bit" and treating social channels like TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

This led to widespread frustration with the quality of digital advertisements:
> "most of the ads online today are pretty rubbish, right? Like the internet is just filled with terrible ads." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>

This "internet garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a> is a direct result of not understanding how consumers engage with content on new platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

## Quality and Resonance Over Mere Quantity

For consumers, what makes an ad effective is its ability to resonate and connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. People enjoy good ads, which are essentially good concepts executed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. Focusing solely on optimization (e.g., button color or click-through rates) without a strong creative concept is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

> "People still want it. Like we are it's even more prevalent now because the amount of content we watch. We sit on YouTube. We like I watch so much content now on YouTube that if something popped into that feed that wasn't meant to be, I'd be pissed off because that algorithm starts to know you. It recommends things you like. So when the ad comes in, it should come in that way, too." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>

The key to success in modern advertising lies in providing both **quality and quantity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. While AI can generate high volumes of content, the challenge is ensuring that content is meaningful and impactful to the audience.

### The Human Touch in Advertising

Even with advanced [[ai_and_advertising | AI]], the human element remains critical. Research suggests that when people believe they are interacting with a human, they rate the experience higher than when they know it's AI-generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. This highlights an innate human craving for "recognition of other humans" and appreciation for human effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. Just as an original Picasso is valued differently from a copy, human-generated content carries a premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

## Adapting to Consumer Mindset

Cutible, the company founded by Jack and Sam, discovered the [[the_importance_of_focus_in_media_and_business | importance of focus]] on the customer's mindset rather than their size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. They pivoted to target businesses with an "experimental mindset, a progressive mindset" who understand how technology works now and how advertising should function in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. These smaller and medium-sized businesses were already building their companies on platforms like Facebook, caring more about getting "more ads out to see what works to grow our business" than adhering to traditional constructs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>.

Cutible's methodology involves:
*   **Understanding Brand DNA:** Helping brands find their authentic voice and how they speak to their audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.
*   **Batch Testing:** Running ads in batches to test different concepts and letting algorithms decide what resonates with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. This builds a moat of understanding what works for a specific brand over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.
*   **Breaking Traditional Constructs:** Recognizing that traditional ad lengths (30s, 15s) and formats don't matter as much in social media, where creativity and adaptability are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>.

## Product-Market Fit (PMF) and Customer Disappointment

A key metric for Cutible is Product-Market Fit (PMF), which gauges how disappointed customers would be if the product no longer existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>. This emphasizes a deep understanding of customer needs and the product's value proposition.

## The Future of Advertising

The constant evolution of AI means that content quality will always be pushed forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. The challenge remains for AI to make the next creative leap, not just replicate existing state-of-the-art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. The goal is not just more generated video in people's feeds, but "good ideas" and "good creative entertainment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.

Ultimately, regardless of the tools, **good creative wins** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. People will continue to talk about great ideas executed well, whether it's a film or an advertisement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. This focus on true creative quality, driven by an understanding of what consumers want to see and connect with, will define success in the evolving advertising industry.

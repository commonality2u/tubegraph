African economies present a unique blend of challenges and opportunities, particularly in the realm of financial technology and social impact.

## The Vision: Making Money While Doing Good

The founder of Zark, Kevan, was born in the US to Bangladeshi immigrant parents and felt privileged to have opportunities that many in his ancestral land did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This inspired his interest in development economics, focusing on understanding why some countries are rich and others poor, and how to bridge that gap by bringing opportunities to those who need them most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. He believes it's possible to "make money while also doing good," sharing wealth and developing a country rather than just an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### For-Profit Model for Scalability

Zark operates as a for-profit business, a conscious decision made to achieve the greatest scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. This model allows for continuous reinvestment into the business and is not dependent on philanthropy, which can run out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. The vision is for Zark to become the biggest digital bank in Africa, serving as a conduit for trillions of dollars of investments into the continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. Investors can achieve higher returns in Africa than in the West, while simultaneously creating jobs and doubling the income of people living in poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

## [[fintech_growth_in_africa | Fintech Growth in Africa]]

Uganda, where Zark is based, boasts the highest entrepreneurship rate in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. However, 2.5 billion people globally lack access to credit, trapping them in a [[challenges and insights in microfinance | poverty cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

### Historical Context and Financial Gaps

Historically, institutions like microfinance organizations have filled gaps left by large commercial banks, reaching even the most remote villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. They pioneered underwriting models for individuals without traditional assets, relying instead on community guarantees and trustworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

A humorous but illustrative example highlights the banking challenges: in Uganda, less than 5% of the population has a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Farmers often find pigs more liquid than cash because they are accessible, appreciate in value, and can be easily sold locally, unlike bank accounts which require costly and unreliable trips to town, with potential bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. This highlights the structural and cultural reasons why traditional saving is difficult; family networks often act as a social safety net, making personal savings quickly redistributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

### Technological Leapfrogging

East Africa has seen significant technological leapfrogging, bypassing outdated Western technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. For example, mobile money systems allow instantaneous transactions, unlike the slower wire transfers in the US which rely on payment technologies from the 1960s and 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The lack of widespread bank accounts and landline telephones in East Africa allowed for the direct adoption of mobile phone towers, cheaper handsets, and micro-payments for airtime, making mobile technology widely accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

This phenomenon extends to credit, with China leapfrogging credit cards to adopt QR codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Zark's Business Model and Impact

Zark started in June 2016, initially offering cash loans for various business purposes, including agriculture and retail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. A key learning was that cash was fungible, often diverted to other needs like school fees or medical treatment, hindering loan repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

### Pivot to Asset-Based Lending

Zark pivoted to "lending in kind," focusing on productive, income-generating assets, specifically motorcycle loans for taxi/bodaboda drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This model ensures the asset is used for income generation, and the required down payment gives the borrower "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.
A typical bodaboda driver spends 50% of their income renting a motorcycle, never building equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Ownership allows them to accumulate wealth and escape the [[challenges and insights in microfinance | poverty cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. Zark's repayment rates are 96%, demonstrating borrowers' willingness and ability to repay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.

This specialization simplifies the underwriting process, as Zark only needs to understand the mechanics and income potential of motorcycles, leading to a more systematic and streamlined approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>. By creating collateral through the loan itself (GPS trackers, insurance), Zark avoids requiring pre-existing assets, expanding its market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

### Path to Growth

Zark leverages partnerships with ride-hailing apps like SafeBoda in Uganda, gaining access to behavioral and financial data (e.g., number of trips, customer ratings) to assess credit risk in lieu of traditional bank statements or titled assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>. They also aim for international partnerships with global banks for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.
Zark boasts the fastest turnaround time in its industry (three days) and offers automated secondary loan products (personal, fuel, smartphone loans), which brick-and-mortar lenders struggle to compete with due to manual processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

### Digital Credit in Africa: Risks and Solutions

While digital credit can reduce costs for borrowers, some digital lenders in Kenya charge exorbitant interest rates (up to 300% APR) on unsecured consumer loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. These loans are often used for unproductive purposes like gambling, leading to high default rates and necessitating high interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>. Zark's focus on business-purpose loans that increase borrower income drastically reduces risk, creating a "virtuous circle" of lower costs and cheaper credit for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_reflections_in_business_decision_making | Challenges and Reflections in Business Decision Making]] in African Economies

Despite the growth opportunities, skepticism about investing in Africa persists due to concerns about the rule of law and weaker institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. For example, the Ugandan court system is slow, with lawsuits pending for years, making it difficult to enforce loan agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>. Credit reference bureaus are also not as strong, limiting lenders' ability to report defaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.

### Mitigating Risks Through Innovation

To address these challenges, Zark utilizes GPS trackers in motorcycles that can cut off fuel to the engine if payments stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. This means a driver cannot use the bike, directly impacting their daily income, as many live day-to-day and cannot afford even one day without their motorcycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>. While such practices might not be allowed in the US due to privacy laws, Ugandan borrowers accept them as a means to access credit without traditional requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.

This tech-driven asset security has allowed Zark to achieve a 3% default rate on motorcycle loans in Africa, outperforming US auto loan lenders (5.8% default rate) despite weaker legal systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.

### Importance of Local Integration

Building a successful business in Africa requires living there, experiencing local challenges, and integrating with local society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. Many competitors' CEOs do not reside in Africa, making it difficult for them to understand and solve African problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>. Kevan has chosen to live in Africa long-term and is learning three local languages to ensure buy-in from local people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. Treating local communities with dignity and building solutions collaboratively is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>.

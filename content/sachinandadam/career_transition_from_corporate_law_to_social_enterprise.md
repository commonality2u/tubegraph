Cat, a guest on "The Sachin Adam Show," has forged a diverse career path, transitioning from corporate law to leadership roles in social enterprise and venture capital. Her journey highlights the potential for individuals to align their professional lives with their personal values, even if it means deviating from conventional paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Early Career and Dissonance

Growing up in country Western Australia from a financially struggling family, Cat's parents encouraged her to pursue a financially secure career, suggesting paths like doctor, lawyer, or engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Despite this, Cat felt a strong internal desire to help people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Initially, she perceived financial security and impactful work as mutually exclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

Her entry into law school at Murdoch University was influenced by her parents' mindset, and she initially considered human rights law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. However, the curriculum often funneled students towards corporate and commercial paths, leading her to feel caught up in the "groupthink" of her peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Her passionate engagement in law school, including becoming president of the Australian Law Students Association, cemented a feeling that she "had to double down on the law thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

This led her to pursue a "safe path" pre-laid out by society, despite an internal entrepreneurial and humanitarian drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Corporate Law at Clayton Utz

Cat began her corporate law career at Clayton Utz in Sydney, working as a banking and finance lawyer during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. While she acknowledged the immense training and exposure to world-class thinking and contacts the firm provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, she experienced significant "dissonance" between her internal desires and external career expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

The culture at top-tier law firms, while offering unparalleled training, was described as having "psychological terror" due to its use of fear of missing out, fear of not being good enough, and competitive tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This environment of "tough love" meant that work-life balance was often promised but rarely delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Her experience at Clayton Utz contributed to her [[navigating_corporate_careers_and_burnout | navigating corporate careers and burnout]].

## Transition to Social Enterprise: Grameen Australia

Despite the corporate environment, Cat continued to seek opportunities that would align with her desire for impact. Her [[journey_from_employment_to_entrepreneurship | journey from employment to entrepreneurship]] took an unexpected turn through her network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. A former colleague vouched for her, leading to an interview at Perpetual, a funds management company, despite her limited direct experience in the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. This showcased how underlying qualities like adaptability and influencing skills can transcend specific CV descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

After Perpetual, where she managed significant deals and built a continuous improvement program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>, Cat's next major step was into the [[social_enterprise_and_fitness | social enterprise]] world as CEO of Grameen Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. This opportunity arose organically through a contact who thought she'd be a good mentor for her. This led to a call from Lynley Edwards, a board member of Grameen Australia, who offered Cat the CEO position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. Despite not having a microfinance or not-for-profit background, her transferable skills and genuine approach to connecting with people paved the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.

### Grameen's Mission and Microfinance

Grameen Bank, founded by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh, pioneered microfinance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>. The core problem it addressed was the inability of poor individuals to start businesses due to a lack of asset collateral for loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. Yunus's innovation was "social collateral," where groups of five borrowers were collectively responsible for repaying individual loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. This model incentivized repayment and fostered community support, leading to high repayment rates (97% in Bangladesh) and significant poverty reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.

Grameen operates as a "social business," meaning it generates interest to fund its own expansion, rather than relying solely on grants like a charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. This [[intersection_of_business_and_social_impact | intersection of business and social impact]] was a key attraction for Cat.

As CEO of Grameen Australia, Cat's role was to adapt this model for Australia, opening its constitution to operate locally, demerging from Asian operations, and assembling resources to pilot microfinance in places like Doveton, Melbourne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. She held this role from 2018 to early 2020, eventually transitioning to the board as an operational CEO took over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.

## Current Role and Future Aspirations

After Grameen, Cat found herself in the [[transition_from_venture_capital_to_entrepreneurship | venture capital]] and accelerator space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. She joined Catalyze, a unique firm that operates as a collective of business owners and ex-CEOs, offering "management consulting and venture capital on demand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. They work with validated startups, aiming to scale them to liquidity events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.

At Catalyze, Cat is a commercial director for Squadify, a team performance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. This role allows her to live out a long-held dream of scaling startups and helping teams realize their ambitions without burning out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>. The model is performance-based, with consultants having a stake in the business, which requires a particular risk appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.

Looking ahead, Cat envisions a "portfolio career" focusing on [[social_venture_capital_and_impact_investing | impact investing]] and potentially moving into civic society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. She aims to combine making a living with making a difference, adapting her skills where they can make a unique contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

The emergence of [[the_path_to_achieving_artificial_general_intelligence_agi | Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)]] is anticipated to profoundly reshape industries and redefine the value of human contributions, making it increasingly difficult to predict future trends compared to decades past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Transformation of Industries

### Healthcare
Initially, the idea that [[impact_of_ai_on_employment_and_the_future_of_work | AI doctors]] would exist and healthcare would become an informatics or technology problem was met with skepticism, with many emphasizing the "human touch" in medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. However, with the development of large language models like ChatGPT performing well as a doctor, more people are accepting the potential of [[impact_of_ai_on_employment_and_the_future_of_work | AI in healthcare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. To truly transform healthcare, the focus must shift from simply hiring and training more doctors to leveraging technology, specifically [[artificial_intelligence_and_workforce_transformation | AI]], to process vast amounts of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

Companies like Superpower utilize [[rise_of_ai_agents_and_their_practical_applications_in_business | AI]] to connect complex health data points, a task that would take doctors hours to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. The next phase for [[rise_of_ai_agents_and_their_practical_applications_in_business | AI]] involves enabling it to perform tasks that humans could never achieve, thereby exceeding current medical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

### White-Collar Professions
The advent of [[the_path_to_achieving_artificial_general_intelligence_agi | AGI]] is expected to have a significant impact on white-collar professions, particularly junior roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>. Junior lawyers, doctors (not physically related tasks), accountants, bankers, advertisers, and marketers may find their roles commoditized, as [[impact_of_ai_on_employment_and_the_future_of_work | AI]] can handle much of the "busy work" and skill-based tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. This means that [[ai_and_its_implications_for_society | AI]] will amplify output, turning 1X efforts into 1X, 2X efforts into 4X, and 10X efforts into 100X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. Consequently, it becomes more crucial than ever to be a "100xer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. This shift is likely to increase the inequality in the distribution of skills and talent, potentially necessitating Universal Basic Income (UBI) as 1X individuals compete with 100X capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:55">[00:50:55]</a>.

## The Enduring Role of People

In a post-[[the_path_to_achieving_artificial_general_intelligence_agi | AGI]] world, while information, skill, knowledge, and coding become commoditized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>, several human-centric elements will remain scarce and vital:

*   **Relationships between People** Relationships continue to be scarce and capable of unlocking defensibility, with people remaining as gatekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. The top "tech bros" are, in reality, "people bros" who inherently understand the profound importance of human connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>.
*   **Things that Exist in the Real World** Industries and activities that interface with the physical world will gain importance. Examples include:
    *   Healthcare, which still requires real-world diagnostics and therapeutics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.
    *   Deep tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>.
    *   Real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>.
    *   Space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.
    *   Hard sciences, which become more interesting than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>.

As the cost of digital goods approaches zero, the importance of real-world interactions and tangible assets will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. This contrasts with the traditional venture capital focus on high-gross margin, pure-play software businesses, which are likely to be among the first disrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. Businesses with lower gross margins and significant operational complexity, like Airbnb or Uber, may possess a stronger moat because software alone no longer offers defensibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>.

Ultimately, the future will see a rise in the value of "people bros" and a heightened importance of real-world interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>. Max's chosen word for the year, "magic," reflects the pursuit of exponential output from input and the exploration of "woo-woo" or mystical concepts that may eventually be explained by science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>.

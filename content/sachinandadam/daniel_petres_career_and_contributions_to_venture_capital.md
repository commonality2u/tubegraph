Daniel Petr is described as the "grandfather of VC in Australia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, known for his remarkable career in Australian tech and his pioneering approach to leadership that combines success with being a "good human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Early Career and Influences

Petr's career began at Microsoft, where he served as a Vice President, working directly under Bill Gates in the company's early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. He credits this period as a crucial piece of luck in his work context, providing him with close proximity to Bill Gates and other "crazy smart people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This experience taught him how to think about problems and modifications to solution sets, skills that remained with him throughout his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

He highlights Bill Gates as a significant role model due to his dedication to making the world a better place and his systematic approach to solving problems, whether in business or the non-profit sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Bill Gates was always thinking about pivoting to philanthropy once he reached a certain point in his Microsoft career, which influenced Petr's own thinking about that aspect of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

During his time at Microsoft in the US, Petr observed a culture where people discussed philanthropy at dinners, a contrast to discussions about house prices in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This cultural difference prompted him to reflect on Australia's lower philanthropic engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

## Transition to Venture Capital

After his tenure at Microsoft, Petr embarked on a significant career in [[Key investments and experiences in venture capital | venture capital]], running three different venture funds:
*   Ecorp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>
*   Nuseed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   AirTree, which grew to become the biggest venture fund in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>

Petr notes that he earned "a lot more money post Microsoft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a> from his venture capital endeavors.

## Contributions and Philosophy in Venture Capital

Petr champions a unique [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | venture capital perspective]] that prioritizes being a "good human" alongside professional success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. He articulates that achieving 15-20% internal rate of return (IRR) while being a good person is "better than getting 40-50% IRR" without ethical considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This ethos underscores his belief that one's purpose and what they want their life to be about are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

He advocates for a "caring venture capitalist" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, contrasting it with professions where caring is not explicitly rewarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Petr emphasizes that the most fulfilling thing one can do is help others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, a sentiment he believes should extend into the professional realm.

Regarding the [[The challenges and rewards of securing venture capital | venture capital]] ecosystem, Petr observes a power dynamic where successful companies receive attention, while struggling companies are often neglected by VC firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>. He calls for more feedback from founders to challenge VC firms to "lift their game in terms of delivering what you said you're going to deliver" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>.

## Philanthropic Advocacy and Start Giving

A significant part of Petr's later career is devoted to philanthropy. He founded "Start Giving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, an initiative focused on helping allocate philanthropic funds and encouraging tech billionaires to contribute to charities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

Petr argues for greater accountability for the wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>, stating that billionaires not giving a substantial portion of their money to causes should be "called out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. He believes it is unacceptable for individuals to possess vast wealth without considering those suffering or lacking opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

His vision for Australian society includes:
*   **Tax Reform**: Rich people should pay more tax, with funds directed to social services for a fairer and more equal society, particularly for education and health services for those without economic or social backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.
*   **Accountability in Charity**: All charities should be compelled to report their metrics and financial expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>, with non-compliance leading to loss of status and consolidation into larger, more effective pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.

He dismisses the argument from some billionaires that they are better capital allocators than charities and prefer to wait to give, suggesting it's often an "excuse mechanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. He encourages immediate, smaller contributions rather than waiting for "perfect philanthropic guru" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

## Vision for Australian Tech and Innovation

Petr expresses strong optimism for innovation as the future of the Australian economy and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. He sees the growth in the [[Venture capital and angel investing | venture capital]] industry as a vital catalyst for driving this environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>.

However, he cautions that the industry might be "a little bit ahead of ourselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>, noting that the ease of investment returns from 2012-2020 has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. He advises against continued over-indexing to "marketing than to delivery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.

For the future, Petr suggests:
*   **More Scaled Thematic Funds**: Especially in under-invested areas like AgriTech, BioTech, MedTech, and Climate Tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>. These deeper domain spaces require more specialized knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>.
*   **Less General-Purpose Funds**: Indicating a shift away from broad software-as-a-service (SaaS) and e-commerce investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>.

He believes Australia's prolific research base in medical and agricultural fields makes it well-positioned to convert research into global high-tech products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Work-Life Balance

Petr's career has been shaped by a deep-seated desire for intrinsic validation, stemming from childhood experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>. He continuously asks himself, "How can I prove I'm a good person?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:48">[01:14:48]</a>, which translates into a focus on helping others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>.

He learned early in his career, particularly after the birth of his daughter in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>, that work-life balance was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. He actively sought to "achieve the required outcomes of my work role with the minimum effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>, fostering efficiency rather than prolonged work hours. This approach led to tripling revenue and market share in his Microsoft group, alongside positive feedback from employees' families about improved personal lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.

> "Work can be like a cancer; nothing will stop work seeping into your life to every facet of it. You have to put the barriers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>

Petr asserts that a good life outside of work enhances productivity and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>. His core philosophy emphasizes:
*   Taking responsibility for actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>
*   Always seeking the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>
*   Focusing on not doing harm to others and apologizing if harm is done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>
*   Keeping everything in perspective and recognizing "we are one Humanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>

He maintains that while professional success is important, true fulfillment comes from investing time in relationships, family, and community, ensuring a "good life" beyond material gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>. Petr acknowledges that the "best stuff you read" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:19">[01:13:19]</a> about tech often comes from overseas sources, and there's a lack of deep technology reporting in Australian media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>.

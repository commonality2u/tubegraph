Space imaging has become a critical capability in the context of a [[the_new_space_race_and_global_satellite_boom | new space race]] involving governments, adversaries, and private entities like Elon Musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This race is characterized by a [[the_new_space_race_and_global_satellite_boom | dramatic boom in the amount of satellites]] in Earth orbit and increasing instances of countries spying on each other in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Need for Space Imaging

The number of objects launched into space remained relatively stationary between 1965 and 2010, but then began to rise dramatically, reaching over 2,600 objects per year by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Experts predict that the number of active satellites could grow from approximately 3,000 a few years ago to 100,000 within the next seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This surge is driven by cheaper launch costs, making space more accessible for commercial companies (like SpaceX), other countries (like China), and academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

This proliferation of satellites introduces several challenges, including debris, maintenance issues, and the aforementioned problem of governmental espionage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The ability to [[role_of_startups_in_space_surveillance_and_satellite_monitoring | monitor what is going on in space]] has become paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Geopolitical Impact on Space Collaboration
Historically, space exploration fostered deep collaboration, exemplified by projects like the International Space Station (ISS), which brought together former adversaries like the US and Russia for the benefit of humankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. However, this collaborative spirit is being displaced by the same dynamics of competition and dominance seen on Earth, largely due to [[impact_of_geopolitics_on_space_collaboration | rising powers and shifting power dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Challenges in Imaging
Imaging objects in space is "really, really hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Factors such as imaging distance, velocity, and lighting conditions significantly affect image quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Furthermore, the lack of transparency in space can be exploited by malicious actors, leading to potential conflict on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Heo: An Australian Space Imaging Solution
Heo, a [[role_of_startups_in_space_surveillance_and_satellite_monitoring | small Australian startup]], plays a critical role in addressing these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Originally an asteroid mining company founded in 2016, Heo pivoted two years in when they realized asteroid mining wasn't a significant business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. They shifted their focus to monitoring other satellites, finding a massive market in solving satellite-related problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The technology they developed for asteroid imaging was directly transferable to satellite imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

Heo's mission is to "make space transparent" by being able to image anything in the solar system on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### Heo's Technology and Operations
Heo operates as both a hardware and software company, which provides them with a strong competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

#### Hardware
Heo builds cameras and sensors that go on spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. They either rent time on other companies' cameras in space or build their own and provide them to other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Their lab in Botany, Sydney, is where they manufacture these cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

*   **Manufacturing Process**: Optics assembly is performed in a clean environment, using a laminar flow cabinet to prevent dust contamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. They utilize lasers and mirrors for optical system alignment to achieve correct performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Camera Models**:
    *   **Holmes**: Their smaller camera, with the first one launched in June 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
    *   **Larger Telescope**: A bigger model with the first launch planned for the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

#### Software
Heo's cameras capture footage that is then analyzed by complex software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Data Processing**: The software hunts through data sets, uses AI to locate target satellites, enhances images, and delivers them to customers with additional insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Image Capture**: Satellites take images in bands over 2-3 second periods, with specific exposure and frame rates, aiming to capture the target satellite as it passes by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Image Quality Optimization**: Heo's R&D focuses on optimizing camera usage (considering imaging distance, velocity, lighting) and applying post-processing to improve image quality for customers and governments, enabling better decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

Heo serves a range of commercial and government customers, including the Australian Space Agency, UK Space Agency, and various national security agencies in the US, Japan, Australia, and the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Addressing Space Debris
Heo helps space agencies track debris or defunct satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Deorbiting satellites over uninhabited parts of Earth is the safest way to manage them after their mission is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Recent incidents, such as a house in Florida being damaged by a battery from the ISS and a SpaceX debris falling near a farmer's home in Australia, highlight the growing issue of space debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Maintaining the "spatial resource" by identifying non-working satellites and enabling their removal is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

## Regulatory and Competitive Landscape

The space imaging industry is highly sensitive and intertwined with government sales, making it susceptible to regulatory changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. For example, US monopoly laws previously prevented US companies from entering the market that Heo was operating in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Heo's activities in Australia actually triggered the change of this law about 18 months prior, opening up the market to other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

Despite the increased competition, Heo, as a first-mover, maintains a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. They view this change as an opportunity to partner with US companies that were previously prohibited from this type of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. By renting time on other satellites and monetizing their downtime, Heo can onboard sensors from the US that were previously inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Heo anticipates that space will become a more transparent place within the next five years, with their company playing a significant role in this transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. [[predicting_future_trends_in_society_space_art_and_technology | Space is poised to play an increasingly large role in everyday life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. Heo, like many emerging Australian tech companies, represents a new wave of innovation making an impact on the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

Combating climate change and inequality can be achieved through strategic investment, particularly within the superannuation sector. This approach leverages the significant financial power held by individuals and institutions to drive positive environmental and social outcomes.

## The Power of Superannuation

Australia's superannuation sector holds approximately three trillion dollars, making it the fourth largest pool of investable assets globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This unique system allows each individual to determine how their money is invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Decisions made today regarding superannuation investment can influence the world that exists when individuals retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. For most Australians, their superannuation will be their largest asset until their house is paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

Consolidating multiple superannuation accounts and choosing ethical funds is simple, despite the industry sometimes incentivizing complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

## Future Super: A Case Study

Future Super, co-founded by Kirsten Hunter, operates as a superannuation fund with a specific "theory of change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Its core purpose is to build a prosperous future free from [[climate_change_and_storytelling | climate change]] and inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>. The fund was established after its original co-founders' attempt to enter politics to stop carbon trading legislation repeal was unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Future Super aims to wield the power of money to influence the status quo in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This involves:
*   **Ethical Investment**: Providing Australians who care about [[cam_adamss_perspective_on_climate_change | climate change]] with an option to align their superannuation investments with their values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Macro-Scale Influence**: Demonstrating a better path for investment within the existing capitalist system to influence larger super funds (e.g., Hesta, UniSuper, Australian Super) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This includes encouraging them to divest from fossil fuels and implement "negative screening" (ruling out investments in armaments, old-growth logging, animal cruelty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
*   **Policy Development**: Creating progressive internal policies that can be adopted by other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

### Addressing Inequality through Policy

Future Super has implemented specific superannuation policies for its staff to address the gap in retirement savings, particularly for women who typically retire with 47% less superannuation than men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. These policies, disproportionately benefiting women, include:
*   **Higher Super Rate for Lower Earners**: Any staff member earning under $80,000 annually receives a higher rate of superannuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>.
*   **Parental Leave Superannuation**: Full 12 months of superannuation paid during parental leave, unlike standard parental leave which only covers salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.
*   **Full-time Equivalent Super for Part-time Carers**: Part-time workers who are also carers have their superannuation paid as if they were working full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.

These internal policies gained attention and were subsequently adopted by other companies, demonstrating the ripple effect of progressive practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

## Systemic Change and a Vision for the Future

Kirsten Hunter believes that the current capitalist system is "broken" because it rewards behaviors that harm the planet and create inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>. Her vision for a utopia includes:
*   **Profit without Detriment**: A world where profit is not achieved at the expense of people and the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.
*   **Rewarding Good**: Profit is rewarded to companies and individuals who contribute positively to society, directly linking profitability with [[future_trends_in_impact_measurement_and_investment | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.
*   **Consequence for Harmful Behavior**: Implementation of measures, such as taxation, to penalize actions that damage the environment or exacerbate inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.

There is a growing shift towards a new economic system, driven by younger generations who, as consumers and employees, are increasingly demanding ethically manufactured and fair-trade products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. They are willing to pay higher fees for superannuation that aligns with their values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>, highlighting the significant [[the_role_of_innovation_in_climate_solutions | role of innovation in climate solutions]] and consumer demand in driving change.

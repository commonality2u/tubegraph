David Shein, founder of Australia's first unicorn company Comtech and co-founder of OIF, emphasizes the crucial role of identifying and cultivating talent in the success of startups. His insights stem from his personal journey and extensive experience in the Australian startup ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## David Shein's Philosophy on Talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>
Shein's book, "The Dumbest Guy at the Table," reflects his belief that his core skill lies in discerning talent, particularly in individuals smarter than himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. This approach is fundamental to his work in venture capital today, where early-stage investing relies heavily on gut feeling about a founder's ability to execute, rather than just numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

### Prioritizing Attitude Over Skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>
A key principle for Shein is to [[hiring_strategies_and_identifying_talent | hire for attitude and train for skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. He recounts instances where he hired exceptional individuals without even reviewing their resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. This contrasts sharply with modern [[hiring_strategies_and_identifying_talent | hiring practices]] that often over-rely on formal qualifications and prestigious backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.

### Spotting Undervalued Talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>
Shein's career is marked by his ability to identify and nurture undervalued talent:
*   **Scott Petty:** Hired at 18 years old, Petty moved through six different roles at Comtech, from technical support to Chief Technology Officer, eventually becoming the CTO of Vodafone in the UK. He did not have a university degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.
*   **Dave Colvin:** Hired from a competitor's warehouse, Colvin was an exceptional tech support person despite not having a university degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. Shein noted that his competitor would not give Colvin a tech support job due to his appearance (long hair and an earring), highlighting a focus on attitude over superficial judgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Colvin later worked for another company Shein invested in, RangeMe, as a CTO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

Shein encourages young people to consider whether a degree is the "be-all and end-all" in the tech industry, noting that some of the best software developers are self-taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. He values attitude, being a team player, and the willingness to give 120% when required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

## Traits of Successful Founders for OIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>
OIF, Shein's venture capital fund, has a "founder-lead" thematic, meaning they focus on the founder first and then the industry or opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. Shein looks for specific qualities in founders:
*   **Ability to Energize People:** Founders must be able to convince others, such as a CTO, to leave secure jobs and join a startup with no customers or office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. They also need to persuade early customers to take a chance on their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
*   **High Energy:** Running a startup requires immense energy to navigate challenges like pandemics, talent attraction and retention issues, and shifts in capital availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **Edge to Make Tough Decisions:** Founders need the decisiveness to make difficult choices, such as letting go of a top salesperson who doesn't align with company values, or discontinuing a product that distracts from the core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.
*   **Execution Capability:** Ultimately, Shein assesses whether a founder can actually [[execution_and_leadership_in_startups | execute]] on the business plan they present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.

He believes that the current generation of founders, who have navigated through tough times like the pandemic and fluctuating capital markets, will be among the best due to the resilience they have built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. These challenges foster invaluable learning that cannot be taught in a business school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

## Investing in People <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>
Shein realized early in his career at Comtech that investing in people leads to exceptional customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Comtech maintained a 70% market share in a competitive environment by consistently delivering excellent customer service and fostering the best technical team in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. This was achieved by focusing on solving customer problems and having an "energized team of people" with both ability and the right attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. He stresses that integrity – doing what you say you will do – is paramount in building customer confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

At OIF, the first "F" in their three-F philosophy (Founder, Fund, Fun) signifies their 120% commitment to their founders, whom they view as customers. They strive to add value beyond merely providing capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. Their strategy is to back founders they want to work with and allow those founders to lead them into fast-growing industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.

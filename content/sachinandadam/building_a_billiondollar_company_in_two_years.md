Zella, a fintech company founded by Ben Fisa, achieved a valuation of a billion dollars in just two years, becoming the fastest-growing startup in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This remarkable feat was driven by a relentless focus on speed, execution, a clear vision, and a direct company culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## The Genesis of Zella

Ben Fisa's background in large, bureaucratic financial institutions like NAB and Visa provided him with key insights into the inefficiencies and problems within the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. He observed that existing products were very basic, lacking intelligence to help optimize financial positions for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. His experience at Square, a high-growth tech startup, showed him the potential for disruption and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. These combined learnings from both bureaucratic and high-growth environments were crucial in shaping Zella's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

The core idea for Zella emerged from the fundamental needs of businesses:
*   A business transaction account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>
*   The ability to accept electronic payments <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>
*   The means to spend and put money to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>

Zella aimed to integrate these three core functions – taking money, holding money, and spending money – into a single, simplified offering, providing better pricing, no lock-in contracts, and a superior technological experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. While simple in concept, executing this was incredibly hard, requiring the development of three massive fintechs in one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. The company chose to build its own infrastructure and products, minimizing reliance on third parties to maintain its desired pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

Zella's ability to acquire "tens of thousands of customers within just 2 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> was a direct result of its strategic approach:

*   **Velocity in Building:** The core principle was to avoid moving slowly, fostering a "wartime mentality" across all departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.
*   **Shotgun Approach:** Zella went broad rather than narrow in its go-to-market strategy, believing that a wider reach would prevent stagnation if initial assumptions were wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.
*   **Direct Channel & Partnerships:** The company focused on owning its direct channel but also partnered with retailers like Officeworks, which provided a significant halo effect for their launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.
*   **Experienced Team:** The initial team possessed significant prior experience in various organizations and sectors, enabling them to execute marketing and media strategies effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   **Vision-Driven Product Development:** Instead of asking customers what they wanted, Zella built based on its clear vision, trusting that they could "pivot quickly" if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. This stripped out bureaucracy and overthinking, allowing for rapid execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **Stable and Professional Product:** Recognizing the importance of trust when dealing with people's money, Zella ensured its product was "amazingly stable" and professional from day one, not cutting corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. The brand was made to "look bigger than it was" through design and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>.
*   **Brand Awareness:** The unique design of Zella's terminals and branded cards contributed to widespread visibility, creating a strong brand awareness even among casual observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. This visual presence helped reinforce advertising efforts for potential business customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

In the first month of operation, Zella signed up 1,500 businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Company Culture: Directness and Drive

Ben Fisa describes his approach to company culture as "contrarian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. He believes that culture cannot be fabricated with "neon lights" and mottos, but rather emerges organically from the amalgamation of personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. His personal experiences of disliking work at bureaucratic companies informed Zella's anti-bureaucratic stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

Key aspects of Zella's culture:
*   **Transparency and Directness:** Being upfront about expectations and operations, rather than pretending to be something they are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. This directness, rooted in Ben's "German combined with Australian background," allows for quick decision-making and problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **High Expectations and Hard Work:** The challenging nature of building a financial services product necessitates working "ridiculously hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. There is a clear expectation that employees will give their all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.
*   **Support and Fair Treatment:** While demanding, the company promises support for employees, offering breaks and time off when needed, especially for those giving their maximum effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.
*   **Focus on Execution and Speed:** Ben actively discourages time-wasting activities like excessive one-on-one meetings or over-planning with detailed Gantt charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. He encourages immediate problem-solving and constant pushing for faster delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.
*   **Hiring Alignment:** In interviews, Ben "reverse pitches" candidates, openly discussing the intensity and demanding nature of the culture to ensure alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This ensures that new hires are not surprised and are inspired by the fast-paced, talented environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   **Founding Team Harmony:** The four co-founders of Zella, despite being "completely different people," have never had an argument and are deeply aligned on their vision and work ethic, complementing each other's strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. They view early hires as "Founders" as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

> [!TIP] Operationalizing Speed
> To foster a culture of speed, Ben Fisa suggests:
> *   Eliminate bureaucracy: "Every little bit of saving or or Expediting a process or stripping out bureaucracy every little thing is going to add up to a lot of things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.
> *   Question timelines: "When someone says I can deliver by this day you say well how do we do it faster?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>
> *   Encourage direct communication: Instead of scheduling meetings, "walk up to my desk and ask me now let's solve it right here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.
> *   Avoid over-planning: Do not "spend 3 months building a gap chart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>; focus on execution and adjust quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

## [[Challenges and experiences of founding multibillion dollar companies | Overcoming Obstacles and Doubts]]

Despite the rapid success, the journey was not without its low points and moments of doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. Ben Fisa learned resilience from previous taxing experiences, such as setting up Square in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.

One major challenge occurred shortly after Zella raised its initial funds: the onset of COVID-19 lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. This was particularly alarming because Zella's business model was predicated on face-to-face transactions and digital banking, and there was widespread belief that physical commerce was disappearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. However, Zella's leadership believed that humans would return to face-to-face interactions and that "Co will come and go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>, and they continued to push forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

The night before launch was another moment of intense nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Having convinced investors and hires of their vision, the impending launch meant their beliefs would be measured by sales and onboards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. Fortunately, in the first month, 1,500 businesses signed up, alleviating the doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.

## Zella for Startups and Future Vision

Zella recently launched "Zella for Startups," an initiative addressing the frustrations that startups face with traditional banking services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. Ben Fisa experienced these frustrations himself, noting the absurd, weeks-long process of opening a bank account, including the need for faxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>. He highlights that despite entrepreneurship being the future of Australia, the startup community is "treated like crap" by incumbent financial institutions due to their perceived high risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>.

Zella for Startups aims to provide tailored features and functionalities, seeking feedback from the startup community in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>. This includes features like customizable account access for different team members or even investors, eliminating the need for constant financial reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.

The long-term vision for Zella's financial services is a system where individuals and businesses "shouldn't have to touch your money at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. Money would be automatically categorized, settled, transferred to optimal accounts, and used to pay bills or taxes without manual intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. With the rise of AI, Zella aims to predict a business's financial life stages, providing proactive support and insights to help with growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. This approach aims to relieve the burden on business owners by predicting their financial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.

## The Entrepreneurial Journey: A Never-Ending Horizon

Ben Fisa emphasizes that the entrepreneurial journey "never stops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>. He refers to it as the "Horizon Theory," where one continuously chases a goal without ever truly reaching an end state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>. Even achieving Unicorn status (a billion-dollar valuation) early on was merely "noise on the outside," as the company was still internally focused on [[building a successful tech startup | building]] and launching, with years of development ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Continuous Push
> "If you stop and feel like you've reached some form of end state or success or you've done what you w done you will get overtaken immediately" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>.

This culture of constant pushing, moving to the next feature, and never being satisfied with what has been built is what differentiates Zella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>. While not for everyone, it attracts individuals who thrive on continuous innovation and challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.

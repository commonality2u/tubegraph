Ben Thompson, founder of Employment Hero, shares his journey and insights on [[building_a_billiondollar_software_company | scaling a company from zero to over one billion dollars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. He has always aspired to [[building_a_billiondollar_software_company | build a big technology company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, inspired by figures like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## The Genesis of Employment Hero

Thompson's entrepreneurial journey began early, from selling citrus fruit as a child to running a recruitment agency in university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. After working as an employment lawyer, he realized a systemic problem: small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) found being an employer difficult and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This anxiety among SMBs, who account for 99% of businesses and 70% of all jobs globally, created a "massive handbrake on the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

Recognizing that 95% of employment processes (recruitment, onboarding, payroll, performance management) are the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, he sought to streamline them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This led to the creation of Employment Innovations, a services business acting as an HR back office for SMBs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Inspired by the article "Why Software Will Eat the World," Thompson decided to digitize the services business, leading to the development of Employment Hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## Challenges in Scaling to a Unicorn

Thompson notes that [[challenges_and_experiences_of_founding_multibillion_dollar_companies | scaling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> a company like Employment Hero involved significant hurdles:

*   **Product-Market Fit**: The initial challenge was to find product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   **Customer Focus**: Early on, a mistake was made by hiring enterprise salespeople who focused on large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This led to the development roadmap being dictated by a few large customers, moving the product away from its intended purpose for SMBs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. A difficult decision was made to inform these large customers that their instructions would no longer be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **[[bootstrapping_a_tech_company | Bootstrapping]] Capital Constraints**: Thompson initially [[bootstrapping_a_tech_company | bootstrapped]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a> Employment Hero using profits from his other businesses, Employment Innovations and Power to Motivate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. He learned that a Software as a Service (SaaS) startup requires significant capital, as customer acquisition costs are paid upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This led to needing to raise capital through venture debt and Series A funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.
*   **Constant Threat of Bankruptcy**: Thompson faced the constant threat of the business winding up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. He recalls a "darkest hour" when the company had only $27,000 against a $50,000 payroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. His motivation to keep going stems from the belief that "if you don't get through, you don't get anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>, echoing Churchill's advice to "keep going" when going through hell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

## Key Learnings for Building a Successful Company

Thompson believes that his journey from a small "lego set" to a larger, more sophisticated one has been a "one long continuum of skills and building" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. He would not do anything differently if he were to start over, as he has no regrets and embraces the ups and downs of business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

### Entrepreneurial Qualities

*   **Vision**: A key quality for a leader is having a clear vision for the product, knowing what you're [[building_a_successful_tech_startup | building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a> and why it works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. This includes being able to identify a product that people will buy, that can be built, and that has sufficient market demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>.
*   **Resilience**: Being prepared for constant challenges and "fires" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a> is crucial. Founders and SMB owners constantly face "ditches" and "hills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

## Navigating Current Market Conditions

Thompson advises on current macroeconomic shifts impacting startups:

*   **Capital Availability**: Rising interest rates cause money to flow out of speculative technology stocks and back into safer bonds, leading to less capital available for startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>.
*   **Higher Quality Bar**: The quality of companies that can raise capital is now much higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>.
*   **Unit Economics**: Obsession with unit economics is critical for survival. Employment Hero's strong unit economics allow it to break even if growth is slowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>.
*   **Tough Decisions**: For startups with limited runway and poor unit economics, pivoting, making "hard conversations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>, and laying people off may be necessary. The advice is to "cut hard and cut early" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.
*   **Optimism**: Despite the challenges, Thompson maintains optimism. He notes that if a recession hits, interest rates might come down, potentially stimulating the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. He also points out Australia's history of avoiding recessions while the US is in one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

Thompson distinguishes the current market from the dot-com crash:
> "The dot-com crash was just exuberance, it was like a new drug... This is driven by by clearly by macroeconomic forces, it's not that SaaS and technology doesn't work... it's just that when interest rates go up pension funds who supply the funds to VCs move their move their bets around the table to to safer positions and and other alternative positions and then the market doesn't have as much money to spend on these things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.

## Advice for Young Entrepreneurs and Startup Employees

*   **Conviction and Passion**: For young people considering entrepreneurship, it's essential to work on an idea based on "first principles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>. If you have absolute conviction and passion for an idea, "go for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, as it will build experience and "scar tissue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>. Without passion, it's hard to get through tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.
*   **Understand Liquidation Preferences**: When joining a startup, especially one that has raised significant capital, ask about "liquidation preference rights" and the "waterfall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>. A high headline valuation doesn't guarantee equity value for employees if investors have priority in getting their money back upon liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>.
*   **Be Prepared for Downsides**: Understand that being in a startup means being in business, which includes ups and downs, including potential down rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. Don't join if you're not prepared for this reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.
*   **Ask About Metrics**: When applying for a job at a startup, ask about their unit economics, burn multiple, growth rate, gross margin, and return on customer acquisition cost (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>. Aim to join companies in the "excellent" bracket of these metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.
*   **Profits Matter**: The market is shifting from solely focusing on revenue to valuing profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>.

## The Future of Work and Remote Models

Thompson is a strong proponent of remote work:

*   **Employee Demand**: Surveys by Employment Hero in 2020 and 2021 showed that 92-94% of employees expect the flexibility to work remotely at least one day a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.
*   **Access to Talent**: Remote work allows businesses to recruit from a global talent pool of billions, rather than a limited local radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.
*   **Social and Moral Benefits**: Remote work supports working parents, enables people in rural areas to participate in the global economy, and, with global internet access, can lift billions out of poverty by allowing them to contribute online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.
*   **Critique of Office Model**: Thompson likens traditional office buildings to "chicken coops," forcing people into unnatural environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. He believes remote work is healthier and more balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Approach**: While acknowledging challenges for young talent learning and social interaction in fully remote environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>, he advocates for a hybrid model where remote work is used when it makes sense, and teams gather for learning and social cohesion when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.

Thompson even suggests a startup idea for a "remote social" network to connect remote employees geographically for social events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

## Personal Interests and Philosophy

*   **Family**: Thompson is a husband and father of three, emphasizing his wife's role as the "boss at home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. His youngest son has special needs, making remote work essential for his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   **Hobbies**: He enjoys sailing and considers his business his hobby, spending a "ridiculous amount of time working on [his] hobby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, which feels like "playing with [his] legos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Reading**: His favorite book is "The Power of One" by Bryce Courtenay, which resonates with themes of fighting back against tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.
*   **Inspiration**: He is deeply inspired by space exploration and projects like SpaceX's Starship, seeing the construction of something never done before as incredibly inspiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>.
*   **Yacht Name**: His yacht is named "Alliance," mirroring his group of companies (Employment Hero, Power to Motivate, Key Pay, Employment Innovations), which he calls "the alliance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.

Sam Wong is a partner at Blackbird Ventures, one of the largest and earliest venture firms in Australia, offering her unique insights into [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_australian_tech_ecosystem | Australia's tech ecosystem]] and [[investing_in_startups_and_earlystage_companies | venture capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>. Blackbird Ventures is known for its mantra of investing in "wild hearts with the wildest of ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:51">[05:08:51]</a>.

## The Role of a Venture Capitalist (VC)
For Sam Wong, being a VC means discovering people with a unique insight and magic who are brave enough to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:16">[05:29:16]</a>. It involves joining them on their journey as a partner, maintaining humility, and recognizing that the company is theirs, not the investor's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:54">[05:53:54]</a>. The goal is to surround founders with data to help them make informed decisions and allow them to learn from their own experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:18">[06:17:18]</a>. At the early stage, [[investing_in_startups_and_earlystage_companies | VCs invest in people]] because companies are built by individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:19">[06:54:19]</a>.

> "The best VCs are people that bring their whole personality into work. They are in that industry because they're curious and they love building." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:01">[03:55:01]</a>

### Integrating Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations, specifically Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns, are a critical part of Blackbird's investment decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:01">[08:42:01]</a>. After a founder pitches, partners complete a Google Form with cameras off to avoid bias, assessing areas like team, market, distribution, and any ESG concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:50">[08:48:50]</a>. This process triggers early conversations with founders about how their technology might accelerate both negative and positive societal outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:25">[09:25:25]</a>. Sam Wong has found that 99% of these conversations unlock more positive potential than negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:08">[09:43:08]</a>.

For healthcare AI companies like Harrison.ai, foundational knowledge in privacy and ethics is essential, reflecting how much the founder has considered the impact of their "life's work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:08">[11:11:08]</a>.

## Identifying Promising Startups and Founders
Sam Wong looks for several key signals when [[investing_in_startups_and_earlystage_companies | investing in early-stage companies]]:

*   **Velocity or Extraordinary Progress** Startups are designed to grow fast, so VCs look for significant output with very limited resources, as startups rarely have enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. This often manifests as an impatience in the founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Harrison.ai's technical founder, Angus, built and sold an IVF embryo detection AI product within three to four months while completing his medical degree, demonstrating extreme velocity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:02">[16:01:02]</a>.
*   **Ability to Magnetize Talent** Great founders can attract talent they "probably have no right to have" at that stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:07">[14:07:07]</a>. In the beginning, founders sell an idea, vision, and narrative to early employees and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>. Attracting amazing talent increases the probability of success, as this talent will do their life's work and attract more talent, creating a positive compounding effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.
*   **"Life's Work" of the Founder** This indicates deep understanding and commitment, helping to mitigate potential problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.

While pattern recognition is important, Sam Wong distinguishes it from bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:59">[18:09:59]</a>. Observing outliers—founders who achieve significantly more with the same resources—is a form of pattern recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>. However, it's crucial to be aware of the bias that can creep in when seeing many similar pitches, which requires active effort to quiet skepticism and look for unique, differentiated signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>. Often, there's a "weirdness" that makes a company stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>.

## Evolution of an Investor's Approach
Sam Wong's investing approach has changed over time:
*   **Avoiding Over-Enthusiasm:** Early on, it's easy to "fall in love" with ideas and wish to build them yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>. However, true success depends on many factors aligning, including the team, market readiness, and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>. Now, Sam actively tries to "quiet herself" and listen more, to avoid planting ideas or words in founders' mouths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>.
*   **Learning from Losses vs. Doubling Down on Winners:** A high loss rate is inherent to [[investing_in_startups_and_earlystage_companies | venture capital]] because it signifies taking significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:09">[22:07:09]</a>. The best performing funds often have higher loss rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:19:00">[22:19:00]</a>. While learnings are taken from failures, it's equally important to double down on winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43:00">[22:43:00]</a>.
*   **Beyond Grit:** While hustle and grit are important for avoiding zero outcomes, they don't guarantee 100x outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>. Spectacular success also depends on luck, the market, and the ability to attract the right team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>.

## Current Thematic Interests
Sam Wong's thematic interests are increasingly guided by where high-quality founders are directing their efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:26:00">[28:26:00]</a>.

*   **AgTech and Future of Food:** Initially underestimated how quickly the market would react and become competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>. For deep tech, building a global profile is crucial to attract the necessary capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>. Enabling technologies in this space are more interesting if they can serve more than just the food sector (e.g., high-value compounds, fertilizers, food ingredients) due to uncertain product timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24:00">[26:24:00]</a>.
*   **Designing for Neurodiverse Experiences:** Interested in how software experiences, particularly work-based ones, can be designed with neurodiverse conditions (e.g., ADHD, autism) in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:56:00">[28:56:00]</a>. This approach can help not only neurodiverse individuals but also the broader population suffering from increasing distractibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31:00">[29:31:00]</a>. In SaaS, the focus has shifted from paper-to-digital to 10x-ing already digital experiences, making user experience (UX) design for productivity crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:51:00">[29:51:00]</a>.
*   **"Markets as a Service":** How technology enables markets to form and operate where they were previously uneconomical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:02:00">[31:02:00]</a>. This includes creating efficient "rails" to connect financing to specific activities (e.g., green bonds for low-carbon transitions, vocational reskilling) where traditional banking or paper-based systems are inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>. This is about the mechanics of pulling people into a market, not solely blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:11:00">[33:11:00]</a>.
*   **Deeper into Biology (beyond healthcare):** Exploring high-value materials and other biological applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:24:00">[33:24:00]</a>.
*   **"Laggard Commerce":** Bringing goods and services that are currently not truly digital online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:35:00">[33:35:00]</a>.
    *   *Example:* A New Zealand company bringing 70% of offline auto parts commerce online in a two-trillion-dollar industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:00">[33:55:00]</a>.

Sam notes that for seed-stage [[investing_in_startups_and_earlystage_companies | investors]], focusing on trends is often "too late" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:31:00">[37:31:00]</a>. The focus is more on identifying singular, disruptive companies and entrepreneurial individuals who create new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>.

## Advice for Young People in Tech and Startups
With the rising tide of young people interested in [[innovation_in_australian_technology | Australian tech]] and startups, driven by successes like Canva and Atlassian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:57:00">[37:57:00]</a>:

*   **"Just Do Stuff":** Start building things at university, learn what you're interested in, and where you can add value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:20:00">[38:20:00]</a>.
*   **Make Relationships:** Connect with people who can offer "luck" for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:00">[38:31:00]</a>.
*   **Overcome Fear of Selling:** Ask customers for money, even before having a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:00">[38:43:00]</a>. This is the only way to know if you're building something of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:01:00">[39:01:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace "No":** Being told "no" is a gift for an early-stage founder, as it helps focus on who says "yes" quickly, even to an ugly product, and provides valuable feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:00">[39:53:00]</a>.
*   **Practice, Don't Just Theorize:** "There's no way to theory your way into startups or even theory your way into investing. You've just got to do it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:06:00">[39:06:00]</a> This includes writing small checks or building small projects and asking people to pay for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:00">[39:13:00]</a>.

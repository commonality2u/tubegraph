Raising capital is a critical phase for startups, fraught with challenges but also offering immense rewards. Liam Milwood, founder of Instant, shares insights from his company's rapid fundraising journey, highlighting strategies for success and the psychological toll it can take.

## The Fast Pace of Fundraising
Instant, a company founded by Liam Milwood at age 17, demonstrated exceptional speed in its capital raising efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. They managed to raise $18 million in just 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This rapid fundraising was part of Instant's ambition to be the "best, fastest growing company in Australia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The entire process, from the first conversation with an investor to having money in the bank, took approximately 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Strategic Approach to Fundraising
Milwood emphasizes a strategic approach to securing investment:
*   **Raise When Not Desperate** One key strategy is to raise capital when it's not strictly necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Instant had $2 million in the bank and was growing quickly, but chose to raise more to enable continued aggressive growth rather than aiming for profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Timing for Urgency** Raising capital at the end of the year creates natural pressure on investors to move quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Milwood notes that "end of year funding rounds move so quick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Creating Urgency and Competition**
    *   **Investor Updates as Pitch Decks** Instant never had a traditional pitch deck during their Series A round. Instead, they sent out their regular investor updates, which implicitly served as pitch materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
    *   **Fictional Term Sheets** To create urgency, Instant would sometimes claim to have term sheets already, even if they were still forthcoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This strategic move is "beneficial for the company to get a funding round over and done with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## The Investor's Perspective: Hummingbird's Diligence
Hummingbird, a key investor in Instant's Series A, is known for being an "incredibly hard fund to get funding from" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Their due diligence process goes beyond standard financial metrics:
*   **Focus on the Founder** Hummingbird primarily "digs into the founder as a person," assessing who they are, how they think, and their core drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Assessing Momentum and Drive** Investors like Hummingbird are looking for evidence that the founder will drive momentum for the business, considering aspects like hiring decisions, product strategy, competitor awareness, and future goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Milwood believes that "momentum solves every issue in every company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Persistence Pays Off** One investor from Hummingbird emailed Liam 26 times over two years before receiving a response, demonstrating extreme persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The partner even flew from London to Sydney to meet in person, solidifying the deal quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Challenges and Mental Fortitude
Raising capital is not without its difficulties:
*   **Rejection and Burnout** Milwood acknowledges that fundraising "burns the founders out" and can be "super depressing" due to consistent rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. He faced rejections from investors and programs like Startmate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.
*   **Proving People Wrong** A significant driver for Milwood is proving wrong those who doubted him, including former employees, rejecting investors, and competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. This extends to proving right those who believed in him, such as his parents and early employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
*   **Managing Psychological Stress** To cope with the pressure, Milwood relied on exercising, having positive people around him, and going home to Brisbane on weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of a tight, trusting core leadership team (like his co-founder Will and COO Brandon) where "we don't sugarcoat anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.

## Growth and Revenue as the Ultimate Goal
For Instant, an unwavering focus on revenue became the North Star:
*   **Revenue Obsession** The company became "heavily focused on revenue as a business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Milwood states that "revenue obsession and speed are our two values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
*   **Product-Market Fit** They measured product-market fit through "zero customer churn and revenue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Gamified Goals** To motivate the team, they set a clear goal of reaching $1 million in revenue, internally calling it "million dollars to Hoola" with the promise of a trip to Hawaii (though they celebrated with a big party in Sydney instead) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. They achieved this in six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
*   **Funding Global Expansion** Instant is using its impressive growth in Australia to fund its expansion into the US market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. This highlights the importance of strong initial growth as a foundation for future ambitious endeavors.

## Conclusion
Liam Milwood's journey with Instant underscores that successful capital raising involves not only securing funds but also strategically managing the process with urgency, cultivating strong investor relationships, and maintaining an intense focus on business fundamentals, particularly revenue generation and growth.

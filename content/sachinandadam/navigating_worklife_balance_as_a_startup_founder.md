Georgia Vidler, co-founder of Human Health, shares her insights and experiences on [[the_balance_of_work_and_personal_life_for_entrepreneurs | balancing work and personal life]], especially as a startup founder. She emphasizes a health-first approach, drawing from past experiences with burnout and her company's core mission.

## Early Career and Lessons Learned
In her 20s, Vidler admits to having "churned," working "all night [and] weekends," which led to burnout [00:16:30]. This intense work was fueled by finding something she truly loved and a desire to achieve self-actualization, combined with perfectionism [00:17:23]. She found herself in a "flow" state, often forgetting to eat or drink, completely immersed in her work [00:17:39].

## Human Health's Approach to Well-being
As a co-founder of Human Health, an app that tracks treatments and symptoms for chronic diagnoses [00:00:37], Vidler and her co-founder Kate prioritize healthy habits within their company culture. They believe it would be "freaking ironic" if a health company promoted unhealthy practices [00:16:43]. Their philosophy is clear: if they "had to kill [themselves], sacrifice [their] family, sacrifice [their] relationship, sacrifice [their] health to make this succeed, it's not worth it" [00:17:07].

## Finding Flow and Understanding Limits
Vidler views the intensity of startup life as a "pendulum," where some level of deep immersion is beneficial, but too much can lead to neglecting personal life and well-being [00:18:12]. She now understands her limits, sometimes starting her workday later to prioritize a walk and coffee [00:19:20]. Recognizing that "there's not one perfect week that should work for everybody," she advocates for finding what works individually [00:19:35].

## The Debate: Obsession vs. Balance
There's a cultural conversation that is "almost anti obsession and anti working extreme long hours" [00:19:03]. However, Vidler notes that many "great Founders" are deeply passionate and want to work hard towards their mission [00:19:10]. Her personal philosophy leans towards "obsession with a tiny bit of balance" [00:59:25].

## Strategies for Maintaining Balance
*   **Breaks:** Vidler and Kate recently took a five-night trip, realizing that "the sky will not fall if you take five nights away from the team" [00:51:27]. She highly recommends taking breaks [00:51:37].
*   **Accepting Outcomes:** She has learned to accept any potential outcome for Human Health, which has brought her peace [00:52:17]. By surrendering the need to control every outcome, she feels less stressed and more creative, operating with a "sky is the limit" mindset [00:53:20].
*   **Self-Awareness:** Recognizing when she deviates from her naturally optimistic state is a signal to "take stock" and "take a minute" [00:57:07]. She often retreats to places like the Blue Mountains for peace and perspective, finding that her problems seem less daunting when faced with millions-of-years-old mountains [00:55:11].
*   **Prioritizing Personal Well-being:** While acknowledging the desire to bring joy at scale through Human Health, she recognizes that neglecting "micro" interactions with friends and family leads to an "unbalanced" state [00:56:31]. Maintaining personal relationships and activities (like exercise) is crucial for a sense of self and overall well-being [00:57:58].

Ultimately, Vidler strives for a state of "joyful and optimistic," viewing it as her "healthy State" [00:57:25]. She believes that [[balancing_work_life_and_personal_wellbeing | integrating balance and integrity]] into a founder's life is as important as the company's mission [01:00:00].

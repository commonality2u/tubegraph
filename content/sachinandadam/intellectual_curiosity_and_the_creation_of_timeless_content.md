Nick Crocker, a partner at Blackbird and a three-time exited founder, is recognized for his [[curiosity_and_learning | intellectual curiosity]] across various domains, including love, travel, and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This curiosity deeply influences his approach to content creation, particularly his "Branches" newsletter, which aims to share "timelessly good" material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## The "Branches" Newsletter: Sharing the Timeless
The core purpose of the "Branches" newsletter is to share content that Nick believes will be considered "timelessly good" even in 10 or 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. He writes the newsletter for himself, sharing things he genuinely loves and would read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Inspiration for Content
Content for "Branches" is often chosen when a piece creates a strong internal "frustration," a feeling that he "have to tell someone about this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This occurs when he encounters something that moves him deeply, such as:
*   **Music**: Fred Again's Boiler Room set, which he considers "musical genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. He notes that Fred Again is a rare artist he's discovered in his late 30s, defying the scientific tendency to only find favorite artists in one's teens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Performance**: Derek DelGaudio's live performance, "In & Of Itself," which "absolutely blew [his] mind" and brought him to tears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Art**: Sydney Nolan's "Riverbend," a painting that deeply affected him with its emotional depth, prompting him to sit before it for half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This connection to art is a personal hallmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Nick's process involves collecting these moving experiences—be it a mix, an article, or an artwork—until he has a collection of three or four things he "have to tell people about," which then form an edition of "Branches" structured into a narrative flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Roots of Curiosity and Aesthetic Appreciation
Nick's profound [[curiosity_and_learning | curiosity]] and appreciation for aesthetics seem to have deep roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. His father was a woodworker who made fine furniture, instilling in Nick a passion for craft and its output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Personality tests consistently rank him at the top for his care for aesthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This extends to "great music, great furniture, timeless art" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. He recognizes that this deep emotional connection means he feels "highs and lows more than other people," requiring more effort to maintain mental well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Early Content Creation and Learning
Nick's early career demonstrates a consistent drive to learn and share. While working a "miserable" government job, he sought to connect with inspirational people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. He pursued journalism, pitching a column to the *Sunday Mail* daily for three months until he was granted the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This role allowed him to interview a wide array of individuals—politicians, puppeteers, jewelers, athletes—to understand their paths and discover his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

Later, as a first employee of a startup helping independent artists, with a meager marketing budget of $250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>, he embraced a "scrappy and resourceful" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. He created a free PDF guide on "how to market your music online," which resonated widely with both artists and record labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. This experience of shipping something that "connects with thousands of people at once" was a "credible rush" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>, reinforcing his drive for creating valuable, resonant content.

## Enduring Value and Personal Growth
Despite his personal startups not achieving "enduring" success or lasting more than three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>, Nick emphasizes that true "success is building something enduring and then something that you can pass on to someone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. His work at Blackbird, which he describes as the "most successful thing I've ever been a part of," aligns with this principle of [[pursuing_quality_and_taste_in_creative_work | enduring value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.

His journey illustrates that deep [[curiosity_and_learning | intellectual curiosity]], combined with a strong appreciation for aesthetics and a drive to understand and connect with people, forms the bedrock for creating and identifying content and ventures with the potential for timeless appeal and significant impact.

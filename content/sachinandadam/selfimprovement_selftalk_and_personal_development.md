Fred Schebesta, founder of Finder and author of "Go Live," is described as a true visionary who sees the world uniquely and can anticipate trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. His approach to life is rooted in deep [[selfdevelopment_and_selfawareness | self-awareness]] and a continuous drive for [[personal_growth_and_selfawareness | personal growth]] and improvement.

## Guiding Principles for a Visionary Life

Schebesta's personal philosophy emphasizes curiosity, risk-taking, and forward-thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

*   **Curiosity and Risk-Taking**: From a young age, Schebesta demonstrated intense curiosity, exemplified by disassembling an electric clock to understand how it worked, even cutting live wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. This act highlights his willingness to "cut cables, take chances, take risks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
*   **Future-Oriented Mindset**: He primarily lives in the future, focusing on how to advance and discover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. He looks for patterns and "programmed human behaviors," observing movements of people at the "edges of humanity" to identify new trends and adoptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   **"Memento Mori"**: A core principle is "memento mori," a Roman practice where a general was reminded of their mortality, meaning "one day you will die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. This principle encourages making decisions by contemplating one's "funeral speech" and working backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing Energy and Flow**: Schebesta makes changes when he realizes he's not in his "highest energy space" or "in flow," even if it comes at a cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. This ensures his contribution remains significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

## Authenticity and Purpose

Schebesta's journey reflects a commitment to living authentically, driven by his passions.

*   **Overcoming the "Fraud" Feeling**: In his youth, he felt like a "fraud" due to conforming to societal expectations and pursuing paths he wasn't genuinely interested in, particularly during his time at a "very conformist school" and university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. This experience taught him to stop doing things he didn't enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.
*   **Focusing on Passions**: He actively avoids tasks he dislikes, such as cleaning clothes, going to supermarkets, or washing dishes, believing he can contribute more by focusing on what he loves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. He will "defend and do anything" for the things he is passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.
*   **Household as a Business**: Schebesta views household management as a business, similar to managing a company with departments like laundry, food, finance, and HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>. This perspective encourages an "enterprising" approach to problems, focusing on creative solutions rather than viewing tasks as burdens on personal identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>.
*   **Inventing a Purpose**: For those seeking purpose, he advises simply to "make one up" that "stretches you outside your comfort zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:03:00">[53:03:00]</a>. This self-defined purpose provides direction, velocity, and acceleration, helping to navigate challenges and aspire to something greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:56:00">[51:56:00]</a>.

## Addressing Self-Limiting Beliefs and Negative Self-Talk

Schebesta emphasizes the profound impact of internal dialogue on [[selfdevelopment_and_selfawareness | self-awareness]] and [[changing_beliefs_and_personal_growth | personal growth]].

*   **The Root of Unworthiness**: The feeling of "not being good enough" or "not being worthy" often stems from self-judgment, which can "drown out" genuine feelings of accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:51:00">[54:51:00]</a>.
*   **Listening to Internal Language**: The first step to [[managing_selfdoubt_and_impostor_syndrome | overcoming self-limiting beliefs]] is to "hear yourself and the language you use" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:43:00">[56:43:00]</a>.
    *   **Contrast**: Compare your internal self-talk when you make a mistake to how you would speak to a child learning to walk—with encouragement and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:05:00">[57:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Identify Negative Dialogue**: Recognize harsh self-criticism ("you're so stupid," "you didn't deserve that") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:27:00">[57:27:00]</a>. This dialogue is internal; "no one else said that, no one else in the room is thinking that except you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:53:00">[57:53:00]</a>.
    *   **Unpack Emotional Reactions**: When experiencing extreme emotions like anger, annoyance, or sadness, write them down and "unpack that" by asking why you feel that way and "what am I judging about myself that's actually causing that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:25:00">[58:25:00]</a>. Understanding that "you create your own feelings" is crucial for [[the_role_of_values_and_self_reflection_in_personal_and_business_growth | self-reflection]] and [[personal_and_professional_growth_through_coaching | personal growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:51:00">[58:51:00]</a>.
*   **The Path Forward**: By addressing these self-limiting beliefs, individuals can pay down their "debt" of self-doubt and feel amazing while continuing to strive for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:50:00">[55:50:00]</a>.

## Embracing Continuous Growth and Learning

Schebesta advocates for constant progress and a willingness to step outside one's comfort zone, tying into [[the_influence_of_environment_on_personal_change | the influence of environment on personal change]].

*   **The 2% Rule**: Even when winning or excelling, remember that you "probably only know about two percent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:26:00">[51:26:00]</a>. This mindset encourages humility and continuous exploration.
*   **Leaving the "Small Pond"**: To grow, it's essential to "go and leave the pond" where you are a "big fish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:36:00">[51:36:00]</a>. This means embracing being a beginner and accepting that you will make mistakes, as he currently does in NFTs and gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:36:00">[36:36:00]</a>.
*   **Leaning into Discomfort**: Anytime your mind feels a "mild amount of challenge," Schebesta suggests leaning into it and getting "really uncomfortable as quickly as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:40:00">[35:40:00]</a>. This approach drives deeper understanding and allows one to get "very early into" new areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:52:00">[36:52:00]</a>.
*   **Identifying Opportunities**: Pay close attention to "tiny little variations and bumps of people's lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:37:00">[34:37:00]</a>. When someone shares something that excites them or is "remarkable"—outside the "standard deviation of normal"—that is the moment to focus and pay attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:07:00">[37:07:00]</a>.

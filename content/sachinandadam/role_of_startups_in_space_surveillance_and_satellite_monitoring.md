The modern [[the_new_space_race_and_global_satellite_boom | space race]] involves a dramatic increase in the number of satellites in orbit and increased monitoring of activities in space by different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This environment has created a critical role for companies that can provide [[challenges_and_technologies_in_space_imaging | space imaging]] and surveillance services.

## Heo: An Australian Startup's Contribution

Heo is an Australian [[launching_a_startup | startup]] playing a critical role in helping Western allies in the [[the_new_space_race_and_global_satellite_boom | new space race]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The company manufactures cameras and sensors for satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, enabling governments and companies to monitor activities in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Mission and Purpose
Heo's mission is to "make space transparent" and to be able to image anything in the solar system on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This transparency is crucial because a lack of it can be exploited by malicious actors, leading to conflict on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Increased monitoring also helps maintain the spatial resource of Earth's orbit, ensuring satellites are working as intended and addressing non-operational or derelict objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

### Services and Technology
Heo primarily offers a subscription to its software, providing analytics and data pulled from its sensors in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. They also build their own sensors and provide them to other companies, either by selling them or owning and operating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

The company's core services include:
*   **Satellite Imaging:** Taking photos of satellites from other satellites as they pass close by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Identification of Issues:** Helping satellite operators identify issues on their satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Tracking Debris:** Tracking debris or satellites that have stopped operating, which is important for deorbiting and preventing incidents on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Data Analysis:** Utilizing complex software and [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_aidriven_startups | AI]] to hunt through data sets, find targeted satellites, enhance images, and provide insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. They optimize camera use and apply post-processing to improve image quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

Heo is unique in being both a hardware and software company, which provides a significant competitive advantage and makes them attractive to [[investing_in_startups_and_earlystage_companies | investors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Their cameras include the "Holmes" model, launched in June 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, and a larger telescope planned for launch in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Customers
Heo sells images and analytics to a range of commercial and government customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Their clientele includes the Australian Space Agency, UK Space Agency, and national security agencies in the US, Japan, Australia, and the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Origins and Market Position
Heo began as an asteroid mining company in 2016 but pivoted two years later to focus on imaging other satellites due to the larger market opportunity and transferable technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

The company was a first mover in non-earth imaging, unaware that US regulations had historically prevented other US companies from entering this specific market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Heo's activities in Australia actually triggered a change in US law about 18 months prior to the transcript, allowing other companies to enter the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. This first-mover advantage has been a significant benefit, as competitors are only now starting to release similar products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Heo now views this regulatory change as an opportunity to partner with US companies that were previously prohibited from this work, allowing them to integrate US sensors into their model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

### Challenges and Outlook
While the space arena is thriving with significant funding and tailwinds, the sensitive nature of the industry and its intertwining with government contracts mean that regulatory changes can have a large impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. However, Heo views increased competition as an opportunity to expand its partnerships and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. The company anticipates playing a huge role in making space more transparent in the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

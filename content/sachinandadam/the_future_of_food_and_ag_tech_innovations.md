Sam Wong, a partner at Blackbird Ventures, is deeply interested in [[the_future_of_technology_and_innovation_in_australia | technology]] that addresses global challenges, particularly in the realm of food and agriculture. She expresses a personal fascination with the future of food and a concern about feeding an additional 1.5 billion people by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Key Learnings in Ag Tech

Through her investments and observations in the ag tech space, Sam Wong has gained several key insights:

*   **Market Competitiveness** The market in various ag tech verticals has become competitive relatively quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.
*   **Global Profile for Deep Tech** For deep tech companies, especially those in ag tech, it's crucial to establish a global profile to attract necessary capital even before a product is ready to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. This helps ensure continuous funding required to bring products to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.
*   **Enabling Technologies** There's a realization that [[challenges_and_advancements_in_cultured_meat_technology | enabling technologies]] need to be created to support the "future food" path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **Broader Application Beyond Food** To mitigate the uncertainty of timelines for some future food products, these enabling technologies should ideally be applicable to more than just the food sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. For instance, such technologies can be valuable for high-value compounds, fertilizers, and other food ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure Needs** Many ag tech innovations also require significant infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Food Scarcity vs. Distribution
> Interviewer Sachin notes a quote suggesting that the world's issue isn't food scarcity but rather food distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. This perspective highlights the importance of innovations that address logistical and market-based challenges in food systems.

## Ethical Considerations and [[social_impact_and_innovation_in_emerging_technologies | Social Impact]]

Sam Wong emphasizes that [[social_impact_and_innovation_in_emerging_technologies | ethical considerations]] and [[the_impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | social impact]] are critical parts of Blackbird Ventures' investment decision-making process. These concerns are literally a part of their Google form assessment for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Discussions about how a technology might accelerate both negative and positive societal outcomes are held early with founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

She notes that in 99% of cases, early conversations about ethics have unlocked more positive potential than negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This includes thinking about [[the_future_of_technology_and_innovation_in_australia | technology]] and [[the_impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | AI]]'s role in future industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### "Markets as a Service" and Climate Change Finance

A particularly interesting area for Sam Wong is the concept of "markets as a service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>. This involves how [[the_impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | technology]] can enable markets to form and operate where they were previously uneconomical due to high costs or lack of transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

An example given is green bonds or climate change finance products designed to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. This involves financing small-scale, ground-level activities like farmers transitioning to regenerative agriculture or protecting waterways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. Traditional big banks are not set up for these smaller financing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>, creating an opportunity for new "rails" to efficiently connect large-scale investment capital with these activities, prove the work done, and verify climate change outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. This is seen as a new market that [[the_impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | technology]] can facilitate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.

## Broader Biology Beyond Healthcare

Beyond food, Sam Wong is interested in [[the_impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | innovations]] deeper into biology that are not strictly healthcare, such as high-value materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>.

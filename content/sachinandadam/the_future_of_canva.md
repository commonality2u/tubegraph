Canva's co-founder, Cam Adams, shared insights into the company's future directions and philosophical underpinnings during Climate Week in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Key Focus Areas for the Next Five Years

Canva is primarily focusing on two significant areas for its future growth:

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Canva views AI as crucial for expanding access to great design and enhancing people's ability to communicate their ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This builds on Canva's success in enabling communication over the past 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

### Teams and Enterprises
A growing number of users are leveraging Canva collaboratively within their teams to achieve larger goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Currently, 95% of the Fortune 500 companies utilize Canva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. The aim is to integrate Canva further into the enterprise space, positioning it as a central hub for entire creative workflows and visual communication needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

## Global Vision and Impact

Canva's founders established the company with a vision to create an organization that extends beyond mere profits and shareholder value, aiming to provide value to every person involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This foundational principle naturally leads to considering the planet and social equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

### Advice for Young Founders
Cam Adams advises young [[impact_of_canva_on_the_australian_startup_ecosystem | Australian Founders]] to "think big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. Canva itself did not initially consider Australia as its primary market, viewing it as potentially the fourth or fifth market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

Adams stresses that with current technology, geographic constraints are less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. He encourages entrepreneurs to tackle "world problems" that can be world-changing, thereby targeting an audience of billions rather than just 20 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. This philosophy underscores Canva's continued global expansion and its aspiration for widespread impact.

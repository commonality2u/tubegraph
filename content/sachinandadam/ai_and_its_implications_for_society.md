Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull emphasizes that the most important thing with innovation is attitude: being prepared to address a problem differently than how it was done before, rather than adhering to traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He highlights that the key to Australia's future success lies in innovation to drive productivity and competitiveness, noting the nation's "exciting and accelerating AI momentum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>.

## Innovation and Technological Progress in Australia
Turnbull acknowledges his reputation for technological knowledge, though he admits it was "way way way above reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:40">[07:55:40]</a>, partly due to many Members of Parliament struggling with smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. His fascination with newness and his inclination to "tinker and tweak" reflect his belief in constant review for better ways of doing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:47">[08:14:47]</a>.

### Government Initiatives and Impact
Turnbull is credited by figures in the startup community, such as David Shein (founder of Our Internet Future, OIF), for his significant impact on Australia's technology sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:07">[09:07:07]</a>. His government's National Innovation and Science Agenda (NISA) included approximately 24 measures, with major components being tax incentives and new innovation funds like the Medical Research Fund and Main Sequence Ventures (CSIRO fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:03">[09:36:03]</a>.

These initiatives had a "very big impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:07">[10:06:07]</a>, leading to a substantial increase in venture capital in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:47">[10:11:47]</a>. David Shein even suggests that Australia's startup sector is "as big or bigger than that of Israel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:03">[10:34:03]</a>, despite Australia's tendency to not "talk our own book enough" about its achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:47">[10:50:47]</a> and focus on its mining industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:42">[22:08:42]</a>.

### The Role of Government in Tech Development
Turnbull advocates for government departments to be active supporters and customers for Australian startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:20">[18:15:20]</a>, noting a tendency for government to prefer dealing with large companies due to risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:08">[18:26:08]</a>. He stresses that startups prefer contracts over grants, as contracts offer "validation" and provide valuable feedback and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:04">[18:46:04]</a>.

He highlights the critical importance of encouraging Australian technology, particularly in defense, which he describes as "very very conservative" and prone to buying foreign equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:02">[19:07:02]</a>. He links national security and sovereignty directly to Australia's ability to "build, design, maintain [and] sustain" technology domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:04">[20:47:04]</a>. An example of Australian technological success is Advanced Navigation, which developed world-leading inertial navigation technology, crucial for military and other applications without GPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:09">[23:20:09]</a>.

## Societal Implications of Technology and AI
Turnbull discusses the shift from traditional, curated media to a more "creator-led" world dominated by social networks and podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:55:54">[24:55:54]</a>.

### Challenges of the Digital Age
*   **Information Silos**: The feasibility of "narrowcasting" has led to people increasingly living in "information silos," where media, whether social or curated, becomes highly partisan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:09:47">[26:09:47]</a>. This means people are "no longer sharing the same facts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:20">[26:47:20]</a>, leading to hyper-partisanship and increased societal division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:27:07">[27:27:07]</a>.
*   **Riling Audiences**: Media platforms often prioritize "riling them up and making them angry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:44:06">[27:44:06]</a> to gain clicks and retain audiences, which Turnbull deems "very dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:47:22">[27:47:22]</a>.
*   **Deepfakes and Impersonation**: The rise of [[artificial_intelligence_and_existential_risks | AI]] and deepfakes poses "real challenges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:54:55">[30:54:55]</a>, especially the ability to create convincing voice or image facsimiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:02:00">[31:02:00]</a>. This could be used for financial fraud (e.g., calling a bank with a fake voice) or political disruption (e.g., a fake statement before an election) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:02">[31:14:02]</a>. Turnbull suggests that creating a plausible fake image, like the widely circulated fake photo of the Pope in a puffer jacket, demonstrates how such content cannot be "unseen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:51:00">[33:51:00]</a>.
*   **[[Controversial AI regulation and government response | AI Regulation]]**: Turnbull believes it will be necessary to make it a "serious crime to impersonate somebody online" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:33:14">[32:33:14]</a>, unless it is clearly for satire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:43:08">[32:43:08]</a>. He highlights the difficulty of regulating [[AI and advertising | AI]] given that technology is hard to hold back or ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:19:16">[34:19:16]</a>.
*   **[[Impact of AI on employment and the future of work | Impact on Employment]]**: Turnbull acknowledges that [[the_impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | AI]] will lead to "yet another layer of jobs" being replaced by technology, but notes that concerns about this have existed since the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:42:07">[34:42:07]</a>.

## Cultural Shift Towards Innovation and Risk-Taking
A significant challenge in politics is "risk aversion," where people are worried about "failing" and reluctant to admit when something isn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. In contrast, the tech sector's culture encourages "fail fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:17">[13:30:17]</a>. Turnbull openly stated in 2015 that he could guarantee "they won't all work" when introducing NISA measures, emphasizing that unsuccessful initiatives would be dropped, successful ones scaled, and effective policies from elsewhere shamelessly plagiarized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:07">[14:10:07]</a>.

### The Value of Failure
Turnbull argues that if every investment is successful, it implies a lack of sufficient risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>. He emphasizes that failure is seen as a learning opportunity in places like Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:07">[15:48:07]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a> "When something succeeds... everyone is so busy congratulating themselves that they don't look back, whereas there's a reason why there's a term postmortem. There's no such thing as a post-thear. So postmortem, something's fail and and you learn from that."

Professional investors often value individuals who have experienced "a few wipeouts" because they have learned significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. Turnbull believes that labeling failure as a "pejorative thing" can discourage people from trying at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:35:07">[36:35:07]</a>. He suggests that if people are afraid to fail, they won't try, which is detrimental to [[challenges_faced_by_ai_developers_regarding_safety_concerns | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:39:00">[36:39:00]</a>.

## Future Focus Areas for Australia
If Malcolm Turnbull were Prime Minister again, his top three focus areas would be:

1.  **Innovation and Australian Technology**: Ensuring Australian technology and industry are supported and advanced, noting that while the current government is making an effort, more needs to be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:14:02">[38:14:02]</a>.
2.  **Clean Energy Transition**: Achieving a zero-emission country status, leveraging Australia's potential in areas like pumped hydro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:43:08">[38:43:08]</a>.
3.  **National Unity**: Counteracting efforts to divide Australia, particularly by some politicians and media, and upholding Australia's success as a multicultural society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:04:09">[39:04:09]</a>. He criticizes media outlets that promote "angerment" and divide communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11:47">[40:11:47]</a>.

Turnbull advises media creators to prioritize "balance and telling the truth" and to "don't make stuff up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:00]</a>. He cites the Guardian's success in Australia as an example of a publication that maintains professional journalism by not fabricating stories, running vendettas, or entertaining conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:41:00">[28:41:00]</a>.

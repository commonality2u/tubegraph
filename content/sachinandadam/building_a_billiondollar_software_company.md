Employment Hero, founded and led by Ben Thompson, is a billion-dollar software company based in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. They specialize in creating software for HR, payroll, and related services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The company has navigated significant challenges in the tech market, particularly during a tough macroeconomic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Navigating Economic Downturns
Ben Thompson first discussed his experience navigating market changes in June 2022, at the beginning of the tech industry's market turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The company entered this period with a hypersensitive focus on unit economics, a practice instilled by John Henderson from Airwallex during their Series A and B funding rounds eight years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This early focus placed them in a strong position, allowing them to become even more concentrated on these metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Despite rising interest rates, Employment Hero's performance has remained strong, with exceptional net revenue retention and robust growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This resilience is partly attributed to the tight employment market, which has prompted them to expand their services "upstream" into the recruitment market to help clients find people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Leadership and Vision
Ben Thompson attributes his ability to manage a rapidly growing company to his passion for his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. He works from home to support his family, including a child with special needs, and dedicates significant hours because he loves what he does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. His core motivation for Employment Hero, and all his past businesses, is to empower employers to feel proud and confident in their role of creating jobs and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### Master Plans
Thompson structures his company's vision using "master plans," inspired by Elon Musk's playbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. These plans provide a vivid, high-level picture of the company's future, typically two pages long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. Master Plan Part Two, for example, focused on sustaining remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. He notes that ideas for these plans emerge over time and then compel him to document them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.

## Remote-First Philosophy
Employment Hero adopted a remote-first approach after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, recognizing the fundamental benefits of remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

### Benefits of Remote Work
*   **Flexibility:** Provides crucial flexibility for working parents, individuals with disabilities who face commuting challenges, and pet carers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Empowerment:** Allows talented individuals in rural or remote communities, who traditionally couldn't access high-powered executive jobs, to contribute equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Global Connection:** Extends opportunities to people in developing countries, particularly as satellite internet services like Starlink connect billions to the world of work and education for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Thompson views this as a significant social good, empowering billions to live better lives and constructively contribute to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Critique of Return-to-Office Mandates
Thompson believes that forcing knowledge workers back to the office, even for a few days a week, is unintelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This approach limits the recruitment pool to a small geographic zone (e.g., 25-50 kilometers from a capital city), whereas a remote-first model allows companies to recruit from anywhere globally, limited only by time zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. He dismisses the argument for "serendipitous moments" and "brainstorming" in the office, suggesting that most great ideas come from individual intense thought and understanding problems from first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. He considers a hybrid model to be "the worst of both worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

## [[leadership_lessons_and_company_building_in_the_tech_industry | Building a Global Workforce]]
While remote work offers vast opportunities, [[building_a_successful_tech_startup | building a successful tech startup]] with a global workforce presents complexities. Employment Hero, leveraging Ben Thompson's background as an employment lawyer, acknowledges the challenges of different legal frameworks (public holidays, long service leave, workers' compensation) across states and countries, as well as time zones, language barriers, and cultural differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

### Global Teams Product
Employment Hero developed its "Global Teams" business specifically to address these challenges, making remote employment sustainable and accessible, particularly for Small to Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Large corporations like Microsoft have dedicated HR managers globally, but SMEs lack such resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

Global Teams provides:
*   **Established Employment Entities:** The company has set up legal entities in countries worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Legal Compliance:** It incorporates and ensures adherence to legal minimum entitlements for employees, typically exceeding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.
*   **Integrated Services:** Organized payroll, recruitment, and HR platform for managing employees (e.g., one-on-ones, performance reviews, HR files, pay files) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Talent Portal:** Connects to approximately 1,500 job boards globally, allowing users to post jobs directly from Employment Hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. An integration with LinkedIn enables free job postings worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.
*   **Efficient Onboarding:** Aims to onboard new hires in as little as eight minutes once talent is found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

This platform makes it as easy to employ someone internationally as it is locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. An example use case is a Sydney startup using Global Teams to hire virtual assistants from the Philippines, bookkeepers from Malaysia, or engineers from Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

### Cultivating Culture in a Remote-First Environment
With 825 employees globally, up from 180 before the pandemic, Employment Hero's culture largely developed remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. Key strategies include:
*   **Asynchronous Communication:** Encouraging recorded video/audio messages and allowing team members to respond when it makes sense for them, often leading to more considered responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
*   **Clear OKRs (Objectives and Key Results):** Providing clear objectives and empowering employees with autonomy and trust to achieve difficult tasks independently while remaining aligned with company goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
*   **Technological Advancements:** Utilizing real-time transcription and translation services (likened to "battle fish" from *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*) to overcome language barriers in meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.
*   **True Diversity:** A global remote workforce naturally fosters immense diversity across cultures, religions, races, languages, and genders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.
*   **Deliberate Camaraderie:** To maintain social connections, Employment Hero hosts an annual "Global Gathering," offering a five-day, all-expenses-paid trip to a foreign country (e.g., Thailand, Vietnam) for all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. This deliberate effort is believed to build a stronger, more collaborative team than a year of in-office work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.

## Future Vision and Products
Employment Hero's long-term vision is to become the world's largest platform for managing human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. Ben Thompson likens existing HR/payroll software to "tools" (like a drill and hammer) needed to hang a painting, whereas the ultimate goal is the "painting on the wall" itself: talented labor working productively as fast as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. The company aims to provide talent directly into the platform for any role currently managed on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.

### Swag: The Employment Super App
Swag is Employment Hero's first consumer app, designed to leverage the platform's significant buying power (managing payroll for over a million people, representing about 15% of Australia's private sector workforce and $75 billion in buying power) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. The app aims to make people better off, especially amid the cost of living crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.

Key features of Swag:
*   **Instapay:** Provides real-time access to earned wages, moving towards a future where people are paid hourly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.
*   **Discounts:** Includes features like "Hero Shop" for discounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Employment Platform:** A single app for finding work, managing work, getting paid, and managing spending and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>.
*   **Dynamic CV:** Updates an employee's CV hourly, showing hours worked, roles, and qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>.

### Other Future Endeavors
*   **International Expansion:** Aggressively entering the UK market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.
*   **AI Integration:** Already released AI features and is developing Horizon 2 and Horizon 3 features for future release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:37:59]</a>.

Employment Hero's objective is to streamline the process of acquiring and managing talent, allowing founders and SMEs to focus on their core competencies while the platform handles everything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.

Elizabeth Yin, co-founder of [[venture_capital_and_angel_investing | Hustle Fund]], a well-known pre-seed fund across America, has an extensive background as an entrepreneur and former Google employee, offering valuable insights into [[investing_in_australian_tech_startups | investing]] and founding companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Motivation and Mission
Elizabeth Yin's driving motivation stems from a desire to build a "huge business" that could be her "life's work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. After a modest exit from her previous advertising-related company, she realized her passion lay with founders and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. She observed that many founders, even great ones, often struggle with access to capital, knowledge, and networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This led to Hustle Fund's mission: to empower great founders by providing access to capital, knowledge, and networks, going beyond just the investment piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Early Exposure to Startups
Elizabeth does not believe that being a founder is hereditary, attributing her path to time and place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area during the dot-com boom in the late 1990s allowed her to get involved with startups even as a high schooler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Her first direct experience with a startup was in 1996, helping her friend's cousin, Tony Hsieh, build chairs, tables, and even make ethernet cables by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Despite the chaos, there was "good energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This company later sold to Microsoft for an alleged couple hundred million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Personal Traits and Superpower
Elizabeth identifies herself as an "underdog" who thrives on going and doing things and proving people wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This trait was reinforced by a demeaning encounter with an angel investor from Google, who questioned her ability to lead a team of 100 people, calling her a "Meek Asian woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

She believes her superpower is self-awareness, allowing her to understand her strengths and weaknesses and "play games" where she has an edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Her key strengths include being frugal and resourceful, enabling her to achieve results with limited budgets and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This frugality is particularly beneficial for running a pre-seed fund, where operations typically yield no significant returns for 10 to 15 years, and earnings might only match those of a Google product manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

## Career Transitions and Learnings

### International Experiences
Early in her career, Elizabeth gained international experience through internships in Switzerland, Japan, and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. These experiences shaped her perspectives and understanding of various businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. One notable instance involved taking a job in Tokyo, which she secured by winning a contest for a free trip to Boston <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Despite not being qualified and getting fired a month after landing in Tokyo, she negotiated to stay for a year, gaining invaluable learning experiences that informed her current perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. She reflects that failure can open new doors, contrasting the potentially slow professional growth she might have experienced if she had been successful in that role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### Time at Google
Elizabeth joined Google in 2007 when it already had 20,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. While she respected the "top-notch" and competent people she worked with, she found the culture challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. The flat hierarchy, which worked in Google's early years, led to confusion and "constant whiplash" with too many projects and executives frequently overriding decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. This environment led her to conclude it wasn't a place where she could thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. Her time at Google taught her "how not to grow a company," observing that Google's success largely came from strong product-market fit and effective M&A, rather than its internal culture at that scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

### Founding LaunchBit
In late 2008, despite Sequoia Capital's "Rest in Peace Good Times" memo warning of a capital drought, Elizabeth decided to leave Google and start a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. She couldn't raise money due to the market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. This turned out to be a "blessing in disguise" as she was initially very naive about building a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. At that time, there was little available online knowledge on how to start a company, pre-dating frameworks like Lean Startup and popular blogs/YouTube channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. Her first product with a co-founder failed because they spent months building it without validating demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

Key mistakes and learnings from LaunchBit:
*   **Validating demand:** Essential to do early, though more common now due to frameworks like Lean Startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.
*   **Setting culture:** Crucial from the outset, though often nebulous for founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. Initially, she hired based on skill set rather than cultural fit, which is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. Hustle Fund prioritizes kindness and personality fit, even if it means delaying hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This requires marketing to potential job candidates, not just customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
*   **Lack of guidance:** She wished she had had better guidance on how to build a startup, which was hard to find at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

LaunchBit, an advertising business, eventually sold. Elizabeth notes that the ads business is cutthroat and tends towards consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. Her decision to exit was based on the professional assessment that the company was not on a trajectory for continued winning in that specific "game," combined with a personal feeling that the team's culture needed a "redo" and personal disillusionment with the ads world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

## Transition to Investing and Hustle Fund

### Learning to Invest
Elizabeth's transition to investing was gradual, starting at 500 Startups as a mentor and advisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. She eventually ran their accelerator program for almost three years, overseeing 200 investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. This experience provided "investing lessons on steroids," much faster than if she had invested her own money or worked at a traditional VC fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. She believes working at or mentoring for an accelerator is one of the best ways to learn [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | how to invest]] because it provides a high volume of "reps"â€”meeting many companies (good, bad, and ugly) and getting a tight feedback loop on investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. Traditional VCs, in contrast, don't get as many "yes" opportunities or a tight feedback loop, which can span 5-15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>.

### Starting Hustle Fund
In early 2017, Elizabeth and her business partner, Eric Bond, decided to focus on [[investing_in_consumer_internet_companies | investing in startups]] as their primary business model for the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>. They identified a significant opportunity in pre-seed funding, as there was a "dirth of investors" who truly go in early, pre-revenue, with half-baked ideas or products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.

Initially, they found it challenging to differentiate Hustle Fund to potential Limited Partners (LPs), receiving feedback that their pitch was similar to thousands of other funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. After about 20 iterations, their unique pitch highlighted:
*   Addressing the gap for founders without "rich uncles" at the pre-seed stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.
*   Investing globally in many companies with small $25k checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
*   Working closely with founders and potentially doubling down at the seed stage (around 20% of the time) based on their operations and alignment, rather than just pitch discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>.

This model was differentiated and leveraged their experience from accelerator programs where they observed which teams emerged as strong bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

### Characteristics of Successful Founders
At the pre-seed stage, Hustle Fund looks for "speed" in founders, which is why the fund is named "Hustle Fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. Successful founders are excellent at:
*   **De-risking ideas quickly:** Running many experiments or "shots on goal" within a compacted period to increase likelihood of success and move on from failed ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.
*   **Learning new skills quickly:** CEOs must wear many hats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>.
*   **Charisma and team building:** Ability to attract a great team to compensate for weaknesses, even with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>.
*   **Prioritization:** Focusing on the single most important thing to figure out in the next 2-4 weeks and letting everything else drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.
*   **Frugality:** Stretches runway and dollars, often by convincing talent to work for equity rather than high salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.
*   **Sales skills:** Not just selling to customers but also to the team, convincing them of the long-term value of the company's equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>.

Ultimately, a successful CEO needs to perform "reasonably well" across strategic thinking, quick thinking, and sales skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>.

### Scaling Hustle Fund Operations
With around 30 people, Hustle Fund manages its extensive portfolio and sourcing by:
*   **Leveraging other business lines:** Beyond management fees from their three funds, other revenue-generating business lines allow them to hire more staff to support founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
*   **Building systems and processes:** Utilizing technology and streamlined processes, such as running workshops for multiple founders simultaneously who share common problems (e.g., raising money, customer acquisition, pitch decks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. This allows them to "scale ourselves" and "punch above our weight" compared to other funds of similar size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.

Elizabeth dedicates significant time to building the organization, focusing on culture (e.g., ensuring kindness in hiring) and operations/scaled processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>.

## Building Brand and Customer Acquisition
Hustle Fund approaches its brand building like a startup, drawing lessons from Elizabeth's past experience with customer acquisition at LaunchBit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. While Hustle Fund isn't selling a product for dollars, they "sell" the brand to attract founders to take their investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>. This involves extensive customer acquisition experiments across various channels like Clubhouse, TikTok, and YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. Some experiments, like TikTok, were "killed," while others, like Twitter, proved highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. By observing that over half of their company applications came via Twitter, they focused heavily on it, tweeting daily and analyzing data to find repeatable processes for successful topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>.

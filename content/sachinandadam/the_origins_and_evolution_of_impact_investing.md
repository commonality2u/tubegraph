Sir Ronald Cohen, a prominent figure in [[social_venture_capital_and_impact_investing | impact investing]], is credited with pioneering the concept and revolutionizing investment by integrating social and environmental governance standards into financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. His work is detailed in his book, "Impact: Reshaping Capitalism to Drive Real Change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## Early Life and Influences

Born in Egypt, Sir Ronald's worldview was significantly shaped by his family's experience as refugees during the Suez crisis when he was 11 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. His parents portrayed their arrival in Britain as a challenge, instilling in him a drive to excel and look after his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. This period, coupled with his time at Oxford in the 1960s, reinforced values of idealism and a desire to improve the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. He consistently strived to do "big things that improve the world" while ensuring his family's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Venture Capital Pioneer

After studying at Harvard Business School, Sir Ronald founded Apax Partners at the age of 26, effectively introducing [[social_venture_capital_and_impact_investing | venture capital]] to the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. His decision was catalyzed by the emerging microchip [[social_impact_and_innovation_in_emerging_technologies | technology]] and a new entrepreneurial spirit he observed in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. He believed in the potential of entrepreneurs to overcome challenges and innovate, contrasting with the prevailing view that only large companies could succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

He had an intuition that this new field would work, despite initial skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:05]</a>. His motto for success was: "Start young, think big, and stick with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. This dedication was evident in the nine difficult years it took him to raise his first [[social_venture_capital_and_impact_investing | venture fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>. His firm was among the early investors in Apple, a decision based on the idea of creating a small computer for individual desks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>.

## The Shift to Impact Investing

By 1998, at 53, Sir Ronald felt his life's purpose extended beyond financial returns, prompting him to seek a "bigger meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. He decided to leave Apax Partners to focus on two critical issues: addressing [[intersection_of_business_and_social_impact | social issues]] systemically and contributing to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>.

In 2000, a call from the British Treasury provided a pivotal opportunity to examine how to tackle poverty more entrepreneurially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:00">[22:10:00]</a>. He realized that relying solely on government spending and philanthropy was insufficient to address social challenges at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>. The key was to bring investment to [[intersection_of_business_and_social_impact | social entrepreneurs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:14:00">[23:14:00]</a>. This realization led to the conceptualization of [[social_venture_capital_and_impact_investing | impact investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:28:00">[23:28:00]</a>.

### Key Milestones:

*   **Bridges Ventures (2002)**: Created to invest [[social_venture_capital_and_impact_investing | venture capital]] and growth equity in underserved regions of the UK, demonstrating market rates of return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:58:00">[23:58:00]</a>.
*   **Social Finance (2007)**: Founded to further develop the field of [[social_venture_capital_and_impact_investing | social finance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:13:00">[24:13:00]</a>.
*   **Social Impact Bond (2010)**: This groundbreaking instrument was conceived when two young people from Social Finance proposed linking financial returns for investors to a reduction in young prisoners re-offending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a>. The idea was to pay investors for achieved social outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>. Today, over 200 Social Impact Bonds exist in 30+ countries addressing 15+ social issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>.
*   **Sustainability-Linked Bonds and Loans**: The Social Impact Bond model has expanded into mainstream financial markets, with over a trillion dollars raised in sustainability-linked bonds and loans where interest rates are tied to achieving social or environmental objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:00">[25:21:00]</a>.

## Global Movement and Redefining Capitalism

In 2013, the British government appointed Sir Ronald to chair the G8 Taskforce on [[social_venture_capital_and_impact_investing | Impact Investment]], inviting [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_australian_tech_ecosystem | Australia]] as an observer due to its early engagement in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38:00">[26:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:00">[27:04:00]</a>. The task force observed a global shift where young consumers, talent, and investors increasingly preferred companies that focused on positive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a>.

Impact investment was formally defined as "having the intention to create impact as well as profit, but also measuring the impact created" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:10:00">[28:10:00]</a>. This marked the beginning of a trend to integrate good into investment decisions, shifting the economic paradigm from merely balancing risk and return to optimizing "risk, return, and impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:42:00">[28:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>.

Modern [[social_impact_and_innovation_in_emerging_technologies | technologies]] like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are seen as crucial enablers for delivering global impact through areas like [[social_impact_and_innovation_in_emerging_technologies | fintech]], remote learning, and clean energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:00">[29:20:00]</a>.

### Measuring Impact

A key missing piece was the measurement of impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:53:00">[29:53:00]</a>. Sir Ronald led efforts at Harvard Business School to develop Impact-Weighted Accounts, which measure companies' environmental and employment impacts in monetary terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:16:00">[30:16:00]</a>. This research has revealed that some companies create more environmental damage than profit, and has enabled comparisons of "diversity debits" among firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:41:00">[30:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16:00">[31:16:00]</a>. For example, Amazon has a $6 billion diversity debit, while Apple has $2.5 billion, though Amazon performs better relative to total wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>. This work demonstrates a correlation between companies that pollute more and lower stock market valuations, indicating that impactful companies attract more consumers, talent, and investors, making them more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:09:00">[35:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>.

## The Future of Impact

The current economic imperative is for businesses to measure and manage their impacts, redefining product strategies to deliver positive improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:38:00">[33:38:00]</a>. The rise of companies like Tesla, which aimed to deliver positive change beyond just profit, exemplifies the power of this "mega-trend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:21:00">[32:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:43:00">[32:43:00]</a>. Sir Ronald anticipates the emergence of "Elon Musks and Bill Gates and Steve Jobses of impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:52:00">[32:52:00]</a>.

### Education Outcomes Fund: A Passion Project

Sir Ronald is particularly passionate about education, viewing it as the biggest lever for [[intersection_of_business_and_social_impact | social improvement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:37:00">[36:37:00]</a>. He has dedicated significant effort to the Education Outcomes Fund, an initiative designed to revolutionize educational attainment levels, particularly in Africa and the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:00">[37:17:00]</a>. This $1 billion fund utilizes the Social Impact Bond model, where a professional team contracts with NGOs and businesses, paying based on achieved educational outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:09:00">[38:09:00]</a>. The fund attracts investment, with initial funding from UBS and Bridges Ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:01:00">[39:01:00]</a>. This model aims to improve the education of millions of children globally by linking financial returns to tangible results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11:00">[40:11:00]</a>.

## Advice for Future Leaders

Sir Ronald advises young leaders to "believe in yourself," as they are ready to build businesses and create exciting ventures much sooner than they might think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:21:00">[41:21:00]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of doing "good and do well at the same time" for true fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:42:00">[41:42:00]</a>. His core message to the next generation of leaders is: "Do good, do well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:58:00">[47:58:00]</a>.

[[Sahil Blooms content creation journey | Sahil Bloom]] is a well-known content creator and investor, recognized for his Twitter threads, Substack, and podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He experienced a rapid ascent in the business world during 2020 and 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Initially, he started his career in private equity before venturing into content creation in early 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Early Career and Challenges
Sahil pursued both a Bachelor's and a Master's of Arts degree at Stanford University, where he also participated as an athlete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Despite attending Stanford and having good grades, he initially faced numerous rejections from jobs after college due to a lack of internship experience, which he couldn't gain because of his baseball commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This period, where he was close to graduation without a job, left him feeling "really lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. However, he eventually found his first job after someone "took a shot" on him, marking the first of many instances where intense difficulty preceded clarity in his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Motivation in Private Equity
Sahil spent six years in the private equity world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. His main motivations for staying in the field were his love for learning and the people-oriented nature of the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Private equity offered a continuous learning experience, exposing him to diverse companies, industries, and new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. As he progressed, his role became increasingly focused on people, which aligned with his core identity as a "people person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. His bosses recognized this strength and consistently placed him in situations where he could leverage his interpersonal skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. Though he never saw private equity as his "life's work," it provided an "incredible set of experiences," foundational knowledge, and valuable relationships that continue to benefit him, with former partners now being major investors in his fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

He also emphasizes the importance of always keeping an eye on the skill set required for the job one *wants* in the future, not just the current job. For example, the skills of an analyst are very different from those of a partner. He focused on developing "commercial instinct" and people skills rather than just excelling at tasks like Excel, knowing those would be more valuable at a higher level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

## Transition to Entrepreneurship and SRB Ventures
The significant shift in Sahil's career came around the time of the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. He realized the world was changing dramatically and began to rethink his priorities, including seeing his parents more and wanting to be a more present father to his future children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. He concluded that working 90-100 hours a week for a fixed salary wasn't a "smart trade" if he could work less, potentially make more money through leverage, and have a more efficient career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>.

He initially tried to transition from later-stage private equity to earlier-stage investing, interviewing with venture capital and crossover investment funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. He admits this was driven by external impressions and what he thought would make his parents proud or look good on LinkedIn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. However, he faced rejection, often being told his private equity background didn't fit, or that his public social media presence (Twitter) was an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. After a final rejection from a desired firm, he felt he had made a "really bad mistake," having already informed his previous firm he was leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This moment of darkness was followed by sudden clarity after a conversation with his friend Sean Puri, who pointed out that Sahil was pursuing a path based on external expectations rather than his true energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This led him to a more entrepreneurial path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

As of very recently, Sahil is the Managing Partner at SRB Ventures, a small venture capital fund focused on "investing in the companies of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Investment Philosophy at SRB Ventures
At SRB Ventures, Sahil seeks companies and founders who are "taking big swings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. He invests in early-stage, risky startups in large markets with potentially "game-changing technologies or solutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. His goal is to invest in ventures that, if successful, could become $10 billion companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. He has no interest in investing in businesses that might only be worth $20-40 million if successful, preferring to own such businesses directly through a holding company he has with a friend for "micro software businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

From a founder perspective, he looks for "resilience and grit" – the ability to get "punched in the face and get back up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. He believes it's "hard to bet against a person who just keeps getting back up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.

## [[Angel investing and networking strategies | Angel Investing]] and the Changing Venture Landscape
Before launching SRB Ventures, Sahil engaged in [[angel_investing_and_networking_strategies | angel investing]] for several years, investing in over 30 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. His early [[angel_investing_and_networking_strategies | angel investing]] was primarily through his personal networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. He cautions against "adverse selection" – being wary of opportunities that come to you too easily, especially early in one's career without a platform or established value-add <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. Some of his "worst mistakes" early on stemmed from not considering why he was being offered an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

He emphasizes that investing should also consider "broader returns beyond the financial returns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. He recounts making a $10,000 investment in a deal led by a prominent investor like David Sacks, even though he was "mixed" on the financial prospects of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. His rationale was that he would have paid $10,000 just to have dinner with David Sacks and potentially build a relationship, seeing the investment as a way to gain access and learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. This strategy proved valuable, leading to future deals with Craft Ventures and Sacks becoming an investor in his fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

Sahil believes that the nature of [[angel_investing_and_networking_strategies | angel investing]] and early-stage venture capital is "completely changed" by the rise of creators and individuals building large distribution channels on platforms like Substack and Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>. He sees a "barbell" forming in the venture landscape:
*   **One end**: Large, established venture capital firms like Benchmark, Sequoia, Andreessen, and Tiger, which offer significant "cachet" to founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **The other end**: Individuals like himself and Packy McCormack, who have raised funds and offer a "very specific way that they're going to impact your company" by getting on their cap table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. These individuals can provide "massively outsized impact" for a small amount of dilution, often writing smaller checks ($100k-$250k) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.

He believes this model drives "differentiated deal flow" because larger funds and founders are willing to bring them in due to their ability to positively impact outcomes with a small check, without being viewed as competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. He anticipates these new models will drive "outsized returns" in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

## Prioritization and Career Advice
Reflecting on his 20s and early career, Sahil advises young professionals to identify early on whether they are a "builder" or a "salesman/saleswoman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. While he was never a coder, he learned how to "sell" — a broad term encompassing selling oneself, ideas, or investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. He values his private equity background for teaching him storytelling, identifying and learning ideas, and concisely delivering abstract information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

His advice for a 20-something is to "find a place where you can really learn and enhance one of those two skills" – building or selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>. He believes that if one can either build or sell, they will "always have value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. For most people, the answer is to learn how to sell, as it is "the most valuable skill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.

Sahil also emphasizes the importance of managing one's focus areas in life, comparing it to the "three aspects to college" (athletics, academics, social), where one can optimize two out of three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. He advises explicitly communicating priorities to those around you, as he learned when his intense career focus in his early 20s made it hard for friends to spend time with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.

His ultimate advice for 20-something leaders is not to put "so much pressure on yourself" to achieve specific milestones by certain timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>. Instead, he suggests:
*   Be curious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.
*   Spend time with great people and develop deep relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.
*   Be in rooms where you're "the dumbest one," absorbing, listening, and asking questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>.

He believes that if you have "insatiable curiosity for the world and for life," the rest will "sort of take care of itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>.

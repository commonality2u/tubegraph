Sir Ronald Cohen, a pioneer in impact investing, emphasizes that [[edrolos_impact_on_education | education]] is "the biggest leaver for social improvement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:37:00">[36:37:00]</a>. He believes that transformative change in society is deeply intertwined with advancements in educational access and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:37:00">[36:37:00]</a>.

## Personal Reflections on Education's Impact

Sir Ronald's own life experiences highlight the pivotal [[reflections_on_education_and_careers | role of education]] in overcoming adversity and fostering personal growth. Arriving in Britain as an 11-year-old refugee from Egypt during the Suez Crisis, he initially did not speak English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Despite these [[challenges_in_the_current_education_system | challenges]], his father instilled in him the expectation of academic excellence, famously telling a headmaster that Ronald would be "top of the class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Ronald found learning easy, having been top of his class at a strict Catholic school in Egypt that included Jewish, Christian, and Muslim students who coexisted well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. With the help of a "brilliant professor of history" at a grammar school, he was coached and gained entry into Oxford University against expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

These formative experiences shaped his worldview, reinforcing values of helping those less well-off and sharing life's benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. He attributes his success partly to finding learning easy and the values instilled by his family, but also to the profound influence of his refugee experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

## Challenges in Current Education Systems

Sir Ronald highlights significant deficiencies in global education systems, stating that they "don't do what they can do for social mobility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:45:00">[36:45:00]</a>. This is true not only in emerging countries but also in developed nations where the "equality of opportunity for education just isn't there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:48:00">[36:48:00]</a>. He notes that the traditional approaches relying solely on government spending and philanthropy are insufficient to address the systemic issues of poverty and its social consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>.

## Innovative Solutions: The Education Outcomes Fund

To address these [[challenges_in_the_current_education_system | challenges]], Sir Ronald has devoted significant effort to the Education Outcomes Fund (EOF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:17:00">[37:17:00]</a>. This initiative aims to revolutionize improvements in educational attainment levels by applying principles from social impact bonds on a much larger scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:30:00">[37:30:00]</a>.

The EOF is envisioned as a billion-dollar outcomes fund specifically for [[the_impact_of_education_communities | education]] in Africa and the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:09:00">[38:09:00]</a>, run by a professional team led by Dr. Anna Kabul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:15:00">[38:15:00]</a>.

### How the Education Outcomes Fund Works:
*   **Performance-based funding:** The fund signs contracts with NGOs and businesses, promising payment if specific improvements in educational attainment levels are achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:00">[38:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36:00">[38:36:00]</a>. For example, they might pay $30 million if 300,000 children reach certain educational levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:38:00">[38:38:00]</a>.
*   **Incentivizing specific outcomes:** Payments are structured to incentivize particular positive impacts:
    *   More for girls than boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:47:00">[38:47:00]</a>.
    *   More for rural areas than urban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:49:00">[38:49:00]</a>.
    *   More for children with disabilities than able-bodied children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:52:00">[38:52:00]</a>.
*   **Attracting investment:** This model attracts investment through dedicated funds, such as the initial $100 million fund set up by UBS and Bridges Ventures for educational impact bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:01:00">[39:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits for social entrepreneurs:** Social entrepreneurs can raise capital from these funds, knowing they will be repaid with interest if they deliver on their agreed-upon educational improvements. Their investors receive a return linked to the success achieved, and the organization itself retains a surplus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:33:00">[39:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:43:00">[39:43:00]</a>.

With 800 million children globally either out of education or not learning effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:05:00">[40:05:00]</a>, the EOF aims to improve the [[the_impact_of_education_communities | education]] of 10 million children with just one billion-dollar fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11:00">[40:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:13:00">[40:13:00]</a>. Sir Ronald believes that 80 such funds, or even larger ones, could "transform attainment levels" worldwide over time, with governments willing to contribute to the outcome payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:20:00">[40:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:26:00">[40:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:30:00">[40:30:00]</a>. This shift towards tying rewards to outcomes is seen as a "very revolutionary model" for social improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:51:00">[40:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:53:00">[40:53:00]</a>.

Nick Crocker, a partner at Blackbird since 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, is recognized as one of the OGs of the Australian [[venture_capital_and_angel_investing | BCE industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. He is also a three-time exited [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | founder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> and previously served as CEO of Startmate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, a community-based organization that has spurred the Australian ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Transition to Venture Capital

Crocker's path to [[venture_capital_and_angel_investing | venture capital]] was driven by a quest for inspirational people and a desire to understand entrepreneurial models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. After initially studying law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a> and working in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, he discovered the world of [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | startups]] at age 23, realizing it offered a path to being "completely self-defined" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This discovery led him to pursue entrepreneurship, initially through a self-started agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a> and later through building companies like Sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

Despite being a three-time exited [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | founder]], Crocker considers his past ventures not "successful" on a meaningful scale because they didn't endure for more than about three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. He defines success in entrepreneurship as "building something enduring and then something that you can pass on to someone else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. He sees Blackbird as "easily the most successful thing I've ever been a part of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.

Crocker believes his journey as a [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | founder]] who "didn't reach" the heights of some other players, parallels successful coaches in sports who were "failed players" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. This experience has built a "passion or an empathy" for what it means to be a [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | founder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. He doesn't want to be a [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | founder]] again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>, finding fulfillment in supporting [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | founders]] and holding "admiration" for their struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.

## Founder-First Investing Philosophy

Crocker's [[challenges_and_strategies_in_venture_investing | investment]] approach is not thematic; instead, he is "excited about [[key_investments_and_experiences_in_venture_capital | investing]] in [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | founders]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. He describes the [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | investment]] process as unique because out of 100 meetings, 98 will be a "pass," but twice in every 50 meetings, he experiences a "rush of emotion" that signals a potential [[key_investments_and_experiences_in_venture_capital | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>. This intuitive sense, often felt within the first four minutes of a meeting, is based on the "art of how you make someone feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

He believes his strength lies in this [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | founder-driven investing style]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. He attributes his ability to assess talent to:
*   **Diverse Life Experiences**: Growing up in a country town, navigating different social groups on buses, and living in various countries like France, Mexico, New York, and San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>. These experiences have given him a "natural tune in to people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>.
*   **Natural Curiosity**: Inherited from his mother, a GP, a deep curiosity about people's stories drives him to want to be "a part of their story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>.
*   **Constant Assessment**: He consistently tries to "size someone up" and understand "what makes them tick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>.

He tempers his intuitive approach by seeking input from his partners at Blackbird, who are not like him, ensuring a "pretty aggressive pursuit of truth" in [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | IC meetings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>.

## Challenges and Insights in Venture Investing

Crocker acknowledges that [[challenges_and_strategies_in_venture_investing | success in venture]] is "one good company a decade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>, highlighting the long-term nature and inherent luck involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. He self-assesses his performance by tracking "how much money have I [[key_investments_and_experiences_in_venture_capital | invested]] in [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | Founders]] and what is the current value of that money today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>, even though Blackbird tracks performance at a team level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>. He also focuses on his "deal flow" quality, aiming for meetings with companies that genuinely excite him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>.

## Longterm Perspectives on Venture Capital and Business Growth

Crocker is astounded by the growth of the Australian [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | startup]] ecosystem since his return in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>. He points to a cultural shift around 2009-2010 where brilliant minds began choosing to become [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | founders]] instead of pursuing academic or corporate careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.

He views Australia's superannuation funds as a significant advantage, representing one of the largest pools of sovereign wealth globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>. If the ecosystem can earn the right to a fraction of this capital, it can fund itself "in perpetuity," creating billions of dollars in new jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>. He rates the first ten years of this experiment (2012-2022) as "A-plus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a> but feels a "weight of responsibility" to ensure the next decade is just as successful, especially with billions in new capital to deploy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

While acknowledging tendencies like "tall poppy syndrome" outside the community and risk aversion among young people, he believes the momentum is in the right direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. He sees the "struggle" as useful, forcing the ecosystem to be resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. He emphasizes the "circularity of success," where [[venture_capital_and_angel_investing | venture capital]] success ultimately benefits everyday Australians through their superannuation investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>.

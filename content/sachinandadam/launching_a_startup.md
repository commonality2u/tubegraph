The hosts, Sain and Adam, embark on a "building public" series to offer a raw and real, behind-the-scenes look at building their company. This includes documenting their journey, discussing fundraising, typical weekly activities, challenges, and how it impacts their personal lives and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Initial Launch and Reception
Upon launching, Max, one of the founders, describes the experience as "really, really exciting to finally share a bit more about what we're doing with the rest of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Despite the initial success, he notes "we still have a long way to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

The launch generated significant visibility, with "a bit over a million impressions" on content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. From an outsider's perspective, it appeared to be "almost a 10 out of 10 launch," with LinkedIn posts garnering about a million impressions and Twitter posts hundreds of thousands of views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. These "vanity metrics" are considered important for a consumer company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Post-Launch Feelings
Max expressed feeling "more excited and more nervous" after the launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Excitement** stems from receiving a positive response to their contribution to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Nervousness** arises from the need to deliver on the mission and vision they have put forward, acknowledging it will be "really, really hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   He views the pressure from public attention as "good pressure" because it means they "don't have a choice" and "have to make this succeed now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Max believes the launch "did better than we expected," but "in retrospect there's so much we could have done better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. It resulted in a hiring pipeline of "hundreds of candidates" and "tens of thousands of waitlist signups," which are seen as "Upstream of Revenue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Factors Contributing to Virality
Several elements contributed to the launch's viral success:
*   **Building in Stealth** for a period, laying groundwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Existing Following** that could be leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Emotionally Salient Narrative**: Many people resonated with the message due to their own "tough experience with the healthcare system," finding the company's work a "glimmer of hope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Visually Stunning Website** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> and a "reasonably conspicuous" domain name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Prior Conversations and Support**: The founders had engaged in "close to a thousand conversations with Healthcare professionals Founders operators over the last 3 to 4 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The launch provided a way for these people to publicly show their support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Commitment to the Mission
Max emphasizes the importance of a deep commitment to the company's mission. He champions the idea of the "30-year company," moving away from the model of building a "widget that can exit after 5 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Instead, the focus is on solving "real problems people care about" and building a company around that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Every person hired is expected to be committed to building the company for "30 plus years," creating a strong emotional connection to their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Max personally committed to "go all in" on this venture, unlike previous "stepping stones" for experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

The company aims to make advanced medicine, currently available only to the "hyper wealthy," accessible to mainstream populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This aligns with the historical trend of technological progress making what was once exclusive available to many (e.g., clean water, electricity, computers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Key Learnings on [[Building a successful tech startup|Company Building]]

### Importance of Team and Leverage
A primary learning is the underestimated importance of the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. Companies are defined by "good people in a sitting in a room together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. Continuously upgrading processes for hiring, onboarding, and extracting the best from people is crucial, as it provides "ultimate leverage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>.

### Prioritization
Prioritization is essential for driving company success, requiring a "really, really ruthless" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. Identifying a few core "buckets" that truly drive success (e.g., product differentiation, content quality, advertising sales) helps avoid getting "carried away with things that are sort of adjacent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.

Spending upfront time, even 10-15 minutes daily, on planning is considered the "highest leverage thing" a founder can do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. The goal is to move the needle on the 2-3 most important priorities each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.

### Managing Anxiety and Stress
Founders often face significant anxiety, which can lead to operating in a "hyper hyper logical" or "operator mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>. This mode, while productive in terms of output, might steer efforts in the wrong direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>. The best response to anxiety might be to pause, rethink, and make sure actions align with priorities, rather than just working harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

Stress is viewed as a "muscle" that strengthens with adaptive experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. The "golden zone" for founders is where stress and lack of sleep do not negatively impact performance, avoiding the "dead zone" of burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

### Communication and Clarity
For early-stage companies, minimizing context switching and ensuring clarity on priorities are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. Max's company implements "Deep work Wednesday" and meeting-free afternoons to reduce distractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

Drawing inspiration from Peter Thiel's approach at PayPal, where employees focused on "one thing" at a time, fosters accountability and prevents "procrastination" on less important tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

It is vital to **minimize the number of things communicated** to ensure the team remembers and rallies around critical objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. The goal is for every team member to know the "number one priority for the business right now" if asked in the middle of the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. This clarity allows people to "move faster" and understand the "why" behind their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

Founders must carefully manage what information is shared with the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. Max advises "never share ambiguity around the roadmap and the vision," as it can demotivate the team and make them fear wasted effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. However, sharing "uncertainty around execution against Vision" can build trust and a sense of urgency, fostering creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy for Founders

### Happiness and Performance
Happiness is seen as a choice, independent of external circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Max believes that happiness can coexist with stress and aggressive work, and actually "helps performance versus harms it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. This idea is likened to an athlete experiencing pain during a race but still finding "a sense of flow" and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

### The Role of Logic and Emotion
Max suggests that "often logic is a defense back" and a "symptom of stress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>. Instead of being hyper-logical and vigilant, it's important to allow for emotional processing and creative thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.

### Fostering Creativity and Insight
To cultivate creativity and deep thinking, it's beneficial to intentionally dedicate moments to "doing nothing" â€“ which actually means thinking, resetting, and relaxing, rather than mindlessly checking phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>.

Surrounding oneself with diverse people, especially those outside of one's core industry (e.g., tech), can lead to the "best insight" and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. Creative ideas often come from "least expected" places and by drawing inspiration from different domains, disciplines, and even games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>.

Inspired by Steve Jobs, creativity is viewed as recognizing "the best" from what has come before and combining it in a "novel and interesting way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

### Authentic Expression
Authentically expressing one's beliefs is crucial for emotional resonance with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. Every purchasing decision is ultimately an emotional one, justified by logic afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>. Founders should consider "what emotion do you want to feel or do you want someone to feel" and work backward to create that emotion through their story and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>.

## Future Focus

*   **Content Creation**: Continuing to create public content is a high-leverage activity that aids hiring, customer acquisition, narrative building, and branding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:23">[00:51:23]</a>.
*   **Execution of Content Strategy**: Ensuring the execution of a well-defined content strategy, including securing prominent guests, is a key focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>.
*   **"N of One" Uniqueness**: Striving for unique, "n of one" offerings that are an authentic extension of the founders and solve genuine customer problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>.

David Shane, founder of Australia's first unicorn company, Comtech, and co-founder of the OIF venture capital fund, emphasizes the importance of [[balancing_career_goals_with_personal_life_and_family | balancing career goals with personal life and family]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. His experiences highlight that while ambition is crucial, personal fulfillment and family well-being are equally vital for a truly successful life.

## Early Life and Risk-Taking
When David Shane immigrated from South Africa and decided to start Comtech, he already had a wife and a young child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Despite these personal responsibilities, he perceived the opportunity cost of starting a business as low. He was earning $2,000 a month in a job he disliked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Crucially, he was living with his in-laws, which meant he always had a roof over his head and his wife and son would have food on the table, significantly mitigating the financial risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This support system allowed him to take the entrepreneurial leap.

## Personal Fulfillment Beyond Financial Success
After selling Comtech for over a billion dollars, David Shane achieved immense financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. However, he quickly realized that financial success alone did not equate to personal fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. He describes the period after leaving Comtech as "debilitating" because he lacked purpose and the ability to add value, a stark contrast to his active role as a company founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>.

> "I didn't have a purpose. I just felt it was really debilitating having nothing to do, not being able to add value. You know, when you're running, when you're the founder of a company, yeah, your phone's ringing, you've got emails coming in. All of a sudden it literally goes from 100 to zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.

He found renewed purpose by dabbling in startups and helping founders, realizing he could make a difference without being the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. This passion for adding value to others became his new source of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.

## Maintaining Family Values
David Shane has been married to the same wife for 38 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a> and is a proud husband, dad, and grandfather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. He maintains a "fantastic [[balancing_work_life_and_personal_wellbeing | work-life balance]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

His primary life goal was not wealth, but to have a family like his best mate's family, the Brosens (founders of Nando's) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. He admired their consistency and resilience through both good and tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>.

He credits his wife, who was a stay-at-home mother, for helping keep the family grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>. He also shares that his approach to life is to live as he wants, not as people expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>. For example, he drives a Subaru because it fits his bicycle, not for show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.

Shane considers his true wealth to be the strong bond between his three sons, who would do anything for each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>. This personal connection and grounded approach underscore his philosophy on [[balancing_ambition_and_family_life | balancing ambition and family life]] with [[balancing_success_and_personal_fulfillment | success and personal fulfillment]].

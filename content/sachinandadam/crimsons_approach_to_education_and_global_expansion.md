Crimson is an education company focused on helping students reach their full potential on the world stage at top universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. The company's mission is to empower students and has been built over a long period of time in the world of education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

## Founder's Philosophy and Operational Approach

Jamie Beaton, Crimson's co-founder, applies a unique philosophy to both his academic pursuits and business operations.

### Risk Mitigation and Obsession
Contrary to the perception that entrepreneurs are all about taking big risks, Jamie Beaton's approach to building Crimson has been "obsessively mitigating risks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This applies to acquisitions, new business units, and [[expanding_a_business_internationally_and_managing_a_global_workforce | global expansion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. His internal monologue often involves quickly sifting through how a situation could "get ugly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. He aims to ensure the mitigation of existential risks when building something over a long period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

He describes himself as "pretty obsessive," pouring everything into his work at Crimson and other phases of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Despite this, he also values "chill time" with friends and family, new experiences, and exploring different states in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Questioning Perceived Rules
Jamie Beaton questions the perceived rules and assumptions about how long things should take or how hard they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This mentality began early, for instance, when he pushed his high school to allow him to take more subjects than the standard four, believing it would make him a better candidate for top universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. He believes that blindly following conventional advice can be disastrous for a business because "every path of success is so distinct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

### Time Management and Productivity
Beaton's weeks are intensely scheduled, often with calls from early morning until late at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. He structures his schedule with rigor, similar to how he used tutors in high school to stay efficient and motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. He is intentional about what needs to be done to complete academic journeys or business tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

Key strategies include:
*   **Efficiency in interactions:** Utilizing many 15-minute catch-ups for routine operations, noting that many tasks can be done in a quarter of the time typically allotted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   **Eliminating unnecessary activities:** Avoiding optional social events in college, which saved 40-50 hours a week, and being pragmatic about extracurriculars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Deep Work:** For creative thinking and research, like a PhD, he blocks out long periods (e.g., eight hours) to achieve high efficiency within the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
*   **Delegation:** Actively seeking to remove himself from parts of Crimson to bring in new capacity and scale the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
*   **Energy Management:** Emphasizing that time management is about managing energy and motivation, stressing the importance of engaging in activities one genuinely loves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. This passion makes learning enjoyable and provides stamina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

## Crimson's Global Expansion
Crimson had a [[rapid_company_growth_and_expansion_strategies | global ambition]] from day one, aiming to work with international students worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>.

### Strategy and Challenges
After gaining traction in New Zealand and Australia, the strategy was to build Crimson globally, entering foreign countries like Vietnam, Russia, and Thailand, where college admissions guidance was not yet strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This [[expanding_a_business_internationally_and_managing_a_global_workforce | rapid company growth and expansion strategies]] led to a "bet the company moment" during a two-to-four-year period, as it was capital-intensive to expand to over 20 countries in two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This phase involved learning to build a technology team and conduct digital marketing on a world stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

A significant challenge in [[expanding_a_business_internationally_and_managing_a_global_workforce | managing a global workforce]] across 20 countries, from Japan to Russia to Australia, is maintaining a harmonious set of Crimson values that resonate everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. The leadership team must be dynamic and adapt to local cultures, as a "Western approach" doesn't work in places like China, Korea, or Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

### Learnings from Academic Pursuits
Beaton's extensive academic pursuits directly informed Crimson's strategy:
*   **Business School (Stanford):**
    *   A sales management class taught by Mike Speer (founding CEO of Snowflake) provided insights into entering new markets, launching new products, and sales team structures, saving millions in go-to-market strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
    *   A Marketplace design class by a Google Economist helped shape how Crimson compensates its tutors and mentors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.
    *   An HR class focused on rigorous interviewing led Crimson to change its hiring process to prioritize work samples, boosting accuracy in hiring for key roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
*   **Military Studies (Kings College London):** Analogies between military conflict and business strategy offered "good mental heuristics" for competitive dynamics, understanding competitive advantage, and entrenched positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.
*   **Law School:** Helped in navigating regulatory regimes for acquisitions and new company registration, particularly in countries with more volatile legal systems like China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.
*   **Negotiation Class (Harvard):** A class on "negotiating through interpersonal conflict," taught by an instructor who taught terrorist negotiation to the CIA, was "so useful for so many interactions" within Crimson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

Beaton emphasized that if one remains "dialed into what other gems you can apply to what you're building," university experiences offer valuable content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>.

## [[The Value of Elite Educational Institutions]]
Jamie Beaton argues that the value of elite educational institutions is *increasing*, not decreasing, as evidenced by rising application numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. He highlights several benefits:
*   **Increased chances of success:** Over 80% of Y Combinator founders come from a top 20 US/UK university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.
*   **Higher seed round valuations:** Founders from these institutions may see their seed round pricing be two or three times higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.
*   **Founder Community:** Access to a founder community with potential co-founders and talented individuals, such as computer scientists who have interned at big tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.
*   **Alumni Network:** Alumni often become venture capital partners for fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.

He notes that the demand for college counseling advice is increasing because of the "family defining" career paths that top universities unlock for students, particularly international students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. He also challenges the "gossip girl" stereotype that these schools are mainly for rich kids, stating that a vast majority of Crimson students are from far-flung countries and attend through financial aid and scholarships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. Institutions actively push for diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.

## Crimson's Impact and Future Vision
Crimson's impact is seen in students working at companies like Tesla and OpenAI, raising multi-million dollar rounds, or joining leading private equity funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. This creates "mindblowing" career paths that are "family defining" for their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. Success stories, like Sam Taylor from Mount Maunganui getting into Harvard, trigger aspiration and momentum within communities, inspiring others to strive harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. This highlights the positive [[the_impact_of_education_communities | impact of education communities]].

For the next 10 years, Crimson is focused on:
*   **Expanding Impact:** Partnering with governments through initiatives like Charter schooling to broaden Crimson's [[edrolos_impact_on_education | impact on education]] to students from diverse backgrounds, including those who may not attend university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.
*   **New Ventures:** Launching a mental health platform to help high-performers navigate anxiety, depression, grit, and resilience, blurring the lines between education and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. This expands the mission beyond traditional academic assistance.
*   **Increasing Velocity:** Enhancing the speed of execution at Crimson and leveraging past learnings to generate more horsepower from the first ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

Jamie Beaton describes himself as a "mission entrepreneur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>, deeply caring about the education space and seeking to make an influence in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>. He advises founders to choose a space they are "really proud of," whose impact generates enduring motivation beyond revenue or scale metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

He continues his own [[reflections_on_education_and_careers | educational pursuits]], having recently started a new degree at Cornell in Healthcare policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>. He appreciates the "Disneyland"-like vibe of Stanford's campus, its focus on building companies, and its diverse international student body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>. The mentorship from figures like Julian Robertson (who built Tiger Management) and Jason Linger (Tiger Global) was foundational, emphasizing high-integrity, high-performance culture, and strategic advice for [[challenges_and_strategies_in_founding_a_global_investment_firm | building a global investment firm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

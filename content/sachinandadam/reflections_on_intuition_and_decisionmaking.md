This article explores various perspectives on intuition, intentionality, and decision-making, drawing insights from personal experiences and observations in business and life.

## The Role of Intuition

Intuition is conceptualized as access to experiences stored in the subconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Individuals with strong intuition or good judgment often possess three key characteristics:
1.  **Extensive Experiences:** They have seen and done a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>.
2.  **High Storage:** They are capable of remembering and storing these experiences and their learnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>.
3.  **High RAM:** In the moment of a decision, they can hold multiple experiences simultaneously and subconsciously, allowing for an amalgamation of these insights to inform their choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>.

It is suggested that "intuition brings you to a mountain, data helps you climb it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>, highlighting the complementary nature of both in effective [[Overcoming overthinking and decisionmaking | decision-making]].

## Shifting Beliefs and Intentionality

A significant personal shift can occur when moving from **mimetic desires** (inheriting desires from others or copying them) to intrinsically held beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. This transition emphasizes defining "good" by what one genuinely believes matters, rather than by external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:07]</a>.

This shift often involves becoming more intentional and reflective in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. Key aspects of fostering intentionality include:
*   **Reflection:** Regularly dedicating time to think deeply about one's life, values, and alignment with actions. This can involve "think weeks" or consistent journaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>.
*   **Clarity:** Gaining a clear understanding of what one truly desires out of life, narrowing down thousands of ideas to a focused few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>.
*   **Intentional Actions:** Thoughtfully considering actions rather than acting on superficial or unexamined desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>.

## Conviction and Risk-Taking

There is a balance between speed and certainty in [[Challenges and reflections in business decision making | business decision making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:22:00">[22:22:00]</a>. Often, 80% of the information is sufficient to make a decision, as 100% certainty is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>.

A practical approach to cultivating conviction is to "put your money where your mouth is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:47]</a>. This means acting on beliefs, whether in markets or other areas, which forces an assessment of one's conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>. Rating conviction (low, medium, high) internally can also provide clarity on how open one is to challenging a belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>.

The reluctance to take risks is attributed partly to the traditional school system, which rewards conformity over independent thought and risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>. In contrast, the real world often rewards those who see problems and actively work to fix them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>.

## Lessons for [[Career decision making | Career Growth]]

For young individuals looking to accelerate their growth, three elements are key:
1.  **Velocity:** Acting quickly, embracing short feedback loops, and engaging in continuous learning through activities like meeting people, reading, and initiating projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:30:00">[52:30:00]</a>.
2.  **Boldness:** Recognizing that not all actions are equal and that taking calculated risks is crucial. This includes reaching out to influential individuals or publicly sharing one's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:06:00">[53:06:00]</a>.
3.  **Reflection:** Deliberately engaging in self-reflection to foster independent thinking and ensure actions align with authentic desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:27:00">[53:27:00]</a>. This helps avoid simply copying others' paths and instead pursuing what genuinely resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:57:00">[53:57:00]</a>.

However, a caveat is that simply networking should not replace genuine learning and upskilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:06:00">[56:06:00]</a>. The focus should be on becoming interesting oneself, thereby attracting valuable connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:42:00">[55:42:00]</a>.

## [[Leadership insights and lessons | Leadership and Decision-Making]] in Practice

### As a Founder
Life as a founder often involves intense work hours, but the key is not just being busy but actively "moving the needle" every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:10:00">[59:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:00:49:00">[1:00:49:00]</a>. This involves:
*   **Hypothesis Validation:** Constantly refining a list of hypotheses and prioritizing which ones are most important to validate, then executing quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:05:00">[1:03:05:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Vision:** Thinking in 10- or 20-year intervals, driven by opinion and a desire to create a specific future, rather than short-term market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:04:00">[1:05:04:00]</a>.
*   **Challenging Dogma:** Disliking and actively questioning common assumptions, such as building in stealth mode versus public visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:11:00">[1:11:00]</a>, or premature optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:01:59:00">[1:01:59:00]</a>.

A crucial learning for founders is managing communication with the team, particularly regarding uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:06:00">[1:06:06:00]</a>. While founders must be comfortable with risk, employees often require more clarity and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:35:00">[1:06:35:00]</a>.

### As a Venture Capitalist
The role of a VC involves constant interaction with interesting founders and deeply questioning their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:10:41:00">[1:10:41:00]</a>. Key aspects include:
*   **Analytical Rigor:** While intuition is important, a strong analytical foundation in understanding business drivers is crucial, especially for later-stage companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:11:27:00">[1:11:27:00]</a>.
*   **Empathy:** Having firsthand or close experience with the challenges of [[Entrepreneurship and decisionmaking | building a company]] fosters empathy with founders, which is considered vital for effective engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:16:29:00">[1:16:29:00]</a>.
*   **Feedback vs. Advice:** Distinguishing between low-ego feedback (sharing observations and pattern matching) and high-ego advice (dictating actions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:12:44:00">[1:12:44:00]</a>. The best advice often comes in the form of thought-provoking questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:14:06:00">[1:14:06:00]</a>.
*   **Building a Brand:** Cultivating a personal or social brand can be a powerful tool for attracting promising companies, complementing traditional outreach methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:21:21:00">[1:21:21:00]</a>.
*   **Prepared Mind:** While some argue against it, having a "prepared mind" — deep knowledge and thesis in specific market areas — allows for more targeted and insightful engagement with companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:21:51:00">[1:21:51:00]</a>.

Overall, whether in [[Entrepreneurship and decisionmaking | entrepreneurship]] or venture capital, successful decision-making appears to blend deep reflection, independent thought, a willingness to take calculated risks, and a continuous pursuit of understanding both internal motivations and external realities.

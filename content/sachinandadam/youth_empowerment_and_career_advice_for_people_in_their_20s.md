Peter Corbett, a partner at Deloitte Monitor and head of Monitor Deloitte in Sydney, emphasizes the importance of youth empowerment and offers significant [[lessons_and_advice_for_young_professionals_in_their_20s | advice for young professionals in their 20s]] and [[networking_and_career_advice_for_university_students | advice for university students]] [00:39:21]. His insights are shaped by personal experiences, including growing up with hardworking parents and grandparents, and a tragic personal loss that underscored the importance of empathy and grace [00:01:42]-[00:04:41].

## Core Mantras and Life Lessons

Peter's core mantra is to "work hard but also be nice to people" [00:01:26]-[00:01:30]. This philosophy was deeply influenced by his grandparents, including a World War II veteran who worked four jobs to put his daughters through private school, and his parents, who are doctors and academics [00:01:42]-[00:03:17].

A pivotal experience for Peter was the suicide of a high school friend during his early days at Deloitte [00:03:46]-[00:03:59]. This event made him realize that "a lot going on in people's lives that are behind the scenes" [00:04:25]-[00:04:28], reinforcing the need for grace and the understanding that one may not always have all the information about another person's circumstances [00:04:28]-[00:04:41].

The corporate world is evolving to be flatter and more open, influenced by [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_advice | startup culture]] [00:05:26]-[00:05:40]. Peter strives to maintain an open-door policy to foster an effective work environment and help people reach their potential [00:05:48]-[00:06:03].

## A Strategic Approach to Your 20s

Peter applies the principles of business strategy to personal life, drawing from a framework called the "cascade of choices" [00:13:46]-[00:13:48]:

*   **Ambition/Aspiration** What do you want to do, and how do you define "winning" for yourself? This is increasingly purpose-driven rather than solely financial [00:13:50]-[00:14:20].
*   **Where to Play** Given your aspiration, which "customers," "channels," "markets," or "products" will you use? In personal terms, what problems do you want to solve, and with what kind of people do you want to work? [00:14:26]-[00:14:35], [00:15:50]-[00:15:56].
*   **How to Win** What is your unique value proposition? How do you personally show up? [00:14:44]-[00:15:02], [00:15:56]-[00:15:58].
*   **Capabilities** What strengths, activities, processes (courses, skills, people you meet) do you need to develop to achieve your winning position? [00:15:04]-[00:15:14], [00:16:10]-[00:16:14].
*   **Management Systems** What systems do you put in place to measure your progress and ensure you are on track to achieve your goals? [00:15:18]-[00:15:20], [00:16:16]-[00:16:22].

This framework allows individuals to create a cohesive narrative for their future [00:16:25]-[00:16:33].

## Advice for Young People and Career Choices

Peter's article, "25 for 25," distills his best [[lessons_and_advice_for_young_professionals_in_their_20s | advice for people in their early 20s]] [00:39:33]-[00:40:01]. A key thesis is "not to waste your twenties" [00:40:45]-[00:40:47]. He cites Dr. Meg Jay, who argues that "30 is not the new 20" and outlines three core concepts:

1.  **Create Identity Capital** Do something that invests in what you might be next [00:41:03]-[00:41:06]. This involves forming what your identity is and what you want to be [00:44:59]-[00:45:03].
2.  **Expand Your Network** Look beyond your closest friends, as jobs and future partners often arise from broader circles [00:41:09]-[00:41:14].
3.  **Start Picking Your Family Now** Even if you don't settle down, your 20s are a good time to work on relationships as if you were married [00:41:18]-[00:41:26].

Key takeaways from this advice include:
*   **Clarity of Purpose** Be clear on what is important to you [00:41:55]-[00:41:57]. Taking time to reflect on this will guide your future aspirations [00:42:04]-[00:42:12].
*   **Form Habits** Create positive habits, such as incorporating fitness into your life, to extend life and enhance daily performance [00:42:17]-[00:42:42].

### Navigating the Job Market

Given the high youth unemployment rate, Peter advises university students graduating to "just try" and "hustle" to secure their first jobs [00:40:16]-[00:40:24], [00:44:02]-[00:44:05]. This means putting yourself out there and doing the work, even if there isn't an immediate reward, to gain experience and build [[reflections_on_education_and_careers | identity capital]] [00:44:46]-[00:45:10]. The reality of the job market often requires significant effort, including numerous applications and interviews [00:45:27]-[00:45:36].

While some believe the 20s are a time solely for diverse experiences before settling down, Peter suggests that a strategic view of your 20s and diverse experiences are not in conflict [00:45:58]-[00:46:23]. One can explore many things while also making "pretty solid bets" in their career and identity capital [00:46:26]-[00:46:33]. The crucial aspect is to avoid reaching your 30s without having made investments in core skills or a core vocation, as this can lead to significant challenges [00:46:40]-[00:47:16]. Building "clearly bankable skill sets" in your 20s is vital for future success [00:48:01]-[00:48:05].

## Why Consulting?

Peter's motivation for staying in consulting, particularly at a large firm like Deloitte, is multi-faceted:
*   **Helping Others** He enjoys giving advice that helps people pursue fruitful careers or guides companies with confidence [00:48:38]-[00:48:52].
*   **Scale and Impact** Working at a global firm like Deloitte allows him to tackle complex problems that can affect an entire country, something not possible in a niche field or as a sole entrepreneur [00:48:59]-[00:49:29]. [[consulting_as_a_springboard_for_future_opportunities | Consulting]] also offers opportunities to work with diverse and talented individuals, from recent graduates to eminent experts [00:49:34]-[00:50:02].

## Final Advice

Peter reiterates his core mantra: "Work hard and be nice" [00:52:31]-[00:52:32]. Additionally, he advises to "always be curious" and consistently "ask the next why question" [00:52:44]-[00:52:48]. This approach has led to interesting conversations, helped solve difficult problems, and has never failed him [00:52:53]-[00:52:59].

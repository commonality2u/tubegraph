Alicia McDonald, a partner at AirTree Ventures, attributes much of her unique perspective, resilience, and personal drive to her childhood experiences, particularly growing up with a chronically ill mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. These early life challenges profoundly shaped her approach to work, [[personal_growth_and_selfawareness | self-awareness]], and life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Impact of Early Life Challenges
McDonald's mother suffered a grand mal seizure when Alicia was two, leading to a brain cancer diagnosis at 31 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Despite being given six months to live at one point, her mother survived but faced long-term complications, including paralysis, speech issues, epilepsy, and eventually, brain damage from radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This constant battle with illness throughout McDonald's childhood instilled in her a profound sense of [[impact_of_early_life_challenges_on_career_drive | perspective]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

> "It just puts into perspective like the things that I deal with that are stresses in my life are minuscule compared to what she dealt with at my age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

This upbringing taught her that many everyday stresses are "mostly water off a duck's back" and that much worse things could happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Cultivating Resilience and Drive
Her mother's incredible resilience and determination to survive and see her children grow up served as a powerful source of strength for McDonald <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This constant exposure to struggle instilled in her a profound understanding that "so much of life is suffering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

McDonald describes herself as a highly driven and ambitious person who gets satisfaction from achieving a lot and keeping busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. She thrives in high-pressure environments and easily gets bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This drive is partly an intrinsic desire for [[personal_growth_and_selfawareness | self-actualization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a> and also a sense of obligation to honor her mother's legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

> "I feel a big obligation to achieve as much as I can in my life and be as happy as I possibly can be, kind of to honor her legacy and all the sacrifices that she made for us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

Her career drive is internal, not seeking external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, and she genuinely enjoys her work in technology and with people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

## Core Values and Philosophy
McDonald values authenticity, striving not to project an image that doesn't represent who she truly is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. She deeply cares about the impact of her actions on others and possesses a natural sense of empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. Her definition of success is not just winning, but winning as a team without leaving a "trail of destruction, broken relationships, broken trust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

Her personal values, deeply rooted in her childhood, include:
*   **Authenticity:** Not trying to be something she's not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>.
*   **Achievement:** A desire to achieve as much as possible in life, avoiding an "average life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.
*   **Family:** Being a good parent is profoundly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.
*   **Empathy:** Thinking deeply about how her actions impact others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.
*   **Impact:** Focusing on the lasting positive impact she leaves on people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.
*   **Happiness and Gratitude:** Maintaining a positive outlook, being grateful for life's blessings, and appreciating every moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>.

She maintains a high level of [[selfdevelopment_and_selfawareness | self-confidence]], stemming from her parents' unwavering belief in her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>. This solid internal base allows her to embrace feedback as a tool for improvement without questioning her self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>.

## Balancing Career and Family
As a partner at a VC fund with three children, McDonald emphasizes the importance of a full life outside of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. AirTree Ventures itself values "more to life," supporting a culture where personal lives are respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:18">[00:49:18]</a>.

Her advice for young ambitious women who want both a fulfilling career and family life includes:
*   **Find what you love before having children:** You won't be "desperate to come back" to a job you don't love after maternity leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>.
*   **Work for the right company:** One whose values align with your own, especially regarding [[personal_growth_and_work_life_balance | work-life balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>.
*   **View childcare as a shared household cost:** Don't calculate it against only one partner's salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.
*   **Focus on outputs, not "Facetime"**: Hire great people, trust them to do a good job, and measure them on results, allowing flexibility in how they achieve their tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>.

Her own long-standing relationship with her husband, built on a foundation of friendship and shared values, also provides critical support for navigating a demanding career and raising a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>. This deep alignment on long-term values, especially regarding parenting, helps partners support each other through demanding periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>.

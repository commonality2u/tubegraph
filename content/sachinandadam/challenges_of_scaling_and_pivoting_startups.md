On Deck, co-founded by David Booth, rose to prominence as one of the world's largest education companies, making significant waves with its community-focused product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:07">[01:29:07]</a>. The company helped launch over a thousand businesses and raised more than $100 million to support its ambitious goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Rapid Growth and Initial Success
On Deck's rapid growth was significantly influenced by being in the "right place at the right time" during the early pandemic era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. With the world shifting to remote work and a heightened need for connection and learning, On Deck's community product boomed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. The company leveraged these tailwinds, quickly pivoting from in-person experiences to virtual cohorts just as the pandemic became a mainstream concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

The initial success of On Deck was built on the idea that in a world breaking around them, entrepreneurs needed to "run to the opportunity to help people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This led to:
*   **Community Building** On Deck fostered communities for founders, helping them find co-founders, friends, and advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Expanding Offerings** Recognizing that founders also needed capital, distribution, and talent, On Deck built adjacent communities like On Deck Angels, the ODX accelerator, and cohorts for specific roles (Engineers, Product Managers, Designers, Marketers, Chiefs of Staff) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. They even created cohorts for people in specific industries like healthcare and deep tech, who might not self-identify as founders but could be future co-founders or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   **Reimagining Education** On Deck's vision was to "return the community to the classroom," emphasizing that learning outcomes come from experience, relationships, and mutual achievement within a cohort, rather than just content consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. This established On Deck as a new form of "credential that draws in ambitious people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

David Booth described this period as a "wild roller coaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>, with revenue growing from a couple of million to $20 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. The company accepted $100 million from Tiger Global, part of a trend where capital was seen as "free and endless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. This investment allowed them to scale rapidly, growing their team from five pre-pandemic to 200 people, spread across 40 countries, without ever meeting in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. This was driven by the "Blitzscaling" mantra of Silicon Valley â€“ a "land grab" where rapid scaling was essential to outperform competitors offering similar cohort-based courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## Market Shifts and Downsizing
The "wisdom or the advice around you has a habit of changing quite quickly with the market conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. On Deck experienced significant [[Challenges and strategies in startup culture | challenges]] and had to pivot in early 2022 due to three main factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>:
1.  **Return to In-Person Interaction** The rollout of vaccines allowed people to return to in-person gatherings, reducing the demand for digital communities and online courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. The "oversaturation of digital community" meant people no longer wanted to spend hours on Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
2.  **Economic Downturn** The collapse of the crypto and tech bubbles in May 2022 led to a significant shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Companies cut their learning and development budgets, and consumer discretionary spending dried up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
3.  **Company Structure** On Deck's ambition led them to build many different communities (37 at peak) and three distinct business units (careers, recruiting, startups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. The startups unit had foregone revenue in favor of raising a large fund, assuming management fees would cover costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. However, when LP capital commitments dried up, the fund size and management fees were no longer sufficient to justify the large operating organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

This led to significant downsizing through multiple layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. The team scaled down from 350 people to around 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Some business units were spun out, with teams taking cash to build independently, or splitting off to create new companies, like the talent team forming a careers company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

## Evolving the Culture and Future Direction
Navigating the downsizes was challenging, with the second round of layoffs being particularly difficult, compounded by the tragic death of a laid-off team member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. David emphasizes the importance of evolving culture during these periods, moving from scaling up to scaling down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

On Deck eventually scaled back to focus on three core business bets:
*   A "LinkedIn for ambitious people," a directory product for finding individuals with specific skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   A recruiting marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
*   A small fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

The company recognized the need to return to its roots of building relationships and networking, specifically anchoring back to San Francisco as a "Nexus of capital and experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. The current model involves intensive in-person cohorts, like a week-long retreat with 120 experienced or aspiring founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This focus on strong connections and peer support remains a key value proposition.

This experience significantly developed David Booth's "capacity for constructively navigating chaos" and leadership skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. The journey highlighted the importance of anticipating market shifts and making strategic decisions to preserve a company's core mission and culture through difficult times.

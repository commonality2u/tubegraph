Duncan Anderson is recognized as a "hyper learner" with a "crazy growth mindset" who is constantly learning about himself and the world around him. He is the co-founder of Edrolo, an edtech startup aimed at improving education by providing resources to secondary schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Anderson believes that his mind is his ultimate creation and that he actively "builds" himself each day, aspiring to be materially different than he was at 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Early Career and the Love of Learning

Initially, Anderson's motivation was to achieve good grades, secure a high-paying job, and retire as soon as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. This led him to roles at [[Mark Carnegies career in high finance and private equity | Goldman Sachs]] and then a hedge fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. While at Goldman Sachs, he discovered a genuine "love of learning" by engaging with the financial markets, moving beyond simply aiming for good grades or promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This marked a significant shift in his perspective on work and personal growth. He realized that work could be "interesting and good for the world," a combination he eventually deemed "better than retirement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

Anderson's learning philosophy is to "type on that string" of whatever interests you, as one curiosity often leads to another. This approach allowed him to expand his knowledge from individual stocks to broader economic concepts, politics, and geopolitics, eventually delving into philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. He distinguishes between "studying," which he found draining, and "learning," which he describes as energizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Transition to Startups: The Five Pillars Strategy

While at a hedge fund, Anderson became an accidental tech analyst due to his interest in products like the iPhone. He recognized the potential of the App Store and the rise of startups, leading him to realize that companies could grow from small to big and have a positive global impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

To prepare for starting his own venture, Anderson identified five "key pillars" essential for a successful startup:
1.  Sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>
2.  CFO/Financial aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>
3.  Operations/Consulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>
4.  Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>
5.  Engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>

He strategically moved to Google, securing a role in their strategy and sales operations division, which functioned like internal management consulting. This move was intended to gain experience in another of the five pillars and to meet people interested in startups and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

### The Non-Transferability of Big Company Skills to Startups

Anderson observed that skills acquired at large companies like Goldman Sachs and Google were not easily transferable to startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. He uses a model of innovation:
*   **Zero to One Innovation**: Creating something entirely new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **One to Ten Innovation**: Making significant improvements to an existing, poorly working product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Ten Plus Innovation**: Performing small optimizations or scaling existing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

He explains that junior roles in big companies primarily involve "ten plus" innovation, which differs significantly from the "zero to one" or "one to ten" innovation required in startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. For those interested in startups, he recommends joining a Series A company (typically 30-50 people) to gain more relevant experience, as skills from large corporations are often less valuable for nascent ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

## Founding Edrolo

The idea for Edrolo emerged from a conversation with Benze, a former colleague from Goldman Sachs, who proposed a two-sided tutoring marketplace via Skype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. Anderson countered with the idea of "YouTube for VCE or YouTube for HSC," believing it to be a better business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

Instead of immediately quitting their jobs, they committed to 10 hours a week and $10,000 each to test the concept, working on it in the evenings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. This gradual approach allowed them to figure out critical aspects like website development, content creation, digital marketing, and company incorporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. The initial mission of Edrolo was to democratize access to great teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

## Edrolo's Evolution and Impact on Education

Edrolo's strategy evolved significantly from its initial "YouTube for VCE/HSC" model, which achieved high traction in Victoria (97% of schools, over 80% market share in subjects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. The company shifted its focus to becoming a "core resource" within classrooms, aiming to create the "new generation textbook" by combining their video content with traditional textbook elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This pivot was driven by the desire to influence the maximum amount of time students spend learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

### Core Philosophy and Approach

Anderson believes that nearly any subject can be made interesting or boring, and Edrolo's job is to create resources that elicit "love" or "like" from students, rather than dislike or hate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of making content easy to understand and relevant to students' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

Edrolo differentiates itself from traditional publishers through:
*   **In-house Content Creators**: All content creators are full-time employees, unlike traditional publishers who often use part-time teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.
*   **Extensive Research and Development**: Edrolo spends 6 months on R&D before 6 months of building a resource, significantly more than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>. This involves academic research, prototyping, and analyzing existing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>.
*   **Focus on Mental Models and Innovation**: Edrolo incorporates mental models into every core unit of learning across math, science, and humanities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. They aim to systematically build students' "innovation ability" by presenting problems in varied structures to prevent rote learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. For example, in math, they use extensive vocabulary banks and change the structure of word problems to encourage deeper understanding rather than mere memorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.

### Challenges in Scaling Edrolo

Despite its success, Edrolo faces significant scaling challenges because neither its "product" nor its "acquisition" scale easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>:
*   **Product Scaling**: Content for one curriculum (e.g., Year 12 math in Victoria) cannot be directly sold for another (e.g., Year 12 math in New South Wales), requiring continuous content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.
*   **Acquisition Scaling**: Selling to schools primarily requires enterprise sales, which does not scale as rapidly as bottom-up adoption seen in other tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.

However, controlling content production in-house ensures quality and prevents misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.

## Vision for Education and the Future

Anderson believes education is crucial for human development, aiming to increase the percentage of people who can "upgrade themselves" from about a third in developed countries to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. He views this as a "race against the machines," as repetitive jobs are increasingly automated, making the ability to learn new things and engage in non-repetitive tasks vital to avoid a "useless class" and societal breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.

He contends that existing education systems can be significantly improved through better, more engaging resources, without necessarily needing new curriculums, more money, or different teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. The goal is to make learning fascinating and interesting, allowing students to develop a "love of learning" and teach themselves new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

Anderson's personal vision has shifted from early retirement to working until he dies, focusing on problems that are interesting and rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>. He sees his work on Edrolo as a "meaningful life hack" by contributing to making the world better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:23">[00:47:23]</a>. He aims to maintain the interest and reward in his work while reducing the extraordinary stress often associated with startup life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.

### Key Learnings and Philosophies

[[Duncan Andersons growth mindset and learning | Duncan Anderson]]'s journey has solidified several core beliefs:
*   **Growth Mindset**: He firmly believes that the mind is not fixed but can be grown and become "wiser each day" through continuous effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.
*   **Methods for Growth**: He identifies reading, thinking, talking, writing, and building as key activities for mental growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
*   **Motivation**: The more one knows about something, the more interesting it becomes; the better one is at something, the more rewarding it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.
*   **Importance of Writing**: He views writing as "high quality thinking" because it externalizes thoughts, overcoming the mind's limited working memory and clarifying complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.
*   **Ease of Use (UX)**: A significant realization for Anderson is that people generally choose the "easiest thing to do." Therefore, a resource that offers a "medium improvement" with "minimum effort" is often adopted more widely than one offering a "large improvement" with "high effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>.
*   **Recharge Activities**: He emphasizes the importance of meditation and writing down thoughts to clear the mind and improve sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>.

## Future Endeavors

If he were to start another business, Anderson would focus on helping preschool-aged children with literacy. He believes literacy is foundational, as "words are inheritance from past generations" and knowledge work is the future. Improving literacy outcomes early on can significantly impact a child's future, as everything else, including math, is "downstream" from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

Emil Michael, an Egyptian-born American businessman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, served as the Senior Vice President of Business and Chief Business Officer at Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. During his tenure from 2013 to 2017, Uber was the fastest-growing company in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. His story at the company is even depicted in the TV show *Super Pumped* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Michael was renowned as a master negotiator who raised billions of dollars for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Joining Uber

Michael initially met Travis Kalanick in 2011, when Uber was a nascent company with only about eight employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>. At that time, Michael viewed Uber as merely a "black car service for rich people" and did not see it as a mission he could be passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. His perspective shifted dramatically a year later with the launch of Uber X <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>. This innovation made him realize it was "an every car service for everybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>, as many people could drive their own cars for extra income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a> and everyone wanted a reliable ride by pushing a button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. He then contacted Kalanick, and they spent nights mapping out their joint mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.

Kalanick saw Michael's intense dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a> and broad skill set, appreciating his willingness to tackle any challenging problem, from legal settlements to real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>. Michael initially had no defined role or direct reports, but he and Kalanick were both willing to take risks and shared an ambition to "conquer the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.

## Fundraising and Negotiations

Michael's expertise in fundraising became crucial despite Kalanick initially thinking he wouldn't need help in that area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>. Uber conducted six financing rounds in 20 months, growing from a valuation of $350 million to $70 billion in 24-30 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.

Michael employed a transparent and honest approach to fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:
*   He would tell investors the target amount and state that the valuation would be decided by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.
*   He would solicit bids from many investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   He would intentionally choose the second-best bid to ensure the deal closed and was slightly oversubscribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   He guaranteed full allocation to all but the last party in the deal, avoiding gamesmanship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>.

This straightforward method built trust, as he always delivered on his promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>. He attributes his negotiation skills to a combination of high emotional intelligence (EQ) and intellect (IQ), seeking to understand the other party's motivations and the "math" of how everyone can win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. He honed his negotiation skills over years, combining active listening with thorough research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>.

## Challenges and Doubts

During his time at Uber, Michael never doubted the mission until venture capitalists attempted to remove Kalanick in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>. He feared the company would fail if leadership lacked the necessary "fire and ambition" given the intense "ride sharing wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>. He noted that without their fierceness, Uber Eats, for example, lost a significant lead after Kalanick's departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.

Uber also faced significant regulatory and legal challenges in various countries, with governments enforcing "silly rules to the maximum extent possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>. Employees sometimes faced arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>. Despite these risks, Michael maintained that individuals had to decide if they were willing to take them, as employees were often deeply committed to bringing Uber's service to their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

## [[the_influence_of_ubers_work_culture_and_leadership | Work Culture and Hiring Philosophy]]

Michael actively combatted the "Silicon Valley bubble" mentality where people in tech might believe only those within the industry are intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. He made a conscious effort to hire diverse talent, including individuals who never attended college or veterans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.

His hiring philosophy focused less on pedigree and more on core qualities:
*   **Confidence and Humility**: The ability to be confident without experience while also being humble enough to learn and take advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.
*   **Self-awareness**: Candidates needed to understand their strengths and weaknesses and demonstrate a commitment to continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   **Hard Work and Raw Intellect**: These foundational traits were crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

Michael personally conducted three interviews a day, five days a week, for four yearsâ€”totaling approximately 1,800 interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>. He kept meticulous notes on every person to build a diverse network of talented individuals from all walks of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>. Through this process, he found that "talent is everywhere," although a strong work ethic was less universally distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

## Post-Uber Ambition and Personal Life

After his intense career at Uber, Michael experienced "post-deal depression," a common phenomenon where the adrenaline fades after a major project ends, leading to a feeling of not being useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. To fill this void, he focused on personal ambitions, including moving his parents, getting married, and having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

While he doesn't advise others to postpone personal life for career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>, he admits he was "loving" his work so much at the time that there wasn't room for anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. Since leaving Uber, he has redirected his professional ambition into investing, advising, and coaching entrepreneurs, aiming to guide others as Bill Campbell once coached him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.

Having a family has brought him profound joy, fulfilling a biological human desire to nurture young life and find gratification in shared experiences, unlike the ephemeral satisfaction of career achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>.

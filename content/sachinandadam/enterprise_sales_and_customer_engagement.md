Effective enterprise sales and customer engagement are crucial for scaling a business, particularly when targeting large organizations. The CEO emphasizes the importance of direct interaction, deep empathy, and a strategic approach to market entry and growth.

## Strategic Location: New York for Enterprise Sales
New York City serves as a critical hub for enterprise sales due to its concentration of major company headquarters globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Being physically present in New York means being amidst the energy and opportunity, offering a significant advantage in serving enterprise customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

For Enterprise sales, physical presence is often expected by clients, as competitors are likely in their offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>. Not being present can instantly put a company at a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>. There is also a perception that a company based outside of key markets, like Australia, might struggle with support for large businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>. This requires significant travel for a CEO to close deals and make things happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>.

## Principles of Enterprise Sales
Success in enterprise sales relies on deep [[Empathy and Leadership in Venture Capital | empathy]] for the customer's problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:00">[23:27:00]</a>. Sales is less about selling and more about solving problems with clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:45:00">[23:45:00]</a>.

Key principles include:
*   **Subject Matter Expertise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:00">[23:53:00]</a>: Investing heavily in experts who have deep empathy and can solve complex customer problems, such as former chief people officers or workforce strategists from major companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>.
*   **Compliance and Certifications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>: For companies working with large organizations (government, banks, professional services, retailers) that have strict data privacy and cyber security requirements, obtaining certifications like SOC 1, SOC 2, and ISO is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>. Without these, time and resources can be wasted in sales cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>.

### Shortening Sales Cycles
Enterprise sales cycles can be long, historically around 12 months, but efforts are made to reduce them to five months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:59:00">[24:59:00]</a>. A key strategy is "land, expand, explode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>. This involves:
1.  **Landing**: Entering by solving a specific problem for a key area of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:23:00">[25:23:00]</a>.
2.  **Expanding**: Growing within the organization by demonstrating value in a less expensive way that doesn't flag as a high risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>.
3.  **Exploding**: Focusing on net revenue retention and expanding services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32:00">[25:32:00]</a>. This approach is particularly relevant when companies are reconsidering software spending and are hesitant to invest large sums upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>.

## Customer Engagement and Distribution
Direct engagement with customers is highly motivating for a CEO, especially when facing daily challenges in a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>. Spending significant time with both incoming and current customers is a top priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:01]</a>.

[[Sales tactics and building distribution leverage | Distribution]] is considered the hardest part of building a company, and it can be achieved through:
*   **Organic Content Creation**: Producing a lot of educational, authentic, and authoritative content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:33:00">[32:33:00]</a>. This involves teaching about the new category the company is building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:35:00">[32:35:00]</a>.
*   **"Building in Public"**: Sharing the behind-the-scenes journey of building the company, including personal life aspects like raising children while working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:45:00">[32:45:00]</a>. This helps scale the parasocial relationship where people buy from those they know and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:20:00">[33:20:00]</a>.
*   **Community Building**: Giving away high-value, unique IP and content for free over an extended period (e.g., 18 months) to create a loyal community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>. This community can then be listened to for product development and monetized later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a>. This strategy can generate leads, reducing the need for early [[Fundraising and business growth strategies | funding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:56:00">[30:56:00]</a>. The CEO's own content strategy involves her daughters, making them part of the company's story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:47:00">[33:47:00]</a>.

## Workforce Strategy and AI
A significant problem in large organizations is the lack of understanding of their own workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Companies often don't know their employees' skills, potential, or current workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. There's also a lack of clarity on the actual tasks involved in jobs, beyond just job titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. The goal is to solve the problem of moving the right work to the right worker, whether it's a full-time employee, a consultant, or an [[AI agents and their practical applications in business | AI agent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.

AI is transforming how companies can be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>. The focus is on embracing AI boldly while being responsible to ensure no one is left behind in the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. The company aims to be one of the first enterprise startups to achieve a billion-dollar valuation with under 100 people by using a completely different workforce strategy leveraging AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. This approach has already resulted in significant savings, such as $1.5 million a month through AI adoption in areas like go-to-market, customer support, and product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>.

This [[Strategic approach to AI and machine learning in customer support | strategic approach to AI and machine learning in customer support]] and workforce optimization allows organizations to do more with less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>. The company aims to help customers navigate this new world by co-creating solutions, as the future jobs and impact of AI are still unknown even to AI companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. The mission is to create a world with zero waste of potential by reskilling individuals into meaningful work rather than just eliminating jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.

This understanding informed the development of an AI platform that understands jobs at a task and skill level, allowing for the strategic movement of work to workers based on company needs and economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>. This capability is described as "Workforce intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.

Individuals change through a combination of their habits and their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. Environment encompasses factors like cultural attitudes, physical location, and the people one associates with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

## Exchange as a Catalyst for Change
An exchange program, such as the six months spent in Utrecht, Netherlands, provided an immense opportunity for [[changing_beliefs_and_personal_growth | personal change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. This unique environment led to significant personal development by:
*   **Complete Freedom and Independence** For one of the hosts, it was their first time living away from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, necessitating a crash course in adult responsibilities, albeit a messy one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
*   **Exposure to Diverse Cultures** Interacting with people from various nationalities like California, New York, Spain, Ireland, and Canada broadened perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Friendships** The exchange environment fostered an extroverted and open community, where making new friends was a natural part of daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Friendships developed rapidly due to frequent socialisation and shared experiences like travelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Increased Confidence** The need to step out of one's [[personal_and_professional_growth_through_coaching | comfort zone]] by constantly interacting with new people significantly boosted confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. This experience helped individuals, including those who were initially socially anxious, to overcome their fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
*   **Adopting New Habits** Living in a new physical location made it easier to adopt different daily routines and habits, such as experimenting with diet, exercise, and meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, including the practice of cold showers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### The Role of Social Environment
The people one spends time with are a critical component of the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.
*   **Converging Personalities** Shared experiences and a consistent environment can lead to noticeable convergence in personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.
*   **Influence on Aspirations and Mood** Spending time with individuals who have specific aspirations, such as pursuing a corporate career, can subconsciously influence one's own desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. The mood and energy levels of those around you can also significantly impact one's own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
*   **Conscious Choices** After high school, one host consciously chose to spend time with friends who had positive energy, leading to a happier social group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.
*   **Individual Susceptibility** While some individuals remain unaffected by their social environment, others are highly influenced, absorbing characteristics from both low-energy and high-energy people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.

## Returning Home: Suppressed Changes
Upon returning to a familiar environment, previously developed changes can be suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. The expectation that friends would also have changed due to the unique experience of exchange proved to be incorrect, as they had remained in the same environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. To sustain significant [[changing_beliefs_and_personal_growth | personal change]], it is crucial to align one's environment with new habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

## Self-Awareness and Personal Standards
The process of [[changing_beliefs_and_personal_growth | personal growth]] can also bring challenges, particularly with increased [[the_role_of_values_and_self_reflection_in_personal_and_business_growth | self-awareness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Being constantly aware of one's mental state can lead to self-criticism, especially for individuals with high personal standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. The key is to find a balance between continuous improvement and self-acceptance, recognising that one does not always need to be in a "good state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

It is important to define one's own standards and values rather than comparing oneself to others or societal expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. A useful exercise for defining personal values involves imagining one's own funeral and considering what one would want others to say about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. This helps in discerning what truly matters amidst the vast amount of information and perspectives available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

Ellie Hansen, a principal investor at Side Stage Ventures, brings a unique blend of experiences to her role, having traversed the highest points of advertising, founded multiple consumer companies, and now investing in early-stage ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>. Her diverse career offers valuable insights into the [[the_journey_and_mindset_of_being_a_visionary_and_an_entrepreneur | journey and mindset of being a visionary and an entrepreneur]].

## Personal Philosophy and Core Traits

Hansen's upbringing instilled in her a defining ideology: "nothing's a jail sentence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:18">[06:49:18]</a>. This philosophy empowers her to make changes if she feels unfulfilled or off-track, emphasizing personal choice and the ability to steer one's life direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:19">[06:54:19]</a>. While she identifies herself as "stubborn," others, including her partner, might describe her as "easygoing" when it comes to major life decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:26">[03:00:26]</a>. She tends to "let life take its path" and seize opportunities as they arise, rather than forcing outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>. This contrasts with her desire to "curate" and "optimize for success" whatever is immediately in front of her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:11">[03:46:11]</a>.

## Early Life and Foundational Experiences

Her early life as a ballet dancer, attending an intense sports school, cultivated significant discipline and self-direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:07">[07:27:07]</a>. Training five days a week from 1 PM to 7 PM, while completing half her schooling through correspondence, taught her how to break down large goals into manageable pieces and fostered self-learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:05">[07:35:05]</a>. These experiences, including learning to prioritize tasks from a massive to-do list, were crucial in priming her for her later [[journey_from_employment_to_entrepreneurship | journey from employment to entrepreneurship]] as a founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:46">[08:00:46]</a>.

Growing up in an entrepreneurial family, where she packed orders in warehouses and learned about mergers and acquisitions from a small business perspective, also provided her with the mindset to question the status quo and proactively solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:04">[16:01:04]</a>.

## Career Trajectory and Growth

### Rapid Ascent at Ogilvy

Hansen's career in advertising, particularly at Ogilvy in New York City, was marked by rapid advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:24">[11:51:24]</a>. Despite not initially dreaming of a career in advertising and not knowing much about it, her lack of fear regarding being fired for her opinions allowed her to have "really creative ideas" and make a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:07">[12:53:07]</a>.

She intentionally traversed different departments at Ogilvy to gain a holistic understanding:
*   Started as an Artist in Residence, feeling disconnected from strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:58">[13:09:58]</a>.
*   Moved into customer experience design to understand customer journeys and problem definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:09">[13:17:09]</a>.
*   Transitioned to global management consulting to grasp business questions at a global scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:43">[13:29:43]</a>.

Her initiative, including numerous internal "customer research" coffees and volunteering for extracurricular projects, led to her co-leading the redesign of Ogilvy's global operating system at just 26 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:07">[13:57:07]</a>. This experience taught her immensely at a young age, but she eventually realized it wasn't her "dream job," despite her success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:12">[10:36:12]</a>.

### "This Is Not An Agency" (TINA) and the Entrepreneurial Pivot

After leaving Ogilvy and during her MBA, Hansen inadvertently founded "This Is Not An Agency" (TINA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:02">[18:03:02]</a>. This venture, which became an accidental incubator, arose from many founders seeking her advice on branding, packaging, and fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:06">[18:11:06]</a>. A key lesson from this period was the importance of asking oneself, "Can I do this myself?" before outsourcing tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:47">[18:44:47]</a>. This approach challenges the "imposter syndrome" that often leads founders to believe others will be better at tasks they could learn themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:59:02">[18:59:02]</a>.

## Insights on Brand Building and Startups

Hansen's background in design and advertising provided a crucial entry point into consumer startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:00">[21:57:00]</a>. She emphasizes that while branding and marketing are vital for storytelling in consumer brands, product quality and "consumer love" are equally, if not more, important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:36:31">[22:36:31]</a>.

### Advice for Building a Resonant Brand

For founders aiming to build a resonant brand, Hansen offers key [[advice_on_entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | advice on entrepreneurship and startup success]]:

*   **Embrace Imperfection:** "Don't let perfect be the enemy of good, and good be the enemy of done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:08">[24:03:08]</a>. Founders should prioritize getting their message out quickly, testing, and iterating based on feedback, rather than striving for initial perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:42">[24:22:42]</a>. Often, less polished work resonates more, especially in performance marketing, because it feels more honest and true to the brand or founder story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:33">[24:54:33]</a>.
*   **Understand Your Funnel:** Deeply understand and measure every data point in your marketing funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:09">[25:38:09]</a>. Identifying specific issues (e.g., click-through rate vs. bounce rate) allows for targeted A/B testing and iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:43">[25:52:43]</a>.
*   **Brand and Performance Marketing are Linked:** Performance marketing is not at odds with brand building; they are "inherently linked and inherently additive to each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:23">[27:00:23]</a>. A brand is every customer experience and expression, including social media, websites, and packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:14:04">[32:14:04]</a>.

### Standing Out in a Crowded Market

To stand out in a competitive market, founders must be "really clear on what your unique perspective is on the world and why you're doing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:18:12">[43:18:12]</a>. This requires a "human insight" â€“ a relatable truism about the human condition that evokes an "oh yeah, I've experienced that" reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:38:20">[43:38:20]</a>. Building a brand around such an honest insight allows it to resonate deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:57:04">[44:57:04]</a>.

### The Fear of Offending and Cultural Differences

Building a distinctive brand often requires courage, as it might "piss a lot of people off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:15:02">[46:15:02]</a>. Hansen notes that this fear of offending, coupled with Australia's "tall poppy syndrome," can make founders hesitant to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:30:16">[47:30:16]</a>. In contrast, the US market, with its larger population and "dog eat dog" competitive culture, may encourage more polarizing strategies to differentiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:21:00">[52:21:00]</a>. Australian advertising, ironically, has a history of being "very willing to be offensive" and is known for its humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:15:15">[49:15:15]</a>. However, the stakes are higher for founders putting their entire business on the line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:21:09">[50:21:09]</a>.

## Current Role as Investor at Side Stage Ventures

As an investor at Side Stage Ventures, Hansen feels she is "operating in my best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:26">[09:57:26]</a>. This role allows her to integrate her diverse experiences to help founders build their ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:03">[11:14:03]</a>. Side Stage Ventures employs a "founder-first approach," meaning every action, from participating in podcasts to investment decisions, is evaluated by whether it serves their founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:08:52">[58:08:52]</a>. This includes having nuanced and detailed conversations with founders, drawing from their own experiences of tough decisions in raising money and valuing their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:07:05">[59:07:05]</a>.

While this founder-first approach offers empathy, Hansen acknowledges potential "blind spots," such as over-empathizing with the difficulties faced by hardware founders due to personal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>. She recognizes that this might make her "less of a shark" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>.

The Australian venture ecosystem, unlike the US, is more collaborative among funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>. Side Stage aims to foster this collaboration and build a fund for the next 20-30 years, constantly iterating like a product and remaining "super customer-centric" to their founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>. This reflects a broader trend of [[transition_from_venture_capital_to_entrepreneurship | transition from Venture Capital to Entrepreneurship]].

## Future Outlook for Australian Consumer Market

Hansen expresses excitement about the Australian consumer market, noting that while direct-to-consumer (DTC) economics have shifted globally (higher customer acquisition costs), Australia has unique advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>. Successful Australian brands like Aesop and Zimmermann have demonstrated global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. There is a strong recognition and "reverence" for Australian lifestyle and design in the US market, creating a unique export opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. Furthermore, Australia's geographical location provides direct access to APAC markets, which US brands typically only consider at later stages of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>. This expansion beyond geographical limitations opens new possibilities for [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_advice | Venture scale returns]] in Australian consumer brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.

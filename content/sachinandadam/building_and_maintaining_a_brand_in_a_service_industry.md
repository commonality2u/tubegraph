## The Role of Brand in Scaling Services

In scaling service-based businesses, [[Branding and marketing strategies | brand]] plays a significant role, as exemplified by firms like McKinsey and Goldman Sachs, which have built lasting brands throughout history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. McKinsey, for instance, can charge premium rates (e.g., $500 an hour for an analyst) due to its strong [[Branding and marketing strategies | brand]], making it a "cover your ass" move for companies to hire them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. This highlights the financial advantage a strong [[Branding and marketing strategies | brand]] can provide, leading to "insane margins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

## Building Brand Through Service Delivery

In the early stages of a service business, it is generally "too difficult to think about [[Branding and marketing strategies | brand]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. New service companies are unlikely to win solely on [[Branding and marketing strategies | brand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Instead, success comes from the quality of service delivery, ensuring the customer "loves" the experience and finds it "nice [and] elegant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

A [[Branding and marketing strategies | brand]] typically emerges when a company scales to a significant revenue level, such as $50-100 million, and becomes known for a specific area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Historically, successful brands, including those like McKinsey, were not built by focusing on [[Branding and marketing strategies | brand]] in isolation, but by "delivering a great service for long periods of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## Brand as a Byproduct of Performance

The general principle for [[Building a consumer brand | building a consumer brand]] or any significant [[Branding and marketing strategies | brand]] is that it is a "byproduct" or "derivative of what you actually deliver" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. People who have built incredible brands did so because they "delivered incredible products consistently over long periods of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Similarly, athletes with incredible brands usually achieve them because of their performance, with rare exceptions like David Beckham, whose stardom may have "outshined his actual performance on the field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

## The Future of Taste and AI in Branding

The concept of [[Role of Design and Taste in Business | taste]] is seen as a significant factor in the evolving AI landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. There will be considerable value for individuals who can "direct models and direct AI to do things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. [[Role of Design and Taste in Business | Taste]] is expected to be a major leverage point when combined with the scale that AI offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

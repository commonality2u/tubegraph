Kirsten Hunter, co-founder and former CEO of Future Super, reflects on her diverse career path, highlighting her continuous effort to align her professional endeavors with her personal values and wellbeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. Her journey from medicine and law to consulting and eventually to leading an ethical superannuation fund demonstrates a deep commitment to purpose-driven work and a conscious effort to [[balancing_success_and_personal_fulfillment | balance success with personal fulfillment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.

## The Challenge of [[balancing_personal_intensity_and_maintaining_longevity_in_leadership | Personal Intensity]] and Burnout

Hunter's career, characterized by self-motivation and a drive to achieve, initially led to an intense work-life where even relaxation became "corporatized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">[02:12:12]</a>. This innate drive, present since her school days, meant she often provided her own structure and motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

However, this high-energy approach, especially in corporate environments, frequently resulted in burnout and stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. She observed that corporate settings tend to "suck whatever energy that you're willing to give them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:999">[05:20:999]</a>. A profound realization for her was that to perform effectively, she needed to manage her energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. This meant:
*   Giving herself permission to take breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
*   Taking mental health days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   Building in time for sleep and exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

While she experienced burnout as a lawyer at Freehills and a consultant at Bain, she had fewer instances at Future Super, partly due to having more control over shaping the environment and having learned crucial lessons about [[balancing_work_life_and_personal_wellbeing | managing personal energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. This learning process underscored the importance of not just maximizing work output but also maximizing overall happiness and wellbeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

## Early Influences: Social Justice and Community

Even in her earlier, more traditional roles, Hunter consistently sought opportunities to align her work with a sense of justice and community benefit:
*   **Student Politics:** During her university years, she took a year off to serve as president of the UNSW Union. This experience, particularly during the introduction of voluntary student unionism, ignited her interest in governance and the role of a company within a community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. She aimed to represent her faculty and contribute to the university community that had given her a sense of belonging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   **Pro Bono Work:** As a lawyer at Freehills, she actively participated in pro bono opportunities, notably representing a claimant in the Aboriginal Trust Fund Repayment Scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Witnessing the life-changing impact of her corporate skills when applied to community benefit was a profound experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   **Social Impact at Bain:** At Bain & Company, she continued her community involvement through social return on investment work with charities, organizing community impact days, and spearheading a global partnership with Girls20, an organization focused on empowering women and girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

Hunter describes this as a "two-tracked career" where her corporate day job ran parallel to her deeply motivated community work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## The Pivotal Shift: Parenthood and Future Super

A significant turning point came with parenthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. Two key changes occurred:
1.  **Time Constraint:** Returning to work part-time, she found it impossible to juggle her demanding corporate role with her volunteering efforts, leading to a waning of energy for the corporate side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This highlighted the difficulty of [[balancing_career_goals_with_personal_life_and_family | balancing career goals with personal life and family]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
2.  **Climate Change Realization:** While caring for her newborn, she read an IPCC report projecting mass wildfires, food shortages, and no coral reefs by 2040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. The realization that this future would impact her daughter's adult life profoundly shook her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

This moment led her to question why her "brain output" was primarily spent helping companies make money, with only a small portion dedicated to community impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. She decided this needed to be reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. This clarity prompted her to seek a role that would integrate her corporate skills with her passion for social and environmental change, leading her to Future Super <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

Future Super's mission is to build "a prosperous future free from climate change and inequality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Hunter joined as a late-stage co-founder, driven by the belief that the fund could not only provide an ethical investment option but also influence the broader financial sector towards more sustainable and equitable practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## Integrating Values: The "Corporate Entrepreneur" Approach

Hunter views her corporate experiences as invaluable, providing her with the skills necessary to lead Future Super <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. She describes herself as a "corporate entrepreneur," always looking for ways to improve the companies she worked for while engaging in community activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

At Future Super, she applied this mindset by:
*   **Addressing Gender Inequality:** Recognizing that women retire with 47% less superannuation than men, Future Super introduced policies within their own organization to address this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. These included higher super rates for lower earners, superannuation payments during parental leave, and full-time super payments for part-time carers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. These policies, disproportionately benefiting women, were later adopted by other companies, demonstrating the influence a smaller, values-driven organization can have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This exemplifies [[balancing_career_and_family_for_women_in_business | balancing career and family for women in business]].
*   **Transparency on Gender Pay Gap:** Following a question from a team member about their own gender pay gap, Future Super undertook a multi-year effort to analyze and reduce their internal gender pay gap, bringing it from 20% down to less than 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This commitment to transparency and action aligns with [[the_role_of_values_and_self_reflection_in_personal_and_business_growth | the role of values and self reflection in personal and business growth]].

Hunter emphasizes that young people have significant power to shape the companies they work for, encouraging them to "just ask" questions about company operations and ethical practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## A Vision for a Rebalanced Capitalism

Hunter believes that capitalism, in its current form, is "broken" because it rewards the wrong behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. Her utopian vision is a world where:
*   Profit does not come at the expense of people and the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   Profit is rewarded to individuals and companies that "do good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   There's a closer link between profitability and positive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   Behavior that damages the planet or creates inequality is punished through mechanisms like taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

She sees a new economic system as possible, driven by the younger generation's demand for ethically manufactured products and value-aligned investments, even if it means paying slightly more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. This shift, she notes, is exciting and transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

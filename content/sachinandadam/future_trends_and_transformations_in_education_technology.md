Duncan Anderson, co-founder of edtech startup Edrolo, is described as a "hyper learner" with a "crazy growth mindset" who is constantly learning about himself and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. His core philosophy revolves around the idea that one's mind is their ultimate creation and possession, and that individuals should strive to "build" and "level up" their minds daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This perspective has deeply influenced his career path and the mission of Edrolo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Duncan Anderson's Philosophy on Learning and Growth

Anderson believes that learning should be energizing rather than draining, contrasting it with traditional "studying" which can often feel like a chore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. His personal journey into loving learning began in his first job, where the content itself became interesting, rather than just a means to achieve good grades or promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. He advises others to "type on that string" – explore whatever interests them, as one curiosity often leads to another, expanding knowledge organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

He highlights "reading, thinking, talking, writing, building" as key activities for continuous self-improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. He views a person's character as something that can be forged and grown, not a fixed trait, aligning with a growth mindset rather than a fixed mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

## Challenges in the Current Education System

Anderson notes that traditional education curriculums are often perceived as boring by many students, leading to disengagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. A key issue he identifies is the prevalence of rote learning, where students memorize facts without true understanding, leading to a lack of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Edrolo's Mission and Approach

Edrolo's mission is to improve education by providing high-quality resources to secondary schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The core purpose is to help minds reach a point where they can "build themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Initially, Edrolo started as a two-sided tutoring marketplace, a "YouTube for VCE or HSC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. Over time, it shifted to become a core curriculum resource, essentially creating the "new generation textbook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>, including significant printed materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

The company focuses heavily on content quality to make resources easy to understand, interesting, and relevant to students' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. They believe that like a good novel, educational content can be so engaging that students "can't go to sleep" because they want to keep learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

Key aspects of Edrolo's approach:
*   **In-house content creation:** All content creators are full-time employees, ensuring quality control and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
*   **Extensive R&D:** They spend approximately six months on research and development before building resources, analyzing academic research, existing products, and prototyping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>.
*   **Integration of Mental Models:** Edrolo incorporates mental models (like those popularized by Charlie Munger) into every core unit of learning across math, science, and humanities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Fostering Innovation:** By systematically varying question structures and using diverse vocabulary (e.g., in math), they aim to prevent rote learning and encourage students to innovate and adapt their problem-solving approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>.

## Mental Models and Their Importance

Mental models are described as any way to help approach a problem more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Examples provided include:
*   **Small, Medium, Large:** Categorizing problems by their complexity to determine the effort required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   **Problem, Solution, How, Execution:** A framework for problem-solving abilities, ranging from executing given solutions to identifying the problem itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Zero-to-One, One-to-Ten, Ten-Plus Innovation:** Differentiating types of innovation based on novelty and scale of improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Bloom's Taxonomy:** A pyramid of learning objectives: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

Anderson suggests that individuals should actively collect and even create their own mental models, starting by learning existing ones and then modifying or combining them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

[[future_trends_in_the_technology_and_telecommunications_industry | Edtech]] is now the second-largest startup community in Australia, after fintech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. The first wave of edtech saw the rise of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) like Khan Academy and Udemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. The current and next wave focuses on specialized content and influencing the core learning time spent by students within schools, as well as before and after school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.

Duncan highlights a critical societal challenge related to the [[the_impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | impact of technology and AI on future industries and opportunities]]. He warns that all repetitive jobs, whether physical or mental, are increasingly being replaced by machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. This creates a "race against the machines" to ensure humans are upgraded to the point where they can either upgrade themselves or perform non-repetitive jobs, otherwise risking the emergence of a "useless class" requiring universal basic income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.

He believes the existing education system is the best mechanism to address this, aiming to increase the percentage of individuals who can self-upgrade (from about one-third in developed countries, according to Robert Keegan, to 90%, as per Jo Boaler) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.

Rather than advocating for new curriculums, more money, or different teachers—which he sees as difficult to implement due to political resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>—Anderson believes the focus should be on improving existing educational resources to make them interesting and foster innovation ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. He argues that this transformation can occur within the current system by making learning "delicious and nutritious" rather than boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Vision for Edrolo

A significant challenge for Edrolo is that its "product" (curriculum content) does not scale horizontally (e.g., Year 12 math in Victoria cannot be directly sold as Year 12 math in New South Wales due to curriculum differences) nor vertically (Year 7 content doesn't scale to Year 8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. Sales also require enterprise-level engagement with schools, which does not scale quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. Despite these challenges, Anderson believes the control over content quality from in-house creation offers significant benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.

Anderson's personal vision has evolved from wanting to retire early with financial wealth to dedicating his life to meaningful work that improves the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>. He sees education as a crucial tool for humanity's future, aiming to influence the majority of the "six hours a day of learning" young people spend in school through high-quality, engaging resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.

His ultimate goal is to make learning enjoyable and effective for all children, believing this is one of the key challenges to help humanity in the face of future technological changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. He also aims for a more sustainable approach to work, maintaining interest and reward without the intense stress often associated with startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.

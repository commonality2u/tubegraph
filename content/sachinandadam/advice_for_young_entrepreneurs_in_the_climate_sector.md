Alex Honnold, a renowned climber and advisor to the Australian VC firm Regen Ventures, shares insights on applying lessons from extreme sports to business, particularly for young entrepreneurs interested in the climate sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Bridging Climbing and Climate Investment

Honnold's engagement with climate investing stems from a natural appreciation for nature developed through rock climbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. His work with the Honnold Foundation on solar projects globally and his personal interest, driven by reading environmental non-fiction, led him to this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. He enjoys meeting founders who are acting on interesting ideas to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Lessons from Climbing for Entrepreneurship
Honnold believes that lessons from climbing can be applied to business, especially when tackling big challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Key takeaways include:
*   **Managing risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   **Thorough preparation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   **Devotion to a craft**: Spending 29 years striving to be the best climber has taught him that the pursuit of one thing for an extended period can translate to success in any field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

A common misconception about Honnold is that he feels no fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. He clarifies that his approach involves extensive training, practice, and preparation, which builds 100% confidence, thereby reducing fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This emphasizes that while risk and fear will always exist, greater preparation leads to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Focus Areas in Climate and Beyond
Honnold is personally passionate about solar and the broader energy transition to renewable energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. However, he also appreciates the passion of founders focusing on niche areas, such as seagrass, highlighting the diversity within the climate solution space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

His involvement in climate is primarily through the Honnold Foundation and his advisory role with Regen Ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. His main priorities remain climbing challenges and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## [[advice_for_young_australian_entrepreneurs | Advice for Young Australian Founders]]
For young Australian founders interested in the climate world, Honnold's primary advice is:
*   **"Just do it"**: If you have a good idea, act on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Embrace failure**: The worst outcome is failure, but it provides significant learning experiences for future ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Avoid inaction**: The truly worst thing is not starting at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Honnold notes a cultural difference where failure is viewed more negatively in Australia compared to America, where people are more encouraged to try again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. He emphasizes that ultimately, what matters is your eventual success and contributions, not the business ventures that failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Especially if young and passionate, he urges individuals to "do the thing" and "try" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

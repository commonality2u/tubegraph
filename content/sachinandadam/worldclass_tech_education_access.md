The primary mission of the organization is to ensure that every individual globally has access to a world-class tech education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Mission Approach

This mission is pursued through two main avenues:
*   **Content Creation** Initially, by creating high-quality tech education content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Enabling Creators** By [[enabling_tech_creators_in_asia | enabling the tech creators across Asia]] who are developing such content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

The organization itself has experience in [[tech_media_in_australia_and_asia_pacific | Tech media for Australia and Asia Pacific]], having run "The Satchin Adam Show" for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Driving Philosophy and Vision

A core belief underpinning this mission is that while talent is uniformly distributed, opportunity is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Recognizing that technology will be the world's leading force moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, and noting the substantial emerging middle-class populations in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, the goal is to empower these individuals.

Success is defined by enabling people to access content that inspires them, provides tools, and allows them to achieve their aspirations and participate in the new tech economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

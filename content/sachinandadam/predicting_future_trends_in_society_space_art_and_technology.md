Fred Schebesta is described as a true visionary who can sense trends before they occur and sees the world uniquely [00:00:31]. He lives more in the future than the present, constantly seeking patterns and programmed human behaviors [00:05:30]. His approach involves observing movements of people, particularly at the "edges of humanity"â€”those at the bottom striving to rise or those at the top resisting a fall [00:06:36].

## Core Principles for Identifying Trends

Schebesta's ability to predict trends is rooted in several core principles:
*   **Curiosity and Risk-Taking** He is inherently curious, willing to "cut cables" and take chances that others might not [00:04:17].
*   **Forward-Looking** He focuses on moving forward and figuring out how to reach the future, rather than dwelling on the past [00:05:24].
*   **Authenticity** From a young age, he felt like a "fraud" conforming to societal expectations [00:10:08]. He stopped doing things he disliked, even everyday chores, to focus entirely on what he loves and where he feels he can contribute most [00:11:47].
*   **"Memento Mori"** This Roman general's reminder, meaning "one day you will die," influences his daily decisions to ensure they align with his envisioned legacy [00:07:37].
*   **Energetic Alignment** He makes changes when he's not in his "highest energy space" or "flow," prioritizing his personal contribution and energy [00:08:41].
*   **Listening for Deviations** His primary method for identifying new trends is to listen for "tiny little variations and bumps of people's lives" [00:34:37]. When someone gets excited or mentions something "outside the standard deviation," it earns his attention to "remark about it" [00:37:07]. He advises leaning into these uncomfortable moments and exploring them deeply [00:35:47].

## Future Predictions and Ideas

If given $100 billion to spend in 10 days, Schebesta's primary investment would be in SpaceX [00:17:17]. He views space as the ultimate frontier, believing that further human exploration and presence in space will profoundly change our perception of reality and lead to advancements in survivability and universal management of our organic state [00:17:30]. For example, living on Mars could make us appreciate Earth's fragility more acutely [00:19:19]. He sees Earth's spirit as one of balance, capable of supporting fragile life despite its molten core [00:20:10].

### Humanity as a "Virus" and the Drive for Growth
Schebesta posits a thesis that humanity is fundamentally a "virus" because it is the only species that threatens to destroy its own planet [00:22:21]. This is attributed to an "undeniable desire for growth" and a "continuous dissatisfaction with our state of humanity" [00:24:29]. This constant drive, while helping humans rise to the top of the food chain, now necessitates expansion into space to hedge for survival and provide more resources [00:24:12].

### [[the_future_of_social_media_and_digital_interaction | The Future of Social Media and Digital Interaction]] and [[the_impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | The Impact of Technology and AI on Future Industries]]
Schebesta is highly optimistic about [[future_trends_in_the_technology_and_telecommunications_industry | technology]]'s future impact [00:26:06]. He believes humanity is "very, very close to going full metaverse" [00:26:39], a process accelerated by COVID-19 by 10 years [00:26:44]. The ability for people to earn more money in games like Axie Infinity than in the real world signifies a major shift [00:26:53]. This transition to the metaverse is expected to change the distribution of wealth and income in many societies [00:27:58].

### The Impact of AI and Universal Basic Income (UBI)
As [[the_impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | AI]] and robots become more prevalent, Schebesta forecasts the advent of Universal Basic Income (UBI) [00:29:05]. He compares this to the Renaissance, where human focus will shift from making money (which becomes a non-issue) to [[cultural_movements_and_market_trends | art and culture]] [00:29:16]. He predicts that within 25 years, actors will be among the wealthiest people in society, as automated tasks lead to increased boredom and a higher demand for entertainment [00:30:00]. This shift means that jobs related to simple, repetitive tasks will diminish, while creative fields will flourish [00:30:27].

### Environmentalism and Australia's Untapped Asset
Another significant shift will be the increasing value of environmentalism [00:31:45]. Jobs will pivot towards protecting nature, as it becomes harder to sustain naturally [00:31:51]. Schebesta believes Australia possesses an undervalued, untapped resource in its pristine, untouched environments [00:32:11]. Areas where no human has ever walked will become incredibly valuable assets in the future, especially as [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technology]] and travel become more commoditized [00:32:56].

## Overcoming Self-Limiting Beliefs
For young, aspiring leaders, Schebesta emphasizes a crucial life principle:
*   **Continuous Learning** Even when winning, one only knows about two percent of everything [00:51:21]. He encourages people to leave their "small pond" of comfort and continuously push themselves to find more, fostering purpose, direction, and velocity [00:51:38].
*   **Creating Purpose** Instead of waiting for purpose to manifest, he advises simply "making one up" [00:53:03]. This self-defined purpose should stretch beyond one's comfort zone, serving as a guiding intention that mitigates the impact of life's inevitable challenges [00:53:08].
*   **Addressing Self-Judgment** The feeling of not being happy in the moment despite progress often stems from self-limiting beliefs, such as not feeling "good enough" or "worthy" [00:54:43]. He suggests observing one's internal dialogue when things go wrong, contrasting it with the supportive language used when a child learns to walk [00:57:05]. By recognizing that this negative self-talk originates internally, one can begin to unpack and change these judgments, freeing oneself to feel amazing even while pursuing continuous growth [00:57:58].

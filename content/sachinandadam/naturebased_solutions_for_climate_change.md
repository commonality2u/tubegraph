## Personal Connection to Nature

Adam's wife, a zoologist, has a deep love for nature and animals, which has influenced his passion for this area over two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Together, they are very dedicated to this cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Canva's Approach to Giving Back

Canva was founded with the intention of being an organization that looks beyond just the bottom line and shareholder value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. It aims to provide value to everyone involved, from investors and customers to those indirectly affected by their choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This philosophy naturally leads the company to consider the planet and social equity and justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The organization is structured to facilitate effective giving back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Elizabeth Yin, co-founder of Hustle Fund, one of America's most well-known pre-seed funds, shares extensive insights from her career as an entrepreneur and her time at Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Her experience offers valuable lessons on [[building_a_successful_tech_startup | building a successful tech startup]], investing, and leading companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Driving Motivation: Empowering Founders
Elizabeth's core motivation stems from a desire to build a "huge business" that could be her life's work, something she would be excited to work on for 30-40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. She discovered her passion lay in supporting founders and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

Having been a founder herself, Elizabeth identified three major problems that many founders face:
1.  **Capital** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>
2.  **Knowledge** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>
3.  **Networks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>

Hustle Fund's mission is to empower great founders by providing access to these three critical elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## The Path to Entrepreneurship: Time and Place
Elizabeth does not believe being a founder is hereditary; rather, for her, it was a byproduct of "time and place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Growing up in Silicon Valley during the dot-com boom, she had opportunities to get involved with startups even as a high schooler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Her initial exposure to startups came in the fall of 1996, working for her best friend's cousin, Tony (the late Tony Hsieh, former CEO of Zappos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Despite not knowing what a startup was or how they made money, she was drawn to the "really cool creative energy" and chaos of the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This initial experience, leading to a significant acquisition by Microsoft, demonstrated the potential for big outcomes from seemingly chaotic beginnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Personal Traits and Superpowers
Elizabeth describes herself as an "underdog sorts" who thrives on "going and doing stuff and proving people wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This drive was fueled by experiences like an angel investor questioning her leadership capabilities due to her being a "Meek Asian woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

Her identified "superpower" is self-awareness: knowing where she has an "edge" and where she doesn't, allowing her to "play games" in areas where she can win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
Her specific strengths include:
*   **Frugality**: Being very resourceful in making things happen on a limited budget or time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This attribute is particularly helpful for starting a pre-seed fund where operations often have minimal funding for 10-15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   **Boldness**: Illustrated by taking an un-intended job in Tokyo, attempting to work in Japan with limited Japanese language skills, which she later described as "very bold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Learning from Experiences: Google and LaunchBit
Elizabeth's diverse early career, including internships in Switzerland, Japan, and India, shaped her perspective on [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_advice | entrepreneurship and startup advice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. She emphasized that these were initially seen as adventures, not career strategic moves, yet they provided valuable learning experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### Google Experience: Lessons in Scaling
While Google was a place of "top-notch" talent, Elizabeth's experience there (2007-2008) highlighted how *not* to grow a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. At 20,000 employees, Google's flat hierarchy led to "constant whiplash," with conflicting directives from executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. This environment was not conducive to her ability to thrive, teaching her the importance of recognizing where one can "win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

### LaunchBit: Navigating Startup Mistakes
After leaving Google in late 2008 amidst Sequoia's "Rest in Peace Good Times" memo about a looming capital drought, Elizabeth decided to start LaunchBit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. She admits to being naive and making many common [[lessons_from_experiencing_a_startup_failure | mistakes a new entrepreneur]] would make, especially due to the lack of readily available knowledge on how to build a business (pre-Lean Startup, pre-popular blogs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

Key mistakes and corresponding lessons:
*   **Not validating demand**: The first product built took months but nobody wanted it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.
*   **Setting company culture**: Initially, hiring was based purely on skill set rather than personality fit for the company's mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. At Hustle Fund, for example, kindness is a core value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This emphasizes the need to market to potential job candidates and attract many people who want to work at your company, not just one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.
*   **Lack of guidance**: She wished for more guidance on how to build a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

### When to Exit a Company
Deciding when to exit is a complex decision, not often predictable from the start of a venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. For LaunchBit, Elizabeth considered professional and personal factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
*   **Professional**: Recognizing that the ads business is prone to consolidation and that they might not "win" in the long term in that specific "game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>.
*   **Personal**: Feeling that the team's culture was "a little bit off" and personally becoming jaded by the ads world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

## Transition to Investing: Lessons from Accelerators
Elizabeth's transition to investing was gradual, starting by mentoring at 500 Startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. Running their accelerator program, she oversaw 200 investments, gaining "investing lessons on steroids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. She believes working at an accelerator is one of the best ways to learn how to invest because it provides:
*   **High Repetition**: Meeting a large volume of companies (the good, bad, and ugly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.
*   **Tight Feedback Loops**: Investing and then closely observing companies daily for months helps assess decision-making more effectively than traditional VC models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

## Founding Hustle Fund: A Differentiated Approach
Starting Hustle Fund in 2017 with Eric Bahn, they recognized a significant opportunity in the pre-seed space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>. In 2017, truly early-stage investors (pre-revenue, half-baked idea) were scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.

Their initial pitch to LPs (Limited Partners) was met with skepticism, as thousands of funds claim to be differentiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. They iterated their pitch 20 times to highlight what made them unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

Hustle Fund's differentiated model:
*   **Addressing the "Rich Uncle" Problem**: Investing in pre-seed where many founders lack friends and family capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.
*   **Small Initial Checks & Double Down**: Investing small checks (e.g., $25k) globally, working with founders, and then potentially doubling down at the seed stage (around 20% of the time) based on their operational performance and alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>. This model leverages observation of founders in action rather than just listening to their pitches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_rapid_growth_and_success_in_startups | Strategies for Rapid Growth and Success in Startups]]
### Thematic of "Speed of Execution"
The best founders exhibit "speed" â€“ a core reason for Hustle Fund's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. Given limited runway, more experiments or "shots on goal" increase the likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. Successful founders quickly de-risk ideas and move on if they don't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

Key components of speed of execution:
*   **Learning Ability**: CEOs must wear many hats. The quicker they learn new skills, the easier it is to run experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>. Charisma to attract a great team for weaknesses, even with limited funds, also helps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>.
*   **Prioritization**: Understanding the single most important thing to figure out in the next 2-4 weeks and letting everything else drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.
*   **Frugality**: Stretching runway and dollars further. Good founders are adept at convincing talent to work for equity or near-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>. This requires strong recruiting, hiring, and sales skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

> [!NOTE] CEO Skill Combination
> A successful CEO needs to be able to do all these things reasonably well: strategic thinking, quick thinking, and sales skills (to customers and team) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>.

## [[lessons_from_scaling_and_entrepreneurship | Scaling an Organization]] and Building a Brand
Hustle Fund, with around 30 people, manages a large portfolio by employing unique [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_execution_and_marketing | strategies for scaling]] and organization:
*   **Diverse Revenue Streams**: Beyond management fees from their three funds, they have other business lines that generate revenue, allowing them to afford more resources to help founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.
*   **Systems and Processes**: Implementing efficient systems and processes, some tech-based, to streamline operations. For example, running workshops for many founders simultaneously addresses common problems like pitch deck creation or customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>.

### Building a Strong Organizational Culture
Elizabeth dedicates significant time to operations and culture, lessons learned from her previous startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. They prioritize hiring based on cultural fit (e.g., valuing kindness) over just skill set, even if it means delaying hires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>. Effective recruitment means constantly marketing the company to potential candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>.

### Brand Building and Customer Acquisition for a Fund
Treating Hustle Fund like a startup, Elizabeth applies lessons from her previous venture on customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>. While not selling a product, they are selling Hustle Fund as a brand to attract founders for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>. This involves extensive experimentation with various channels (Clubhouse, TikTok, YouTube, Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. Twitter proved highly effective, with over half of applications coming from that channel, leading to a "brute forced" daily tweeting strategy based on data insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.

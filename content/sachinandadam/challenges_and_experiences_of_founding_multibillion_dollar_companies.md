Vu Tran, a doctor and co-founder of Goan, an edtech company that grew to a multi-billion dollar valuation, shares his insights on the journey of building a successful enterprise and the personal challenges involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## The Genesis of Goan

Vu Tran, alongside his three other [[challenges_and_experiences_of_cofounders | co-founders]] Andrew Barnes, Chris Agland, and Chris Hood, embarked on their entrepreneurial journey long before Goan became a [[building_a_billion_dollar_company | multi-billion dollar company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Their first business together started when Vu and Andrew were 17, and they spent more than half of Vu's life (18 years) building businesses together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. During their early days, they were "building crappy websites and going down the road and flogging them door to door" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

Instead of having a clear mission statement, their primary motivation was simply to "build something together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. This period, described as "wandering the desert trying to find something that would stick," spanned about 8 to 9 years before Goan's public success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

### The Importance of Co-Founders

Vu emphasizes that his "luck" in [[building_a_billion_dollar_company | building Goan]] was not in choosing the right vertical, but in meeting his [[challenges_and_experiences_of_cofounders | co-founders]] at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. He highlights the critical role of having a co-founding team that is:
*   **Honest and Trusting**: The ability to "duke it out with each other and still walk away being best friends" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. This allows for quick decision-making and open, sometimes harsh, criticism that is understood to come from a good place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.
*   **Complementary**: The Goan [[challenges_and_experiences_of_cofounders | co-founders]] had diverse academic and professional backgrounds, which allowed them to "cover that whole 360 degree sort of part of that pie when it comes to personalities capabilities and abilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.
    *   **Andrew Barnes**: An economist and Rhodes Scholar, whose pursuit of a scholarship led to Goan's London office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
    *   **Chris Agland**: A lawyer and former Australian Youth Ambassador to the United Nations, whose clerkship in South Africa influenced Goan's Johannesburg office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
    *   **Vu Tran**: A practicing General Practitioner (GP) who maintained his medical career throughout Goan's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

This diversity of personal aspirations, enabled by the flexible nature of their entrepreneurial venture, allowed each founder to pursue their individual paths while collectively growing the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

## Challenges of Scaling and Personal Fit

Goan grew into a significant entity, valued at $3.5 billion, with operations across 22 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. However, this growth brought new [[challenges_of_scaling_and_pivoting_startups | challenges of scaling]].

### Scar Tissue and Hard Lessons
Vu openly discusses the "plenty of scar tissue" accumulated from founding a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Early on, they even resorted to "collecting credit cards like there were Pok√©mon cards" to manage cash flow, especially given the nascent venture capital industry in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

He likens the entrepreneurial journey to Elon Musk's description of "chewing glass and staring into the abyss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> and Steve Jobs's "reality distortion field" which includes "blissful ignorance" about the difficulties ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Vu acknowledges that knowing how "freaking hard it would be," he might not have done it again, similar to Nvidia founder Jensen Huang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

### Personal Preference for Early Stage Building
Despite Goan's immense success, Vu discovered that his personal passion lay in the "early stage" of building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. He loves the ability to "build," "be small and nimble," and have a "direct impact" as a founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. He recognized he was "not made for the world where you know you've got an executive team and you've got different leaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This self-awareness, honed over years, drove his decision to transition.

### Stepping Back and Moving Forward
Stepping back from Goan was a gradual process that took at least two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Vu felt it was crucial to manage his exit responsibly, especially since "half the company answers into you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. He prioritized "succession look like and making sure that you know something that for me that we've built from scratch... it's really important to do it right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

His departure was driven by a "pull factor" towards a new venture, rather than a "push factor" away from Goan, which he deeply loves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. This pull is his desire to build from the ground up again, this time in the controversial defense sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

## Lessons on Resilience and Purpose

Vu's experiences have taught him the importance of resilience. He relates it to the idea that "suffering is actually part of it, it's part of that growth" and a way to "test it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>. He aims to use all his experiences, good and bad, to inform his next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

He emphasizes that success isn't just for "a 20-something year old white male who come out of University," but for "whoever's willing to take the punt and actually have a go building something they believe in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. His background as the son of Vietnamese refugees, exposed to entrepreneurial parents from a young age, shaped his "hustle and grind" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

Vu advises aspiring founders to focus on "how" to achieve their goals, rather than "can we" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. This problem-solving approach and deep belief in their mission are what enable founders to "find the time and make the time" for what's truly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

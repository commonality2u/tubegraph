Media plays a significant role in modern tech entrepreneurship, serving as a core business model, a distribution channel, and a way to foster deep connections with an audience. For founders Adam and Sain, their journey into [[building_a_tech_media_company | building a tech media company]] evolved from a personal podcast into a strategic venture.

## From Curiosity to Company: An Origin Story

Adam and Sain initially started a podcast out of boredom, using it as a vehicle for personal curiosity and discovery rather than a strategic business endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Their content naturally reflected their evolving interests, shifting from general topics to interviews with entrepreneurs and venture capitalists as they became more interested in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. This organic approach, driven by genuine curiosity rather than transactional intentions, laid the groundwork for their future company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:50:00">[23:50:00]</a>.

A major breakthrough for their podcast was securing an interview with Malcolm Turnbull, a former Prime Minister of Australia, which generated millions of views on TikTok and demonstrated the potential reach of their content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. This success, coupled with interviews with figures like Adam Ilgam (who later became an investor) from Giant Leap Fund, further solidified their focus on tech and [[the_role_of_media_in_venture_capital | venture capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

### The "Building Public" Approach

Adam and Sain adopted a "building public" approach for their company, Kindling, aiming to provide a raw, behind-the-scenes look at the highs and lows of [[building_a_successful_tech_startup | building a successful tech startup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. They plan to share details on fundraising, weekly operations, challenges, and personal impacts on their friendship and daily lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. This transparency serves as both a journal for themselves and a valuable resource for others interested in [[founder_experiences_and_strategies_in_tech_startups | founder experiences and strategies in tech startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Media as a Core Business Strategy

The founders recognized that their podcast wasn't just a side project, but could be integrated as a significant component of their new venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Their vision evolved from simply doing a podcast full-time to building a large-scale [[building_a_tech_media_company | tech media company]] for the Asia Pacific region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, aiming to impact millions of people and potentially achieve a valuation of over $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

The core strategy revolves around two main parts:
1.  **Building APAC's Tech Media Company**: This involves creating and partnering on podcasts, newsletters, and other content formats across various platforms within the tech media space, initially focusing on APAC and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>. They aim to tell stories that inspire and educate people about technology and entrepreneurs in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>.
2.  **Leveraging Media for Data and Insights**: Recognizing that media generates not just eyeballs but also information, data, and insights, the company plans to use this intelligence to build other ventures, such as in the EdTech space or customer intelligence platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>.

### Distribution-First Approach

Inspired by models like Logan Paul's Prime and Mr. Beast's chocolate brand, Kindling operates on a "distribution-first" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>. This approach prioritizes building an audience and distribution channels through media, which can then serve as a foundation for other products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:11:00">[31:11:00]</a>. This contrasts with traditional startups that might focus solely on [[product_development_and_innovation_in_tech_startups | product development and innovation in tech startups]] before considering distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:15:00">[31:15:00]</a>.

[!NOTE] **The Significance of Media and Distribution**:
> "I met so many founders with brilliant product... but they just hadn't figured out their distribution strategy, they hadn't figured out their go to market and so we're almost building a company which you know will get to cash flow positive in its own right but it will be distribution first from all these different media channels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:15:00">[31:15:00]</a>

### The Creator Economy and Parasocial Relationships

A key belief underpinning Kindling's strategy is the growing significance of parasocial relationships between creators and their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:33:00">[31:33:00]</a>. As traditional media wanes, individuals are forming deeper connections with independent creators, leading to increased influence and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:40:00">[31:40:00]</a>. The proliferation of AI tools also makes software development easier, shifting the competitive advantage towards distribution and these personal connections forged through media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:22:00">[32:22:00]</a>.

The founders draw inspiration from companies like Colossus and Turpentine, which are also exploring similar media-plus-data models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>. This validation from successful entrepreneurs like Eric Turpenberg (founder of On Deck and early employee at Product Hunt) reinforces their belief that they are "on to something special" in the current age of media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:31:00">[33:31:00]</a>.

## Overcoming Mindset Limitations

Initially, the founders' thinking about [[building_a_tech_media_company | building a tech media company]] was constrained by a "venture mindset" that emphasized building billion-dollar Enterprise SaaS companies to generate large fund returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>. However, a moment of clarity led to the realization that they didn't have to adhere to this narrow definition of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>. They decided to focus on creating value for millions of people and then monetizing through various business models, embracing the idea that a company can be "very, very serious" without being a traditional SaaS giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This shift in perspective was crucial for giving themselves permission to "think big" and pursue a venture that felt deeply aligned with their passions and ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.

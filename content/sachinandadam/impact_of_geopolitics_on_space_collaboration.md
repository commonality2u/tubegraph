The current era has seen a significant shift in space, moving away from a deeply collaborative environment towards one increasingly shaped by terrestrial geopolitical dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This transformation is evident in the actions of countries' commercial sectors, national policy settings, and both government and private investment in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

## Historical Context

Historically, space was a realm of profound collaboration, exemplified by projects like the International Space Station (ISS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. The ISS brought together former adversaries, such as the US and Russia, along with many other nations, to contribute to a joint project that benefited humankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

## The New Space Race

This cooperative ideal is now being displaced by the same dynamics of competition and the desire for dominance observed on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. The [[the_new_space_race_and_global_satellite_boom | new space race]] involves the US government, adversaries of the West, and private entities like Elon Musk, alongside a dramatic boom in the number of satellites in orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This race also includes countries spying on each other in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

The rise of new powers, shifting power dynamics, and the emergence of different relationships and blocs globally are reflected directly in space activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

## Implications for Transparency and Stability

The sheer volume of satellites being launched creates problems beyond debris and maintenance, including governments attempting to spy on each other in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. The lack of transparency in space is sometimes exploited by malicious actors to create fear and conflict on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.

### Role of Heo Space

Heo Space, an Australian startup, plays a critical [[role_of_startups_in_space_surveillance_and_satellite_monitoring | role]] in helping Western allies in this competitive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. They develop cameras and sensors for satellites, which assist governments and companies in monitoring activities in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Heo's mission is to make space transparent, aiming to image anything in the solar system on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. This transparency is vital for understanding if a satellite is not working as intended, and how to address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.

## Regulatory Landscape

The sensitive nature of the space industry and its close ties to government contracts mean that regulatory changes can significantly impact companies within the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. For instance, US monopoly laws previously prevented US companies from entering the market that Heo operated in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>. Heo's activities in Australia actually triggered a change in this US law approximately 18 months ago, allowing other companies to enter the space imaging market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>. This "first mover" advantage significantly benefited Heo, as competitors are only now beginning to release similar products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>.

This change also presents an opportunity for Heo to partner with US companies that were previously prohibited from engaging in non-Earth imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>. By renting time on other satellites and monetizing their downtime, Heo can onboard sensors from the US that were previously inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>.

The future of space is envisioned as becoming a more transparent place within the next five years, with companies like Heo playing a crucial role in that development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>.

The CEO of Lorikeet has had a "storied career" as an [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_australian_tech_ecosystem | Australian operator]], building one of Australia's fastest-growing companies [01:00:00]. Their career path, marked by deliberate choices and a relentless pursuit of impact, offers a unique perspective on career growth, company building, and the evolving tech landscape.

## A Philosophy of Purposeful Career Moves

The CEO's career moves have been driven by a deep self-assessment of their exceptional abilities [02:20:20]. At Bridgewater, despite being in the top 20% of their cohort with potential to lead the currency team, they realized they would never be the CIO [02:38:00]. This prompted a significant pay cut to seek an area where they could be "better than top 20%" [02:55:00].

Similarly, at Stripe, they were given significant responsibility, eventually reporting to the CTO and managing complex product infrastructure and a planned IPO [03:11:00]. However, they found themselves jealous of Product Managers talking to users and decided to leave for a smaller company to own product and ship things faster [03:35:00]. This reflects a continuous drive to find roles where they could learn quickly and be in the "driver's seat" [03:57:00].

### The Path to Founding

For a long time, becoming a founder wasn't a viable option due to financial constraints, only becoming possible after a secondary offering at Stripe provided a cushion [04:36:00]. The CEO initially believed they needed an absolutely compelling idea to work on [04:52:00]. However, a friend, Dylan from Quillar, advised that "that's enough" to just get started, learning along the way [05:07:00]. This shifted mindset was crucial for their entrepreneurial leap [05:12:00].

## Accelerated Growth and "Permissionless" Work

The CEO's rapid ascent at companies like Bridgewater and Stripe was fueled by an "impatient" approach, characterized by "just doing things" without waiting for permission [05:48:00].

### Examples from Stripe
*   **Global Expansion**: Invited themselves to a weekly meeting on global expansion. After hearing a recurring problem about a specific feature needed in Brazil, they offered to do the legwork and find a solution, leading to the feature being built and shipped [06:04:00].
*   **Product Management Transition**: While working on the BizOps team, they would spend weekends integrating other teams' APIs and writing "friction logs" (detailed analyses of user pain points). Sharing these "permissionlessly" with product teams led to an offer to become a Product Manager [06:37:00].

This approach highlights a core belief that "you're allowed... to just do stuff" [07:31:00].

## The Roots of Ambition

The CEO's ambition and "impatience" to do more stem from early life experiences [07:39:00]. Extensive participation in debating during university and high school provided an "early benchmark of what it feels like to be good at something" [08:15:00]. This experience taught them that while effort is required, true leverage comes from applying work to areas where one naturally excels, allowing for the accomplishment of difficult tasks with less effort than others [08:26:00]. This contrasts with areas they are not naturally good at, such as sport, providing a clear understanding of average versus exceptional performance [08:38:00].

## Lorikeet's Culture and Operating Principles

Having worked at companies with distinct cultures like Stripe and Bridgewater, the CEO emphasizes the importance of explicit "rules of the road" for how a company operates [10:10:00]. They contrasted this with an internship at BuzzFeed, where a lack of clear principles led to inconsistent and potentially detrimental behavior from executives [10:18:00].

At Lorikeet, one of the first actions when the team reached five or six people was to define their operating principles [11:04:00]. This list is intentionally short, focusing on aspects where Lorikeet aims to be "fairly distinctive to the norm" [11:11:00]. These principles provide a high-leverage framework for decision-making [11:22:00].

### Key Principles and Their Reinforcement
*   **The Front Page Test (Stripe's influence)**: "If what you're about to do or say was printed in the Wall Street Journal, how would you feel about it?" [11:28:00]. This serves as a quick shorthand to evaluate decisions and behaviors [11:36:00].
*   **Continuous Reinforcement**: Operating principles must be constantly discussed, written into performance reviews, and acknowledged as aspirational versus empirically true to maintain integrity [12:04:00].

## Lorikeet's AI Thesis and Product Differentiation

The CEO founded Lorikeet on the thesis that compute costs for AI would decrease over time [13:02:00]. The recent drop in inference costs, exemplified by DeepSeek, aligns with this [13:08:00]. This trend is beneficial for Lorikeet, allowing them to focus on building a high-quality product, as cost optimization becomes more impactful at scale [13:40:00].

Lorikeet's approach to AI agents, particularly in customer support, is distinct from many competitors [14:40:00]. While many entered the market by commercializing "retrieval augmented generation" (RAG) for FAQs, Lorikeet's co-founder, Jamie, had a deeper background in LLM research [15:05:00].

### Differentiating Approach
*   **Beyond FAQs**: Lorikeet observed that customer support teams in complex, regulated businesses spend less time summarizing FAQs and more time executing "complex standard operating procedures" involving data retrieval, judgment, and coordination [15:50:00].
*   **Two-Tiered Product**: Lorikeet offers low-config, low-precision coverage with RAG, but layers on an "agentic framework" for executing complex, multi-step processes with high accuracy across arbitrary process depths [16:19:00]. This is unique in the market, allowing them to handle cases where even minor errors would be catastrophic [21:00:00].
*   **Configurability, Not Customization**: Unlike Palantir's model of extensive custom code for each instance, Lorikeet aims for a "self-servable product" with "a ton of knobs and dials" [17:41:00]. This allows businesses to configure the desired level of precision and effort based on their specific needs, from basic summaries to critical, "dialed-in" responses for emergencies [21:29:00].

## Winning in the AI Agent Space: Australian vs. Global Context

The CEO believes that winning in the AI agent space, especially as an [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_australian_tech_ecosystem | Australian company]], hinges on "solving the right problem and solving it in an effective way" combined with strong execution [19:05:00]. They contend that large sums of money don't automatically translate into good software, creating an opportunity for startups [19:24:00].

Lorikeet's differentiation lies in its "founding myth": chasing the hardest problem (complex support tickets) from the start and independently devising technology solutions, rather than commercializing existing technology [20:04:00].

### Challenges to Winning
*   **Go-to-Market**: The primary risk for Lorikeet is not getting into a "vendor consideration process" where their product can be directly compared against competitors through proofs of concept or pilots [42:15:00]. In such head-to-head tests, Lorikeet's solutions consistently perform well [42:21:00]. However, external factors like investor influence can derail deals before product performance is even assessed [42:50:00].
*   **Marketing**: The CEO identifies marketing as a personal weakness, with their natural inclination being towards product development [27:31:00]. Lorikeet cannot win by outspending competitors on sales or paid marketing [46:03:00]. Instead, they must rely on "cheeky and interesting" approaches and "permissionless" content that generates "free viral distribution" and intent signals [46:17:00]. They advocate for insightful content that directly addresses the problems of their target audience (e.g., customer support leaders), rather than generic startup advice [48:38:00].

## The Future of Careers with AI Agents

The CEO believes AI's impact on careers will primarily be on the *content* of jobs rather than their *existence* [24:35:00]. For instance, a paralegal's job will still exist, but tedious tasks like pagination will be automated, leading to more interesting and leveraged work, such as scoring AI outputs or curating knowledge [24:53:00].

In customer support, AI agents will integrate support functions more closely with product development [25:51:00]. Customer support is seen as an "unhandled exception" of product experience, and as AI makes solving these exceptions scalable and cheap, product teams will directly manage AI systems for user needs [26:01:00]. This means understanding users and edge cases will become even more crucial, and product building will encompass training and deploying AI agents [27:05:00].

## Intentional Team Building in Australia

The CEO's core belief about team building is that "solving high hard problems together and winning" are the fundamental drivers of strong teams and high morale [31:19:00]. They are skeptical of activities specifically targeted at morale, viewing them as secondary to the thrill of shipping good products and receiving positive feedback [31:50:00].

### Hiring Philosophy
*   **Arbitrage the Talent Market**: Unlike well-resourced companies like Stripe that can attract top talent effortlessly, most companies must have a "thesis behind Arbitrage in the talent Market" to attract better talent than they might otherwise deserve [33:00:00].
*   **Targeting Specific Qualities**: For early engineers at Lorikeet, the thesis focused on "high degree of comfort with ambiguity and a strong desire to be close to users" [33:40:00]. This allowed them to hire impactful individuals who might be screened out by conventional processes [33:51:00]. They also actively seek "pretty technical Talent out there who can't or don't want to be software Engineers," like "forward deployed engineers," finding them highly impactful [34:10:00].
*   **Filtering for Fit**: They explicitly filter out candidates whose passions don't align with the company's work (e.g., compiler research not applicable to Lorikeet) [34:31:00].

### In-Office Work
Lorikeet generally prefers in-office work by default, especially for core R&D and high-bandwidth conversations, allowing for higher flexibility on exceptions [35:35:00]. While acknowledging its context-dependence, they believe it's valuable for making high-volume, high-bandwidth decisions and enabling the hiring of a range of experience levels, including junior team members [35:24:00]. Remote-only models, in their view, often limit hiring to very senior people [36:09:00].

### [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_australian_tech_ecosystem | Australian Tech Ecosystem]] Observations
The CEO observes a difference in focus within the [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_australian_tech_ecosystem | Australian startup]] talent market compared to Silicon Valley [37:00:00]. In San Francisco, job seekers are often obsessed with whether a company "is going to win," asking about burn rate, customer retention, and interviewing customers [37:19:00]. Ancillary benefits like dog-friendly offices or bar fridges are secondary [37:50:00].

A significant difference is the prevalence of people in SF "taking steps down in title, compensation, scope, job function to get into the companies they want" [38:01:00]. The CEO himself took a step down to join Watershed [38:36:00]. This is "so little of" in Australia, where people are often reluctant to be "on the tools" if they are perceived as "too senior" [38:50:00].

This disparity, they theorize, stems from an insufficient internalization of the impact of joining a strong company on career capital and finances in the [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_australian_tech_ecosystem | Australian ecosystem]] [39:31:00]. Historically, some large [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_australian_tech_ecosystem | Australian tech]] wins did not distribute enough equity to employees, leading to a "doom loop" where candidates undervalue equity, and companies therefore don't offer much [40:41:00]. This leads to "value-destructive" self-preservation activities, like taking "Chief of Staff" roles that may offer less practical experience than a support rep role, simply for title or pay, because the equity is assumed "worthless" [40:11:00]. The CEO hopes upcoming events like the Canva IPO might shift this dynamic [41:06:00].

Despite these observations, the CEO remains bullish on building a massive business from Australia, stating that the local talent and population constraints are "so far away" from being an impediment for Lorikeet's growth trajectory [44:48:00]. Failure, if it comes, would more likely be due to poor marketing or squandering their product lead, not their Australian base [45:34:00].

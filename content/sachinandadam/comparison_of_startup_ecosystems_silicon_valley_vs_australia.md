Moses Low, a fintech entrepreneur who grew up in Australia before moving to the United States, provides insights into the [[Comparing the startup ecosystems and cultural differences between Australia and the USA | differences between the Australian and Silicon Valley startup ecosystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. His company, Zendit, was the first Indonesian business to go through Y Combinator, a prestigious startup accelerator based in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Why Silicon Valley? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>

Moses Low, despite starting his career in Australia as a management consultant at BCG after graduating from UNSW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, felt the need to go to Silicon Valley to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. He believed Australia didn't offer "great places to do startups" at the time, and that the Valley was where "big ideas are done" and "big money is raised" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Australia was perceived as "too small a place" with cultural aspects that made starting businesses difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

He noted that Silicon Valley's strength lies in its network effect, stemming from having "the most capital in the world" and some of the "highest talent" globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. This creates a "critical mass of ideas flowing all the time with the talent to make it happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.

Furthermore, access to experienced mentors who have built billion-dollar companies, such as Justin Kan (Twitch) and Jeff Ralston (Yahoo Mail), provides a "very different quality of advice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Moses recounts how Y Combinator, a leading accelerator, attracts top investors and startups, creating a powerful network effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.

## Cultural Contrasts and Paradigm Shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>

A significant [[Differences in global startup cultures particularly between Australia and Silicon Valley | cultural difference]] highlighted by Moses Low is the mindset towards ambition and scale. He shared an anecdote about a Silicon Valley VC, Rob Chandra (a five-time Forbes Midas List honoree), who told him not to discuss ideas unless they were "worth a billion dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. This interaction marked a "paradigm shift" for Moses, as no one had ever expected him to come up with such large-scale ideas before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. This kind of belief and expectation is a defining characteristic of Silicon Valley's culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

In contrast, Australia often struggles with a "tall poppy syndrome," where high achievers may be cut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. This can create an environment where individuals are not expected to pursue "billionaire ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>.

## Australian Entrepreneurial Strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>

Despite the perceived challenges, Moses Low emphasizes that Australians possess unique attributes that make them good entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>:

*   **Ingenuity from "Laziness"**: Australians are "known for being lazy," which Moses suggests makes them good entrepreneurs because "we don't like to build things that take time and we don't like to have to do things we don't have to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. This drives them to "do more with less," which is fundamental to software-as-a-service (SaaS) and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>. He cites the Gallipoli retreat's automatic firing gun invention as an example of Australian ingenuity born from a desire to avoid unnecessary work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
*   **Humility and Self-Awareness**: Australians are "not kind of big sticks up ourselves" and are less worried about external perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. This allows them to be honest about their failures and product shortcomings, fostering humility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. Moses believes this self-awareness helps avoid pitfalls like believing one's own "BS," leading to more customer-centric and grounded startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.

## The Evolving Australian Ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>

While Moses Low acknowledges that the Australian startup ecosystem has grown, with prominent VCs like Blackbird and AirTree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>, he still recommends that an ambitious young person in their early 20s move to Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. He attributes this preference to the Valley's established network effect of capital and talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. However, he notes that many startup lessons are now open-sourced through initiatives like Y Combinator's Startup School on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

## Investing in Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>

Moses Low chose to return to Southeast Asia because it offers "the fastest growing markets on earth" where few competitors are from the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. His company, Zendit, provides digital payments infrastructure in Southeast Asia, akin to Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

He identifies key trends enabling his business's success in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>:
*   **Demographics**: Indonesia is the fourth-largest country on Earth, with an average age under 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.
*   **Mobile Penetration**: Mobile phone penetration exceeds 100%, and smartphone penetration is around 80% and growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. People moved directly to mobile, skipping laptops/desktops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Digital Adoption**: Southeast Asian cities are highly social, with high usage of platforms like Twitter and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure Gap**: Despite high digital adoption, infrastructure is "extremely poor," creating significant opportunities for businesses like Zendit that build essential digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

In 2015, payments in Indonesia were challenging; there was no single API for accepting payments, and no APIs at all for sending money at scale, leading Zendit to build their own infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>. Moses believes infrastructure plays are crucial because they help the region build things it has never seen and benefit from the macro trends towards digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

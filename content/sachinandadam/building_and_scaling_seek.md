Paul Bassat is recognized as a key figure in the startup and venture capital industry, notably for co-founding Seek, one of Australia's earliest and most successful internet businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Seek has grown into an eight billion dollar company that went on to IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. As of the time of the discussion, Seek was approaching its 25th anniversary, continuing to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

## Founding and Early Days

Paul Bassat, along with his brother Andrew and Matt Rockman, started Seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The business officially went live on March 16, 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. Initially, the first month's revenue was only $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>.

### The Cold Start Problem
A significant challenge in the early days was the "cold start problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This refers to marketplace businesses needing critical mass on both the supply and demand sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. For Seek, this meant starting with no job seekers looking for jobs and no job ads for job seekers to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Historically, people found jobs through newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges

### Strategy for Attracting Volume
The founders knew that employment advertising, like real estate and automotive classifieds, would transition from print to online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Their strategy involved:
*   **Pricing as a Lever**: They used price aggressively to attract job ads, not letting anything impede ads from going online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Supplementary Medium**: Seek positioned itself initially as a supplementary medium to newspaper advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. They didn't tell clients to stop advertising in newspapers because that would cause an immediate loss of candidates for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Over time, as Seek grew, clients naturally transitioned away from print <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
*   **Manual Effort**: The first major advertiser, a recruitment firm named Chandler Macleod, faxed 300 ads, which the Seek team manually typed out over a weekend to launch the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

### Market Perception
During the dot-com boom, the internet's potential for employment advertising felt "incredibly obvious" to the Seek founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. However, many others, including competitors, were skeptical, with one newspaper publisher famously stating, "you can't read the internet on the toilet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. This "cognitive dissonance" from competitors ultimately benefited Seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

## Growth and Valuation Milestones

Seek's growth trajectory showcased the volatility and eventual recognition of value in the market:
*   **2000**: Two and a half years into its journey, Seek raised money at a $100 million valuation, just before the dot-com crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.
*   **2003**: Two and a half years later, in 2003, they raised money at the *same* $100 million valuation, suggesting the market perceived zero value creation during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.
*   **2005**: Two years later, in 2005, Seek IPO'd with a $700 million valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.
*   **~2007**: A couple of years after IPO, Seek was worth about $3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.

Despite market fluctuations, the period between 2000 and 2003 was seen as the "single most important value creation period" for Seek, as it laid the foundations for its future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.

## Lessons from the Seek Journey

Paul Bassat draws several [[lessons_from_scaling_and_entrepreneurship | lessons from his experience building Seek]]:
*   **Don't Fear Downturns**: If a company is well-capitalized and has a strong business model, a downturn, while tough, can lead to a more enduring and durable business on the other side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.
*   **Growth is Key, but Sustainable**: For a young startup, the only way to become a great business is to grow revenue; one "cannot shrink your way to greatness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>. However, this growth must be sustainable, with unit economics that make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>. The market previously rewarded "growth at any cost," but this is unsustainable if customer acquisition costs exceed customer value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.
*   **Compounding Growth**: Companies like Atlassian, which grew steadily for over two decades without relying on venture capital initially, demonstrate the power of compounding growth over a long period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

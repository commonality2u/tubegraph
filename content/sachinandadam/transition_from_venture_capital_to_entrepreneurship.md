Jesse Woo, a prominent venture capitalist in the Australian ecosystem, has transitioned from her role as a partner at AfterWork Ventures to become the founder and managing director of Oncore, a strategic communications agency [00:00:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. AfterWork Ventures is a $2 million community-powered [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | VC fund]] that invests in pre-seed and Seed stage startups [00:00:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This career shift reflects a deeper personal evolution for Woo, moving towards a more creative and integrated professional life [00:01:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, [00:08:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## Personal Evolution and Driving Motivations

Woo noted significant internal changes since March 2023, attributing much of her accelerated personal development to coaching [00:02:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Working with her coach, Zan, based in San Francisco, provided clarity on her identity and values, helping her become a more integrated person [00:02:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, [00:02:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This process involved understanding and productively incorporating parts of herself that were previously perceived as "rabid," "ambitious," and "hungry," driven by conventional success and external validation [00:03:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, [00:04:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, [00:05:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

A powerful visualization exercise revealed her desired future life: one full of joy, abundance, creativity, and ease [00:05:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, [00:06:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This vision contrasted with a traditional corporate environment, emphasizing an uplifting, warm office where she could address creative problems [00:07:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, [00:07:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The shift from a Management Consultant to an investor and now to a more creative entrepreneurial role aligns with these intrinsic drivers [00:09:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Founding a Business: Challenges and Advantages

### Mental Toughness and Resilience
Woo emphasizes that being a founder is inherently tough, requiring significant mental toughness [00:09:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. She noted that while investors test a founder's intellectual and commercial acumen, the day-to-day reality involves feeling overwhelmed by setbacks [00:09:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, [00:10:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The ability to put things into perspective, get good rest, and relentlessly pursue goals is crucial [00:10:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Having a co-founder can provide essential support, making the solo founder journey particularly challenging [00:10:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, [00:10:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

Founders often face emotional pain and fatigue from rejections and setbacks, which investors may not fully grasp [00:11:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, [00:11:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The journey demands grit and resilience more than just intellectual horsepower [00:11:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, [00:11:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Developing stoicism and pattern recognition about impermanence helps in navigating continuous challenges [00:14:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, [00:15:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, [00:16:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, [00:16:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

### Benefits of a VC Background
Woo advocates for young [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | VC professionals]] to transition to founding roles [00:12:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, [00:12:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. A background in [[Navigating venture capital and startup ecosystems | venture capital]] offers significant advantages:
*   **Network**: Providing early access to valuable connections for sales and other needs [00:12:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, [00:12:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Pattern Recognition**: Gaining insights into common startup problems by observing hundreds of founders [00:12:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, [00:12:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Sales Skills**: Developing sales abilities useful for enterprise sales [00:13:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, [00:13:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

She views founding as a "boot camp for mental toughness," leading to personal growth regardless of success or failure [00:13:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, [00:13:25](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>, [00:13:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Business Model: Beyond Venture Scale
Woo challenges the false dichotomy between "venture scale" and "lifestyle" businesses [00:42:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>. She suggests that a "lifestyle business" can still be highly ambitious, aiming for a huge team and significant impact, while generating profit without external investors [00:42:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>, [00:43:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>, [00:43:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>. Professional services businesses, like Oncore, can start with minimal upfront capital and position themselves as investments rather than costs, especially if they drive top-line revenue [00:44:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>, [00:44:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>, [00:44:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

## Oncore's Ambition and Principles

Woo envisions Oncore as a "Launchpad for really epic careers," empowering early-career professionals to become leaders [00:45:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>, [00:45:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>, [00:46:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. The work involves spotting emerging trends and leveraging them for clients [00:46:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>, [00:47:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, [00:47:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>. She plans to use AI tools to enhance trend identification and newsjacking, crawling publications and social media to spot keywords and cultural shifts [00:50:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>, [00:50:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>, [00:50:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

Oncore's core principles are:
1.  **Make the Right People Famous**: Intentionally choosing clients who align with principles of integrity and fair practices, refusing to work with those who are unscrupulous or abusive [01:10:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>, [01:10:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>, [01:11:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:06">[01:11:06]</a>, [01:11:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.
2.  **Always Tell the Truth**: Rejecting the traditional PR role of obfuscating or hiding the truth, instead aiming for transparency and leveraging honesty to strengthen brand reputation [01:11:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>, [01:11:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>, [01:12:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>, [01:13:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.

This approach acknowledges that while the truth may be challenging, it is increasingly difficult to hide in a world with citizen journalism and widespread social media [01:12:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:19">[01:12:19]</a>, [01:12:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>. Engaging with discourse and "clapping back" strategically can be a powerful way to command the narrative, rather than simply declining to comment [01:08:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>, [01:08:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>, [01:09:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

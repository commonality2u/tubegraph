Jack Zhang is the founder and CEO of Airwallex, a technology company that aims to revolutionize global business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. His approach to building a company is characterized by intense dedication and a deep-seated mission to empower entrepreneurs worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Early Life and the Genesis of Intensity

Zhang's [[founders_motivations_and_personal_histories | journey and mindset]] are rooted in his early life experiences. He moved to Australia at the age of 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Initially, he was academically strong and "quite famous" in his school, but upon arriving in Australia, he became "no one" due to his poor English, which made him feel socially unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. This struggle instilled in him a profound sense of resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

During his university years, Zhang faced significant financial difficulties, which put immense pressure on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. He worked up to 16 hours a day for extended periods, sacrificing his social life to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. He recounts a memorable first date where he could only afford an $8.50 Chinese restaurant meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>, and at one point, he couldn't even afford a $2.50 chocolate waffle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. These experiences fueled his desire to be successful while he had the ability to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

While acknowledging that such intense challenges built his character and resilience, Zhang stated he would not wish the same experiences on his own children, preferring them to have "some level of challenge" but not to that extreme degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:10]</a>.

## The Mission of Airwallex

Airwallex, valued at $8 billion, is considered one of Australia's great tech startup stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Zhang's drive for the company is not solely about achieving a trillion-dollar valuation; he no longer thinks about that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>. Instead, his primary motivation stems from the mission of "empowering entrepreneurs globally" to operate anywhere, anytime, by becoming a crucial economic infrastructure that helps them grow beyond borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.

He feels a "responsibility" to build this critical infrastructure for global entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. This involves tackling the complexities of the financial industry, including challenging regulatory environments, technological hurdles, data solvency, and risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. Airwallex aims to make life easier for entrepreneurs by alleviating the difficulties Zhang himself faced dealing with large institutions and cross-border operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. The ultimate success of Airwallex, for Zhang, is intertwined with the success of the millions of entrepreneurs it serves globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>.

A poignant example of this impact is when a man in Japan approached him, praising Airwallex for changing his life by simplifying global operations, eliminating hidden fees, and automating accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. This kind of feedback inspires Zhang to do more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>.

His commitment to this mission is so strong that when Stripe attempted to acquire Airwallex, Zhang refused, fearing he would "lose the control of our mission" and "the sense of purpose of existing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>.

## Leadership Style and Company Culture

Jack Zhang is described as a man of "intensity and insatiable ambition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. His friends describe him as "someone like on the mission" with clear goals and a willingness to work hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:53]</a>. While some might perceive him as serious or scary, he emphasizes building enduring relationships based on trust, showing a high degree of tolerance in fostering long-term connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

A core aspect of Airwallex's culture is being "okay with making mistakes, learning from the mistakes, getting better" and being "okay with taking risks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:36:00">[39:36:00]</a>. However, Zhang differentiates between mistakes made due to caring and effort versus those from carelessness or lack of curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:17:00">[40:17:00]</a>. He believes that if someone consistently makes mistakes due to carelessness or lack of curiosity, they should be fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:34:00">[40:34:00]</a>. Conversely, intelligent individuals who try hard and make mistakes should be encouraged to try again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:37:00">[40:37:00]</a>.

To foster a high-performance culture, Airwallex focuses on recruiting individuals who share the company's mission and values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:33:00">[30:33:00]</a>. They constantly raise the bar for recruitment, believing there are always enough ambitious people who want to work hard for a meaningful mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:55:00">[31:55:00]</a>. For new founders, Zhang advises prioritizing personality, raw intelligence, and general curiosity in candidates, as these traits are foundational for problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>. He admits that Airwallex learned how to recruit effectively relatively late in their [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_mindset | journey]], around 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:21:00">[33:21:00]</a>.

His own exceptional work ethic, often working 100-hour weeks, stems from doing something he is "passionate about and interested about," which makes it not "feel like work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:11:00">[38:11:00]</a>. He finds watching Netflix "less interesting than watching my commercial Dash interested the problem in that space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36:00">[38:36:00]</a>. This dedication comes with sacrifices, such as neglecting personal health and spending less time with family, which he does not necessarily recommend to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:05:00">[39:05:00]</a>.

## Views on the Ecosystem and Regulation

Zhang views the fintech industry as particularly challenging due to complicated regulatory environments and traditional banking systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. He expresses skepticism about Web3's ability to solve real-world payment problems, noting that existing systems can already offer free and instant payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>. While recognizing potential use cases for cryptocurrency in countries with volatile currencies, he believes the core ideology of digital currency conflicts with central banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>.

Regarding regulatory frameworks, he advocates for communication with regulators about industry issues and believes some are more open to change than others, though regulatory shifts are slow, taking years rather than weeks or months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:15:00">[26:15:00]</a>. He points out specific issues in Australia, like the high hurdles for payment facility licenses and capital requirements that favor traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>. He also champions FX transparency, pushing for mandatory disclosure of FX spreads by banks, which currently do not have to disclose them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>.

Comparing Australia's startup ecosystem to other regions, Zhang notes Melbourne's relative weakness compared to Sydney, which benefits from more successful tech companies and a stronger ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:31:00">[33:31:00]</a>. He observes that Australia's social welfare system, while beneficial for quality of life, may make it "harder to build grit" because individuals don't face the same pressures as in countries like the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:52:00">[45:52:00]</a>. He believes governments should play a more significant role through incentives, citing examples like Singapore and China, to foster long-term technological advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:15:00">[44:15:00]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Entrepreneurs

When asked for his most important [[advice_on_entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | advice for Founders]] fundraising, Zhang simply states "passion and honesty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:26:00">[49:26:00]</a>. He respects founders like Elon Musk for fundamentally changing industries and OpenAI for its potential to alter humanity's future trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:31:00">[49:31:00]</a>.

His ultimate message to a 25-year-old building a company is to "figure out if this is your true passion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:51:00">[51:51:00]</a>. He believes that passion is the only way to achieve large-scale success, as it prevents one from feeling tired or struggling, turning every challenge into an "interesting opportunity to solve a problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:04:00">[52:04:00]</a>. This reflects his own [[motivation_and_background_of_successful_entrepreneurs | personal experiences and goals in entrepreneurship]], where his dedication blurs the line between work and personal interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:11:00">[38:11:00]</a>.

The technology landscape is continually evolving, with significant trends observed in subscription services and the [[the_future_of_work_and_remote_working | gig economy]]. Tim Fung, founder of AirTasker, offers insights into these shifts, particularly within the context of Australia's startup ecosystem.

## Technology Trends

### Subscription Services and Consolidation
There has been a proliferation of subscription services (SaaS companies) that cater to almost every segment of a supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[30:43]</a>. While this offers specialized tools, it can lead to user inconvenience due to numerous registrations, logins, and integration challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[31:09]</a>.

It is anticipated that this area will undergo significant consolidation. Large technology companies like Google and Microsoft are likely to absorb many of these smaller players, leveraging their existing integrated ecosystems to offer comprehensive solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[31:19]</a>. For example, AirTasker primarily uses Google Hangouts over Zoom because of the convenience of integration with other Google services like Docs, Sheets, and Gmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[31:47]</a>. This highlights a broader trend in [[future_trends_in_the_technology_and_telecommunications_industry | technology and telecommunications]].

### Peer-to-Peer and the Sharing Economy
The internet's most impactful application lies in facilitating peer-to-peer exchanges, which enable a more efficient allocation and utilization of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[32:39]</a>. While the "sharing economy" concept initially garnered significant attention, it is seen as a fundamental, valuable creation that leverages the internet's network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[32:50]</a>. Examples include platforms like Airbnb, Etsy, and AirTasker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[32:27]</a>.

## The Gig Economy

The term "gig economy" is often considered misleading due to its broad nature, much like categorizing all "permanent full-time jobs" together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[35:39]</a>. There are significant nuances within the gig economy, with some platforms commoditizing work and driving down labor costs, while others empower individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[36:23]</a>.

### Distinctions within the Gig Economy
A key distinction lies in how the scope of work and pricing are determined:
*   **Platform-defined:** In some models (e.g., certain ride-sharing or delivery services), the platform defines the price and type of work, which can incentivize driving down labor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[36:37]</a>.
*   **Community-defined (e.g., AirTasker):** Platforms like AirTasker allow the community—either the customer or the "tasker" (service provider)—to define the scope of work and the associated price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[36:44]</a>. This model aims to create flexibility and allow individuals to monetize their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[37:53]</a>. For instance, a top tasker on AirTasker earned $297,000 in a year through high-value jobs like painting and moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[37:21]</a>. In this model, there is often an upward pressure on pricing, with taskers able to charge a premium due to their profile and reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[40:17]</a>.

### Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic had a two-directional impact on AirTasker. While stage three and four restrictions initially caused a downturn due to people being unable to leave their homes for work, it also accelerated the platform's bounce back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[33:21]</a>. AirTasker experienced faster growth in 2020 (during the pandemic) compared to 2018 and 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[33:47]</a>.

This resilience stems from AirTasker's "infinitely horizontal" marketplace model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[34:00]</a>. Unlike "verticalized" marketplaces (e.g., Uber, which focuses solely on driving), AirTasker's user-generated content model allows demand to seamlessly shift across different types of tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[34:21]</a>. For example, when cleaning tasks dropped by 50% during lockdowns, demand for bicycle repairs, fitness trainers, and "set up my home office" tasks significantly increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[34:56]</a>. This adaptability highlights how certain models within the [[the_future_of_work_and_remote_working | gig economy]] are more resilient to external shocks.

### Addressing Inequality Concerns
Concerns about inequality in the gig economy are valid, but it is crucial to recognize the different models at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[35:28]</a>. AirTasker aims to empower individuals by allowing them to define their work and pricing, fostering flexibility rather than commoditization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[37:53]</a>. The platform operates on a principle where it defines the mission (e.g., more completed jobs, low cancellations) and incentivizes taskers to figure out how to achieve these metrics, rather than micromanaging their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[39:07]</a>. This approach aims to create a mutually beneficial environment for both customers and taskers.

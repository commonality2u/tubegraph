Max, the founder of Superpower, is betting everything on the idea of creating a generational healthcare company, unlike any existing "Apple of healthcare" or "Amazon of healthcare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. The company recently raised a $30 million Series A, signaling a significant step towards realizing its vision of making high-end concierge medicine accessible and affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Max believes that to truly change healthcare, technology must be leveraged to process vast amounts of data, rather than relying solely on human doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## Superpower's Vision for Healthcare
Superpower's core vision is to transform a concierge medicine experience that might currently cost $50,000 or $100,000 into something that costs $500, or even eventually becomes free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. The company's approach involves three key parts:
1.  **Data Collection** Superpower aims to collect as much data on an individual as possible, including over 100 blood biomarkers, hormones, toxins, heart health, and liver health. This also involves pulling in past medical records to provide a comprehensive view of an individual's health in one place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. This emphasizes the [[importance of personalized healthcare solutions | importance of personalized healthcare solutions]].
2.  **Connecting the Dots with [[AI and its implications for society | AI]]** With the vast amount of health data, doctors typically lack the time to process it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Superpower uses [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] to connect these dots in "really interesting ways," identifying potential serious health issues down the road from current occurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This highlights [[the role of technology in healthcare improvement | the role of technology in healthcare improvement]]. Max states that three years ago, he believed "in the limit doctors would not exist and healthcare had to be solved as an informatics problem or a technology problem," essentially envisioning "[[AI and its implications for society | AI]] doctors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. The advent of [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] and large language models (like ChatGPT being used as a doctor) has helped seed this belief in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.
3.  **Facilitating Action** After collecting data and connecting the dots, Superpower makes it easy for individuals to take action. This means consolidating follow-up diagnostics, supplements, and prescriptions into one convenient platform, eliminating the need to search across multiple providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. This aspect focuses on the [[role of technology in healthcare accessibility | accessibility]] of solutions.

Max believes that people increasingly care about their health and will take proactive steps if given the right tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. The future goal is for [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] to perform tasks that humans never could, thereby "exceeding concierge medicine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## [[The impact of technology and AI on future industries and opportunities | Impact of AI on Future Industries and Employment]]
Max holds controversial views on the [[impact of ai on employment and the future of work | impact of AI on employment]]. He is "bearish" on white-collar professions, particularly junior roles such as lawyers, doctors (those not involved in physical tasks), accountants, bankers, advertisers, and marketers, as much of their "busy work and skill work" will become commoditized by [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. He posits that [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] "squares any output," meaning 1x output remains 1x, 2x becomes 4x, and 10x becomes 100x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. This phenomenon will increase inequality in the distribution of skills and talent, potentially necessitating a Universal Basic Income (UBI) because a 1x individual will be competing with a 100x individual assisted by [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. This vision underscores the importance of the [[future of jobs and skills in an AIdriven world | future of jobs and skills in an AI-driven world]].

Max also notes that this perspective is "antithetical" to how VCs have traditionally operated, focusing on high-gross margin, pure-play software businesses. He suggests that these very businesses are now most vulnerable to disruption, while lower-gross margin businesses with operational complexity (like Airbnb or Uber) may have stronger "moats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

## What Remains Important in an [[AI and its implications for society | AGI]] World
Max believes that in a "post-[[AI and its implications for society | AGI]] world," where information, skill, knowledge, and coding become commoditized, what remains scarce and important are:
*   **People and Relationships** "Tech bros are dead and the world will run on people bros," Max states, arguing that top figures like Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Jensen Huang are fundamentally "people bros" who understand the enduring value of human relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. Relationships between people will continue to be scarce and capable of unlocking defensible value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
*   **Real-World Interface** Companies that "interface with the real world" will become increasingly important as the cost of digital things approaches zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. This includes areas like deep tech, parts of healthcare involving real-world diagnostics and therapeutics, real estate, space, and hard sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. This relates to topics such as [[the future of food and ag tech innovations | agricultural technology innovations]] and other physically-based advancements.

Paul Bassat, co-founder of Square Peg Capital, is recognized as a significant figure in the startup and [[venture_capital_strategies_and_deal_winning | venture capital]] industry [01:46:01].

## Overview of Square Peg Capital
Square Peg Capital was established in 2012 [02:07:05], and as of the recording, it manages over three billion dollars in assets [02:11:03]. The firm has made significant [[key_investments_and_experiences_in_venture_capital | investments]] in companies such as Stripe, ROKT, Airwallex, and Canva [02:14:04].

## Investment Strategy
Square Peg Capital operates as a "high conviction investor," meaning they make fewer investments compared to other firms [02:08:04]. Paul Bassat notes that over three-quarters of their investments in the five years prior to the discussion were in pre-revenue businesses [02:17:09], citing examples like Airwallex, Zeller, Canva, Health Match, and OwnHome [02:21:05].

The firm strongly believes in the "power law" within venture capital, where a single investment in a fund can return the entire fund's capital [02:52:08]. Bassat asserts that it is very difficult to be a successful VC investor without at least one such outlier investment per fund [02:03:05].

Square Peg's approach differs from models like Tiger Global, which reduces friction and is valuation-insensitive, focusing on writing checks quickly [02:29:05]. It also contrasts with firms that write numerous checks, hoping a small number will emerge as successful [02:32:05]. Instead, Square Peg's strategy emphasizes a very high level of conviction [02:47:08]. They aim to back world-class founders who can grow and scale into amazing businesses that solve important problems [02:38:08]. If they don't feel as passionate about the business as the founders, they won't invest, considering it inauthentic [02:54:05].

## Global Presence
Square Peg Capital maintains a global presence with offices in Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, and Israel [02:22:04]. This geographic diversification is driven by two key factors:
1.  **Remarkable Founders**: The belief that these regions host truly exceptional founders [02:31:05].
2.  **Opportunity Entitlement**: The firm feels it has an "entitlement" to some of the best opportunities in these markets [02:38:08].

Technology and its business models are inherently global, not local [02:51:00]. Square Peg believes its global presence benefits founders by benchmarking them against the best globally [02:10:07]. This allows them to be more thematic in their [[venture_capital_strategies_and_deal_winning | investments]] [02:26:07].

Their primary thematic areas include:
*   Consumer internet [02:51:00]
*   SaaS (Software as a Service) [02:53:07]
*   Fintech [02:54:02]
*   Education [02:56:06]
*   Future of Work [02:56:06]
*   Digital Health [02:57:07]

These areas represent 80-90% of their [[key_investments_and_experiences_in_venture_capital | investing]] [02:58:01]. This thematic focus allows them to gain significant knowledge, build networks, and accumulate expertise, which compounds over time [02:04:08]. For example, their [[investment_strategies_in_unicorn_startups | investment]] in Stripe years ago, followed by Airwallex, Phoenix Cell, Pluang, Athena, and Zeller, has deepened their fintech domain knowledge [02:10:07].

Square Peg views itself similarly to a successful Australian startup that has ambitions to operate broadly, not just locally [02:58:01]. The learnings from more mature ecosystems like Israel, which has been successful for 30-40 years, are considered invaluable for contributing to the rapidly developing Australian ecosystem [02:13:00].

## Differentiating in the Evolving VC Landscape
Paul Bassat observes that the venture capital world has undergone a dramatic transformation over the last 15 years [03:34:04]. It was once a "cozy world" centered around the US, with firms investing locally [03:09:05]. However, there has been a "democratization of [[venture_capital_strategies_and_deal_winning | venture capital]]" geographically, with remarkable businesses emerging from Europe, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Australia [03:11:02].

Today, for a new VC fund, the biggest barrier to entry is raising capital [03:32:05]. To differentiate, a firm must understand where the market is headed, rather than copying past models [03:49:01]. Differentiation should not be for its own sake, nor should it be merely contrarian; it must be "smart and contrarian," meaning disagreeing with others and being right [03:42:07].

Bassat welcomes increased competition in the Australian VC market, stating that the market does not have an "excess of capital problem" [03:05:04]. More funds are desirable for the health of the Australian startup ecosystem [03:07:05].

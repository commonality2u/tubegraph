The journey of building a successful business, particularly a tech startup, is rarely a "Rosy Road" where "everything goes up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It inherently involves [[the_balance_of_risk_and_ambition_in_building_tech_startups | balancing risk and ambition]], requiring founders to make strategic decisions that prioritize both growth and sustainability.

## Early Stages: High-Conviction, [[importance_of_creativity_and_risktaking | Risk-Taking]]

In the initial phases, a high level of conviction in the product or service is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Faro, co-founder of Slice (formerly PayatTravel), highlights that their early strategy wasn't "going in blind and throwing money," but rather a data-driven approach with strong conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### Bootstrapping and Personal Investment
Without external funding, early [[entrepreneurship_and_risk_management_strategies | entrepreneurship and risk management strategies]] for Slice involved significant personal financial commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   **Initial Capital:** Co-founders pooled their savings and even took out personal credit cards to fund tickets and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This was done with high conviction, understanding customer acquisition costs, payback periods, and average losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Sacrifices:** Faro paid himself only $400 a week for a period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Later, he sold his car, and his co-founder refinanced his house to fund expansion into the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. This willingness to "go down swinging" was driven by the belief that another car could always be acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   **Personal Risk:** All debt was personally guaranteed, placing the founders "at the risk of bankruptcy" for the first four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

### Lean Product Development and Validation
Instead of building complex tech early, Slice started with a "very simple MVP" (Minimum Viable Product): a WordPress landing page with a form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Customer inquiries were processed manually by a hired assistant, and bookings were taken over the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   This approach, known as "doing things that don't scale," allowed them to quickly validate customer demand and build conviction before investing heavily in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This demonstrates a core principle in [[product_development_and_innovation_in_tech_startups | product development and innovation in tech startups]]: understand the pain point and validate it quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Navigating Crisis: Preparedness and Controlled Response

The business faced an extreme crisis with COVID-19, which caused 95% of its revenue to evaporate almost overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

### Preparation for Adversity
Faro's advice for founders navigating a crisis is to "prepare before the crisis happens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. He emphasized:
*   **Learning from Hardship:** Reading books about individuals who endured "hardcore battles" helped him understand human endurance and realize that perceived limits are often underestimated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   **Philosophy and Principles:** Studying stoicism instilled principles like focusing on what can be controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. During COVID-19, this meant focusing on customer care and strategic next moves, rather than "whining about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
*   **Assumption of Crisis:** Founders should assume that crises will "definitely happen" when running a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

### Strategic Response During COVID-19
Despite the severe impact, the company made conscious decisions:
*   **Customer Focus:** Prioritizing customer refunds and credits to protect the brand's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **Calculated Expansion:** While relying on government support (JobKeeper), they decided to expand into the US market by analyzing flight data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This quick decision led them back to pre-COVID numbers within three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Risk: Opportunity vs. Omission

Faro believes that risk is "often overpriced" in Australian society, which he sees as "quite risk averse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. His approach involves balancing an "all-in" mentality with preparedness for hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

### Understanding Different Types of Risk
*   **Regret Minimization:** For Faro, the risk of "regretting down the line" by not pursuing an opportunity seemed greater than the risk of losing savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. This highlights the concept of "risk of omission" versus "risk of commission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.
*   **Smart vs. Foolish Risk:** It's not about "blindly taking stupid risks" but rather understanding the upside and downside, making "smarter bets" based on data and customer demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. Successful bets should ideally "outperform the losing bets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>.
*   **Enjoying Risk:** Faro finds that he "enjoys risk" and "seeks out risk," associating it with reward when "done smartly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   **Long-Term View:** A long-term perspective generally leads to being "more risk on," while still "covering the downside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

### The Power of "Going All In"
Going "all in" can trigger creativity and resourcefulness, forcing individuals to find solutions when their "backs against the rope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. The lack of early capital forced Slice to have "so much skin in the game" and Sweat Equity, increasing conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.

## Evolving Risk Strategy with Growth: "Pirate Mode" and Downside Protection

As Slice grew and raised a significant seed round, the approach to risk management evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.

### Differentiated Risk Appetites
With two parts of the business (PayatTravel, the established B2C; and Slice Pay, a newer product), there's a need to differentiate risk strategies:
*   **PayatTravel (Mothership):** Requires mitigating risk, dotting the "eyes and crossing the tees" (approx. 70% upside creation, 30% downside protection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.
*   **"Pirate Mode" (New Products/Expansions):** New opportunities or market expansions are treated as "exploration projects" where teams can be "very risk on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. This involves a 95% upside creation and 5% downside protection approach, encouraging rapid validation and willingness to "cut corners" to achieve wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. The core idea is to avoid letting the "big Mothership slow down the exploration projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

### Balancing Entrepreneurial Drive with Professionalism
As CEO, Faro faces the evolving challenge of balancing the "hyper founder mode" with the need to be more "professional" and rigid in some cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:37:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. This means finding the balance to ensure growth initiatives aren't hampered by excessive conservatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>. This is a key aspect of [[challenges_and_reflections_in_business_decision_making | challenges and reflections in business decision making]].

## Instilling Culture: Scaling Innovation and Risk-Taking

As the company scales (from 4 to 80 team members), maintaining the entrepreneurial DNA and risk-taking culture is a critical challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. This relates directly to [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_culture | challenges and strategies in startup culture]].

### Proactive Culture Building
*   **Communicating Principles:** Faro is actively communicating the importance of prioritizing "upside creation" (90%) over "downside protection" (10%) for a fast-growth venture business, contrasting it with a bank's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. The goal is to "win" first and foremost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>.
*   **Documentation:** To ensure principles are not "watered down" as the company grows, Faro is documenting these principles in Notion, envisioning a future where a team of 500 can consult "notion AI" for decision-making guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a>. This minimizes reliance on constant meetings and allows for scalable decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.
*   **Surrounding with Right People:** He emphasizes surrounding himself with people who "compensate for the areas where I'm not so good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to build an "organization that can actually be there for the next 20 years," potentially becoming a public company, while maintaining its speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.

## Fred Schebesta's Vision for Crypto

Fred Schebesta demonstrates his strong belief in the power of [[the_rise_of_cryptocurrency_and_decentralized_finance_defi | cryptocurrency]] by offering free Bitcoin to people who get vaccinated as a means to help end the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. His active engagement extends to exploring emerging areas like [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_nft_gaming_industry | Axi Infinity]], where he strategized late into the night on building a business and making money within the game, highlighting the lucrative possibilities in [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_nft_gaming_industry | NFT gaming]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

Schebesta sees the world on the verge of a "full metaverse" transition, accelerated by global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:39:00">[26:39:00]</a>. He notes that people are already earning more money playing games in the metaverse than they might in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:58:00">[26:58:00]</a>. This shift, he believes, will profoundly influence the distribution of wealth and income in many societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:58:00">[27:58:00]</a>.

Schebesta is "extremely optimistic" about the future of technology and its impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06:00">[28:06:00]</a>. He anticipates a future where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robots lead to the implementation of Universal Basic Income (UBI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>. This, he suggests, could usher in a new "renaissance," allowing humanity to flourish in arts and culture as financial concerns become less prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>. With more automation, human focus will shift from repetitive tasks to creative endeavors and entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:18:00">[30:18:00]</a>.

## Bitcoin's Enduring Role

Schebesta views Bitcoin as a "battle-tested" and "resilient" asset, having witnessed its fluctuations, including a dip to $3,800 and a rise to $64,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:36:00">[39:36:00]</a>. He asserts that Bitcoin serves as the underlying "hard money" backing the entire [[the_rise_of_cryptocurrency_and_decentralized_finance_defi | cryptocurrency]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:26:00">[42:26:00]</a>. Fundamentally, as Bitcoin's value moves, so do most other cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:35:00">[42:35:00]</a>.

For newcomers to the [[the_rise_of_cryptocurrency_and_decentralized_finance_defi | cryptocurrency]] space, Schebesta recommends starting with Bitcoin, calling it a "gateway drug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:00">[43:55:00]</a>. He advises buying a small amount and experiencing it firsthand, as this often leads to a deeper exploration of the wider crypto ecosystem, including concepts like [[the_rise_of_cryptocurrency_and_decentralized_finance_defi | DeFi]] and [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_nft_gaming_industry | NFTs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:19:00">[41:19:00]</a>.

The rapid growth of different altcoins, like the rise and fall of EOS or the persistence of Ethereum despite "Ethereum killers," showcases the dynamic nature of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:17:00">[40:17:00]</a>.

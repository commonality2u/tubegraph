Alicia McDonald, a partner at AirTree Ventures, one of Australia's largest funds, shares insights into venture capital strategies, her approach to deal-making, and the qualities she seeks in founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Known for her blend of sharp intellect and high empathy, McDonald emphasizes a balanced approach to her demanding career and personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. AirTree's core value, "there's more to life," resonates deeply with her personal philosophy of achieving success without sacrificing a full life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Core Values and Professional Philosophy

McDonald values authenticity, stating that her goal is for people to not be shocked when they meet her, as she strives not to project an image that isn't true to herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. She deeply values authenticity, achievement, family, and being a good parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. Her drive for achievement is internal, not motivated by external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. She feels a profound obligation to achieve as much as she can and be as happy as possible to honor her late mother's legacy and sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

Her high tolerance for stress, described by her spouse as being "a machine," stems from being a driven and ambitious person who thrives in busy environments and easily gets bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. A challenging childhood, where her mother battled brain cancer from McDonald's early age, provided her with a profound perspective on life's stresses, making everyday worries seem minuscule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This experience instilled in her a "glass half full" outlook and immense resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Venture Capital Strategies

### Gaining an Edge in a Competitive Landscape
In an increasingly [[challenges_and_strategies_in_venture_investing | competitive venture capital market]], McDonald's key strategy to gain an edge is to "find the deals that no one else is looking at" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>. She prefers finding "rough diamonds" and companies in overlooked spaces, believing that the best early-stage investments are often contrarian and not immediately obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. She is passionate about investing outside of "cliquey circles" and welcomes outreach from anyone, regardless of their network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.

### Approach to Deal Winning
When it comes to winning a competitive deal, McDonald prioritizes understanding the company's specific needs and whether AirTree can genuinely add value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. She believes in the "product" of AirTree but acknowledges they are not the right fund for every founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.

A successful deal, where AirTree won despite proposing slightly lower terms, was attributed to **trust** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. This trust was built through an ongoing relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. McDonald's approach involves:
*   **Empathy and honesty**: She strives to help founders cut through the noise by offering honest advice about pros and cons, even if it doesn't always favor AirTree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. This demonstrates what it would be like to work with her, fostering a long-term relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.
*   **"Sales-led origination" vs. "marketing-led origination"**: She focuses on substance and direct connection rather than constant public commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. She prefers to build her brand and reputation on "what I do versus what I say," through interactions behind closed doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Sales experience**: Her background in B2B sales at LinkedIn provides her with operational experience and empathy for founders holding quotas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. She notes that [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | venture capital]] itself involves significant sales, from pitching to founders, to convincing investment committees, and raising capital from LPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.

> [!TIP] **Advice for Founders in First Meetings:**
> *   **Demonstrate passion**: Authentic passion for solving a problem cannot be faked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
> *   **Show unique positioning**: Explain why *you* are uniquely positioned to solve this specific problem and why you have an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.
> *   **Tell your story**: Spend time on your background and how it led you to discover the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. This is crucial at the early stage, as the business is a "derivative of that person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.
> *   **Engage in conversation**: If a deck has been pre-read, use the time for a genuine conversation to get to know each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.

## Founder Evaluation

### Key Qualities in Founders
McDonald identifies several critical traits she looks for in founders:
*   **Deep passion**: This indicates an intrinsic motivation that will lead to resilience when facing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
*   **Resilience**: Building a business is difficult with many setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>. Founders need enough genuine passion to navigate adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.
*   **Self-awareness**: Great founders understand their strengths and weaknesses ("where they spike") and hire complementary skill sets to fill gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.
*   **Ability to inspire**: Founders need to inspire others to join them on their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.

McDonald emphasizes that investors are not looking for perfection or a polished pitch, but rather for genuine drive and self-awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

### Founder Relationships and Support
McDonald highlights the importance of a strong support system for founders, particularly a trusting partner with whom they can be vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. She notes the complexity for husband-and-wife teams in drawing boundaries between work and home life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>. Having a partner outside the industry can offer refreshing perspective, but also requires effort to bring them up to speed on context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>. As an investor, McDonald aims to be a source of support, allowing founders to share tough times when they cannot with employees or all investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.

### Work-Life Balance in Venture Capital
McDonald actively demonstrates that it's possible to be a senior [[venture_capital_perspectives_and_founderfirst_investing | venture capitalist]] and have a full life outside of work, having raised three children since starting in VC eight years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This balance is a core value at AirTree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. She advises young ambitious women to:
*   **Find the right company**: One whose values align with your own, particularly regarding work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.
*   **Love what you do**: If you don't love your job, it will be hard to return to it after having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>.
*   **Think tactically about finances**: Consider childcare costs as a shared household expense, not just against one salary, and plan for superannuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

Ultimately, she believes that finding a company where personal and professional values align is key to achieving a fulfilling career and family life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

Finding the "best" founders is a critical aspect of venture capital, particularly for early-stage investors like Sam Wong, a Partner at [[Challenges and strategies in venture investing | Blackbird Ventures]], one of Australia's largest venture firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. The firm's mantra revolves around investing in "wild hearts with the wildest of ideas," emphasizing belief in people even before they fully believe in themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

## Qualities of Exceptional Founders

Sam Wong highlights several [[Key qualities of successful founders | key qualities of successful founders]] that differentiate them in the highly competitive startup ecosystem:

*   **Curiosity and Building Aptitude** Founders often exhibit a deep curiosity and a drive to learn and build new things, frequently engaging in side projects or not-for-profits before their main ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
*   **Unique Insight and Magic** The best founders possess a singular insight into a problem or opportunity, coupled with an intangible "magic" that sets them apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.
*   **Bravery to Build** They are brave enough to take the leap from observation to action, stepping off the sidelines to build their vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   **Whole Self to Work** Successful venture capitalists, and by extension, the founders they invest in, often bring their entire personality and authentic self to their work. This is crucial in an industry driven by curiosity and building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   **Life's Work Mentality** Founders who view their company as their "life's work" have often already thoroughly considered ethical implications and challenges, ensuring their company's building process reflects deep thoughtfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.
*   **Extraordinary Velocity and Output** A key indicator is the ability to achieve extraordinary progress with very limited resources, often demonstrating impatience and high output given minimal input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.
    *   This "velocity of progress" is measured by seeing extreme outlier signals, such as building and selling a complex product (like an IVF embryo detection AI) within months while simultaneously completing a medical degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>.
*   **Talent Magnetism** The capacity to attract and magnetize exceptional talent, even when the company is merely an idea, is vital. This early talent creates a positive compounding effect, increasing the probability of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding Problem and Customer** Founders must deeply understand the problems they are solving and the customers they are serving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.
*   **Awareness of Bias and "Weirdness"** While pattern recognition is useful, investors must be aware of their own biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>. Often, the most disruptive companies and founders have a "weirdness" or something slightly off-kilter that makes them different and potentially category-defining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Investor Evaluation

Sam Wong's approach to evaluating founders and companies has evolved, focusing on specific strategies:

*   **Early-Stage Focus** As a seed-stage investor, the focus is on people first, as companies are built by individuals, not themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.
*   **Partnership Approach** Blackbird views itself as a partner to founders and an investor in companies. This means joining founders on their journey, providing belief and money, and maintaining humility, recognizing that founders will always know their business and customers far better than any investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. The goal is to surround founders with data to help them make informed decisions and allow them to learn from their own successes and mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.
*   **Ethical Considerations (ESG)** Blackbird incorporates ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) concerns into its investment decision-making process. This involves early conversations with founders about how their vision might accelerate both positive and negative societal impacts, often unlocking non-obvious positive potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.
*   **Pattern Matching** Experience allows for "pattern matching" and observing a high volume of companies, enabling investors to stack-rank founders based on their ability to achieve significant results with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>.
*   **Measuring Early-Stage Velocity** Since traditional metrics like revenue and user growth are lagging indicators, Sam looks for extraordinary progress and subtle hints of brilliance. This comes from seeing a lot of companies and identifying "extreme outlier" signals in their early development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.
*   **Active Listening** A significant personal learning for Sam has been to be "much quieter" when talking to founders, actively trying to quieten herself and listen more to avoid planting ideas or words in their mouths that aren't truly their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:00]</a>. The principle is "listen twice, speak once" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:00]</a>.
*   **Learning from Losses** While venture capital has a high loss rate, Sam focuses on learning from those instances, but also emphasizes the importance of "doubling down on winners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:11:00">[22:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>. She notes that "hustle and grit" are important but won't necessarily lead to 100x outcomes; market conditions, luck, and the ability to attract the right team are also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>.

## Identifying New Thematics

Instead of actively seeking out companies within predefined themes, Sam Wong primarily observes where [[Key qualities of successful founders | high-quality founders]] are directing their efforts and energies, letting that guide her interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>. She acknowledges that if a concept is already widely recognized as a "trend," it's likely too late for a seed-stage investor to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:57:00">[36:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:33:00">[37:33:00]</a>.

Current areas of interest that stem from observing founder activity include:

*   **Designing for Neurodiverse Experiences** Creating software, especially work-based experiences, with neurodiverse conditions like ADHD or autism in mind. This not only promotes inclusivity but can also improve productivity for the general population affected by increasing distractibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:52:00">[28:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31:00">[29:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>.
*   **Markets as a Service** Exploring how technology can enable new markets to form and operate where they were previously uneconomical due to high costs, slow processes, or lack of transparency. Examples include financing products for climate change transition at a granular level (e.g., small-scale regenerative agriculture investments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:53:00">[30:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:02:00">[31:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>. This also applies to [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_culture | EdTech]] companies enabling reskilling for individuals in industries that have disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:00">[32:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:57:00">[32:57:00]</a>.
*   **Deeper into Biology (beyond healthcare)** Investing in innovations in biology that are not strictly healthcare, such as future food, high-value materials, and other related fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:22:00">[33:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:24:00">[33:24:00]</a>.
*   **Laggard Commerce** Identifying goods and services that are not yet truly digital experiences, and where current technologies can bring these "lagged" industries online, such as the offline auto parts market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:35:00">[33:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:40:00">[33:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:58:00">[33:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36:00">[34:36:00]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Founders

For young people interested in tech and startups, Sam Wong advises to "just do stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:20:00">[38:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:22:00">[38:22:00]</a>. This includes:

*   **Building and Experimenting** Actively build things, even small projects, at university or in their spare time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:39:00">[38:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:15:00">[39:15:00]</a>.
*   **Asking for Money (Selling)** Overcoming the cultural hesitancy in Australia and New Zealand to ask customers for money, as this is the ultimate validator of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:50:00">[38:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:01:00">[39:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:42:00">[39:42:00]</a>.
*   **Embracing "No"** Being ready to hear "no" is a gift, as it helps founders understand who their potential customers are and who says "yes" quickly, even to an early or "ugly" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:00">[39:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:09:00">[40:09:00]</a>.
*   **Practical Experience over Theory** There's no way to "theory your way" into startups or investing; direct experience is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:06:00">[39:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:10:00">[39:10:00]</a>.

> "Write ridiculously small checks, build small projects and ask people to pay you like it's the only way and that's how you'll learn what you what you like doing as well." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:14:00">[39:14:00]</a>

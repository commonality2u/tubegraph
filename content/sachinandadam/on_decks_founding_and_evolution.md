On Deck, co-founded by David Booth, emerged as one of the world's largest education companies, making significant waves with its community product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. It aimed to connect [[founders_motivations_and_personal_histories|Founders]] and aspiring [[founders_motivations_and_personal_histories|Founders]], ultimately helping to launch over a thousand companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Pandemic-Era Boom

On Deck's rapid growth was significantly boosted by the onset of the pandemic. As the world shifted to remote work and sought new ways to connect and build professional relationships, On Deck was a "fortunate beneficiary" of these tailwinds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The company gained massive organic viral traction on Twitter from late 2020 to mid-2021, with many people openly advocating for its programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This success stemmed from creating a platform where people felt proud to belong and were empowered to build their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. On Deck capitalized on the prevailing "zeitgeist" where people were actively seeking connection, hope, and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

Originally anchored to in-person experiences, the impending pandemic brought a moment of "terror" as events faced cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. However, On Deck swiftly pivoted to virtual cohorts, successfully replicating the magic of offline retreats, curated dinners, and one-on-one interactions online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This accidental shift led to the popularization of cohort-based communities and courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

On Deck's approach was distinct, focusing on "returning the community to the classroom" through peer-to-peer learning rather than just content consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. This model emphasized shared experiences, building relationships, and mutual achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. The community was often defined by those *not* included, focusing on specific "jobs to be done" and welcoming those who had "done the work" to qualify for its various fellowships, such as Founder, Product Manager, Engineering, Climate, and Fintech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Scaling and Challenges

At its peak, On Deck rapidly scaled its team from around five pre-pandemic to over 200 members, who worked remotely across 40 countries and 30 states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. This expansion was fueled by significant capital, including over $100 million in total funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. A notable investment came from Tiger Global in mid-2021, a rapid deal where $100 million was offered shortly after initial conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. This capital was partly used for the company and partly for an accelerator fund, ODX, to provide early capital to [[founders_motivations_and_personal_histories|Founders]] starting their journeys with On Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

The belief at the time was in "blitzscaling" and a "land grab" in the cohort-based course market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. On Deck built out approximately 37 individual communities, each serving a specific persona and interlocking to form a "campus" or "mesh" of communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>. These included cohorts for product managers, engineers, marketers, and even industry-specific groups like healthcare, longevity tech, and education, aiming to connect aspiring [[founders_motivations_and_personal_histories|Founders]] with potential co-founders or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.

However, market conditions shifted dramatically in early 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>, with three key factors contributing to On Deck's challenges:
1.  **Return to In-Person**: The vaccine rollout allowed people to resume in-person activities, reducing the demand for digital communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.
2.  **Economic Downturn**: The collapse of the crypto and tech bubbles in May 2022 led to cuts in corporate learning and development budgets (affecting On Deck's B2B arm) and a drying up of consumer discretionary spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>.
3.  **Company Structure**: On Deck's ambitious expansion led to a complex structure with three different business units (careers, recruiting, startups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>. The startup unit had forgone revenue in anticipation of large fund management fees, but LP capital for the fund dried up as the market shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.

These factors necessitated significant restructuring, including two rounds of layoffs, reducing the team from 350 to around 80 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. Some business units were spun out, allowing teams to build independently rather than being laid off, such as the talent team forming a new company to help people find jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.

## Current Evolution

After the intense period of growth and contraction, On Deck scaled back to focus on three core "business bets": a "LinkedIn for ambitious people" directory product, a recruiting marketplace, and a small fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

The company has now returned to its roots, emphasizing building relationships offline and growing networks online, with a focus on San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. The current model involves intensive week-long in-person retreats for cohorts of around 120 people, particularly those quitting their jobs to start their [[founders_motivations_and_personal_histories|Founder]] journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. This model prioritizes being "around people you can draw energy from" and "build your conviction with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>.

## Leadership and Philosophy

David Booth's experience with On Deck significantly expanded his capacity for "constructively navigating chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. He learned to lead executive teams and identify "shortcuts" in business development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. The journey taught him the importance of balancing ambition with personal life, aiming to "build my ambition around my life as opposed to my life around my ambition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>.

The [[challenges_and_experiences_of_cofounders|co-founder relationship]] at On Deck, particularly with Eric Torenberg, was described as symbiotic. Booth viewed himself as the "force of order" to Torenberg's "force of chaos," with Torenberg's energy and network driving bigger, faster initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>. This balance was crucial for their [[building_company_culture_and_founder_mindset|working relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.

On Deck's approach to identifying promising [[founders_motivations_and_personal_histories|Founders]] involved collecting extensive data points from their participation in the community, providing deeper insights than typical VC due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>. Booth emphasizes "hyperfluency"—a [[founder_experiences_and_strategies_in_tech_startups|Founder]]'s ability to discuss a subject in a way that energizes and informs others, regardless of the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.

A core philosophy guiding On Deck, and one Booth continues to advocate for, is "The Golden Rule of Silicon Valley": treating people as if they are the next unicorn [[founders_motivations_and_personal_histories|Founder]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. The belief is that being helpful to others now can lead to future opportunities, whether through investment, references, or employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:36">[00:56:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. This means taking young people seriously and providing honest, constructive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. This approach requires creating programs and communities that can efficiently scale support for early-stage [[founders_motivations_and_personal_histories|Founders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a>.

Seek, founded by Paul Bassat, his brother Andrew, and Matt Rockman, emerged as one of Australia's earliest and most successful internet businesses, growing into a multi-billion dollar company that eventually IPO'd and is now valued at eight billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:50">[01:50:50]</a>. Seek will celebrate its 25th anniversary later in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:15">[12:22:15]</a>.

## Founding and Initial Vision
The founders of Seek were confident that employment advertising, like real estate and automotive classifieds, would transition from print to online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:07">[13:26:07]</a>. While others were operating online in Australia, none had achieved critical mass in the employment sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:13">[13:39:13]</a>. The shift to online felt "incredibly obvious" to the Seek team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:19">[16:39:19]</a>.

## The Cold Start Problem
A significant [[Challenges and strategies in startup execution and marketing | challenge]] for marketplace businesses like Seek is the "cold start problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:02">[12:28:02]</a>. This means starting with no job seekers and no job advertisements, which are both essential for critical mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:40">[12:42:40]</a>. Historically, people found jobs by going to newspapers like The Age or The Sydney Morning Herald <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:12">[13:11:12]</a>.

Some competitors and others did not initially believe the internet was the right medium for employment advertising, even years after Seek started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:16">[17:15:16]</a>. One newspaper publisher famously stated that "you can't read the internet on the toilet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:18">[17:28:18]</a>.

## Growth Strategy
To overcome the cold start problem and achieve [[Rapid company growth and expansion strategies | rapid company growth]], Seek implemented several key [[Strategies for rapid growth and success in startups | strategies for rapid growth and success]]:

*   **Price as a Lever** The company used price aggressively to attract job ads, ensuring nothing prevented ads from moving online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:47">[14:04:47]</a>.
*   **Early Adopters and Manual Entry** Chandler Macleod, a recruitment firm, became Seek's first major advertiser, paying little to nothing (around $500 a month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:03">[14:18:03]</a>. They faxed 300 ads, which the Seek team manually typed out over a weekend to go live on March 16, 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:30">[14:48:30]</a>.
*   **Supplementary to Primary Medium** Seek initially positioned itself as a supplementary medium, not asking employers to abandon newspaper advertising, but rather to add Seek to their existing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:12">[15:17:12]</a>. This strategy allowed businesses to integrate Seek without disrupting their existing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:45">[15:23:45]</a>. Over time, as Seek gained traction, clients realized they no longer needed print, leading to a significant decrease in print ad spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:13">[15:39:13]</a>.
*   **Focus on Volume** The priority was always to attract volume on both the job seeker and advertiser sides, particularly the latter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:21">[15:01:21]</a>. The "flywheel effect" of job seekers attracting employers, and more job ads attracting more job seekers, was key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:17">[13:46:17]</a>.

## Navigating Market Downturns

Seek's journey included navigating the dot-com crash. After raising money at a $100 million valuation just before the crash in 2000, Seek raised funds at the same valuation two and a half years later in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:34:00">[34:34:00]</a>. Despite the market indicating no value creation during this period, Paul Bassat believes 2000-2003 was "the single most important value creation period" for the company, laying foundations for future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:37:16">[35:37:16]</a>. This resilience allowed Seek to IPO in 2005 at a $700 million valuation and reach $3 billion a few years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:10:00">[35:10:00]</a>.

This experience highlights that a downturn, if a business is well-capitalized and has a strong model, can be an opportunity to build an "enduring and really durable business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:53:14">[35:53:14]</a>. The key is to grow revenue, as young startups "cannot shrink your way to greatness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:07">[36:31:07]</a>. However, this growth must be sustainable, with unit economics that make sense, unlike the "growth at any cost" mindset that can sometimes prevail in venture markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:02:18">[37:02:18]</a>. The goal is to "compound growth at a really good rate for 20 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:18:01">[38:18:01]</a>.

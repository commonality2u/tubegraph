From: [[sachinandadam]] <br/> 

Sovereignty and sovereign capability refer to a nation's ability to produce its own defense goods and make independent decisions regarding its security. For Australia, lacking this capability means being dependent on other nations for defense needs, primarily the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Current State of Australian Defense
Australia's defense budget is substantial, annually ranging between 50 and 55 billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Globally, this places Australia 13th in terms of direct spending and approximately 8th per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. Despite this significant investment, Australia has almost no companies ranked in the top 100 global defense companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, with Austal being the sole Australian company, fluctuating between 75th and 91st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. This indicates a heavy reliance on overseas technology procurement, particularly from the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

The dependence on allies, such as the US through alliances like AUKUS, implies that if the US engages in conflict, Australia is likely to be drawn in too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This dependence can lead to a lack of autonomy in geopolitical decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>. A key concern is that a significant portion of Australia's defense spending effectively flows to US states that produce defense materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>, rather than fostering domestic capability.

## The Push for Sovereign Capability
The primary motivation for establishing sovereign capability is to enable Australia to make its own defense decisions and avoid being unwillingly drawn into conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. By building up its own defense industry, Australia aims to gain greater autonomy and choice in its geopolitical engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.

This drive is also fueled by a desire to prevent a situation where Australians might be forced to join the military due to external threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>. The objective is to make Australia "spikier" and harder to "digest" for potential adversaries, akin to a porcupine or Akida strategy, making it a less appealing target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.

## Innovation in Australian Defense Technology
There is a perceived need to revolutionize the military-industrial complex, which is seen as outdated and inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. The argument is that while criticism from afar is possible, it is more impactful to "get in there and do something about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.

Innovation, particularly in the private sector, is crucial for fostering new defense technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>. Unlike general government functions (roads, rates, rubbish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>, defense technology is better developed by businesses, potentially with public sector assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.

A key area of focus for new ventures is foundational technologies like solid rocket propellant and solid rocket motors, which have seen little change in decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>. The current backlog in defense manufacturing, estimated at $500 billion across the top three US defense primes, is largely attributed to a shortage of these components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

The cost to innovate and build in the defense sector is considered cheaper today due to advancements in technology (e.g., website creation, marketing software, backend services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. This allows for a focus on scale and efficiency in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

## Arguments Against Sovereign Capability
Arguments against a strong sovereign defense capability often include:
*   **Focus on Diplomacy:** The belief that peace should be pursued through diplomacy rather than increased military production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>. However, some argue that effective diplomacy requires a strong defense posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>.
*   **Incumbent Dominance:** Large, established prime defense contractors argue that they can cover all needs, discouraging investment in smaller, more innovative companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Allies:** The argument that Australia, given its smaller population, should continue to rely on larger allies like the US for defense technology and aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>.

There is also a perceived lack of patriotism among some young people, questioning the necessity of fighting in potential wars or investing in defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>. However, optimists argue that when truly challenged, Australians would value and seek to preserve their way of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.

## Personal Motivation
Individuals driven to develop sovereign capability often express a personal commitment to solving challenging problems that others avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>. The motivation is often rooted in personal experiences, such as having refugee parents who fled war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. The hope is to prevent future generations from experiencing the hardships of war, with the ultimate goal that the developed defense technologies are never actually used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.

## The Future
The goal of pursuing sovereign capability in defense is to build a self-sufficient Australia capable of producing its own essential goods, from energy to defense needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>. This self-reliance would provide greater autonomy in geopolitical decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. The expectation is an unfortunate proliferation of defense companies, driven by perceived necessity and a growing willingness among talented individuals to engage in this challenging sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>. This shift aims to direct brilliant minds towards mission-driven technologies like defense and healthcare, rather than solely commercial pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56">[01:20:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:59">[01:20:59]</a>.

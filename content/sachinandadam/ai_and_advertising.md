[[Relevance AIs journey and strategy | Cutable]], a platform co-founded by Jack White and Sam Krenberg, is leveraging [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] to transform the advertising industry and bring back the "golden age of advertising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. The core concept allows clients to brief the platform, which then generates ads for them to publish, for which they pay a monthly fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Sam Krenberg, who previously sold A Cloud Guru for $2 billion, brings extensive tech experience, while Jack White grew up immersed in Australia's top ad agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

## The Disruption of Traditional Advertising
Jack White observed that traditional ad agencies failed to adapt to the rise of digital and social media channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Campaigns designed for 60-second TV spots were merely "chopped down" and "stuck" into social channels, treating them like TV, even as mobile devices became ubiquitous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. This approach led to "internet garbage" filled with "terrible ads" that no one wanted to watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The problem was that agencies neglected the "low to mid-funnel" channels, which became the focus of [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

## Cutable's Philosophy: Quality and Quantity in Advertising
Cutable aims to fix the issue of poor online advertising by lifting creative people up to do more creative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. Their core motto is not to perfect a single ad but to create an "ad set" with a dozen different concepts, letting the algorithm decide what works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. This approach generates both the necessary quantity for algorithms and the quality needed to capture audience attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

### The Role of [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] in Advertising
*   **AI as a Tool** [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] is viewed as a tool that changes the tools designers use, rather than making design obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. It allows more people to engage in creation, potentially leading to better creative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
*   **The "Human Generated" Premium** Humans innately crave recognition and appreciation from other humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. Content known to be [[AI and its implications for society | AI]]-generated is rated less highly than human-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. This suggests that platforms might eventually need to label content as human-generated, creating a premium for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.
*   **The "Craft" Advantage** While [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] makes creation easier, "craft still wins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. The more content is created, the less valuable it becomes, but genuine craft will rise to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   **AI for Testing and Learning** [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] can support humans by speeding up the testing of creative variables, helping to make the final leap to effective ads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.
*   **The Challenge of Innovation** An open question remains whether [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] can push the state-of-the-art forward in creativity or merely replicate existing content really well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. Cutable believes that understanding patterns of what works allows for the creation of unique and effective content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.

### Competitive Advantage
Cutable's competitive advantage lies in its unique methodology, modeled on how the best agencies produce ads, with advertising industry experts building their [[strategic approach to AI and machine learning in customer support | approach to AI]] in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. By continuously running and testing ads, Cutable learns what resonates with a brand's audience, building an understanding of its "DNA" and "tone of voice" across different channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>.

## Strategic Pivot and Mindset
Cutable recently underwent a significant pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. Initially, they were pulled towards working with large brands, but these companies often adhered to traditional advertising mindsets that hindered scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. They redefined their ideal customer profile (ICP) based on an "experimental," "progressive mindset" rather than company size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>. This pivot allowed them to focus on businesses that were already building their companies on social media and prioritizing rapid ad deployment for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>.

### Challenges in the [[the_competitive_landscape_for_AI_startups | Competitive Landscape for AI Startups]]
Winning in the [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] advertising space is fundamentally difficult due to:
*   **Servicing Large Brands** Difficulties in adapting traditional workflows and mindsets to new [[leveraging_ai_tools_in_communication_strategies | AI tools]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.
*   **Merging Engineering and Creative Teams** Bridging the gap between the structured, box-oriented thinking of engineers and the interconnected, intuitive thinking of creatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.
*   **Constant Adaptation to [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] Models** The rapid evolution of [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] requires continuous product development to keep up with new capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>.

Companies like Icon and Canva are also entering this space, but Cutable asserts that simply generating large quantities of "internet garbage" without a deep understanding of advertising creative will not win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. The key is to make "better ads" that resonate and provide entertainment, rather than just optimizing clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.

### The "Long View" and Quality Product
Cutable is taking a "long view" approach, prioritizing a quality product over early market share and rapid revenue generation, aligning with advice from Duolingo's founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. This means investing time in developing a robust methodology for ad creation, even if it delays public launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. They believe that a quality product ultimately wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>.

## Building the Team and Culture
Recruiting the right talent is crucial. Cutable seeks:
*   **Open-minded Engineers** Engineers who are comfortable with uncertainty and experimentation, as [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] doesn't always think like humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.
*   **Adaptable Creative Professionals** Advertising professionals who can systematize their processes and be flexible with established frameworks when working with [[AI and its implications for society | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>.

The company focuses on defining clear, specific quarterly objectives, ensuring all teams are "focused on solving one problem" to gain speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:11">[00:57:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. They measure success using metrics like Product Market Fit (PMF), asking how disappointed customers would be if Cutable no longer existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>.

## Future Vision
The ultimate vision for Cutable is to "create a world where people actually do enjoy watching ads again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>. This involves focusing on good ideas, good creative, and entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>. They believe that if the methodology for writing an ad is strong, they can then integrate advanced generative video and other [[AI agents and their practical applications in business | AI agents]] as they mature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>. The founders are driven by a passion for solving hard problems and the camaraderie of building a company together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>.

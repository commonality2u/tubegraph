Ben Thompson, founder of Employment Hero, shares insights on [[navigating_macroeconomic_changes_in_the_tech_industry | weathering economic storms]] and discusses strategies for businesses and entrepreneurs to navigate challenging market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Overview of Current Market Conditions
The market has significantly shifted, with interest rates rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. This causes pension funds to move money from speculative stocks, like technology, back into safer assets such as bonds and high-interest-bearing accounts, where they can secure a 5-7% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. As a result, there is less capital available, making it harder to raise funds, and the quality of companies that can raise capital needs to be much higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

Many in the startup community are currently facing significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>. The market conditions are impacting [[challenges_and_strategies_in_raising_capital_for_startups | fundraising]] for later-stage private companies, leading to layoffs and struggles for many good businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

### Dot-Com Crash vs. Current Downturn
Ben Thompson experienced the dot-com boom and bust cycle in the technology sector while living in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. He notes a significant difference between the dot-com crash and the current economic situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.

The dot-com crash was driven by exuberance and an unproven market where few, if any, dot-com companies were profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>. People speculated, even trading URLs like NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. The crash occurred when people realized the internet might not meet their high expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.

In contrast, the current market shift is driven by macroeconomic forces, not because Software as a Service (SaaS) or technology models are broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. Companies like Atlassian remain excellent businesses with strong models and products, despite their valuations being halved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>. The challenge is the flow of capital out of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.

## Lessons from Ben Thompson's Journey
Ben Thompson emphasizes that he would not do anything differently in his journey, despite facing numerous challenges, including constantly staring bankruptcy in the face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. He views his business as a hobby and finds joy in building things, much like playing with Legos, but on a larger scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Bootstrapping and Financial Tightness
Initially, Ben bootstrapped Employment Hero using profits from his other businesses, Employment Innovations and Power to Motivate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. However, he later realized that a SaaS startup requires a significant amount of capital upfront to cover customer acquisition costs, unlike traditional development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. He had to raise capital through venture debt and later a Series A round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

Ben clarifies that his "darkest hours" involved the risk of winding up the business, not personal bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. One difficult period occurred due to major changes in employment legislation, which caused legal and services businesses to dry up, leaving extremely tight cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. He recounted a moment when the business had only $27,000 with a $50,000 payroll due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

Despite these challenges, his motivation was the belief that "if you don't get through, you don't get anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. He lives by the Winston Churchill quote, "When you're going through hell, keep going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

## Strategies for Startups and SMBs
Ben Thompson emphasizes that the challenges faced by tech startup founders are similar to those experienced by small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. He finds great pleasure in building a business that supports SMBs because they genuinely need help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

### Navigating Current Market Conditions
For companies with limited runway and less-than-ideal unit economics, difficult decisions must be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.

*   **Pivot and Cut Hard:** The best advice is to "cut hard and cut early" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. This may involve laying off people, even close friends, to tighten up operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>.
*   **Be Conservative:** Companies should prepare for the worst, batten down the hatches, and be conservative with their resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.
*   **Focus on Unit Economics:** Employment Hero has obsessed over unit economics since its Series A round, leading to best-in-class metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. This focus is crucial for SaaS businesses. Key metrics include burn multiple, growth rate, gross margin, and return on customer acquisition cost (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>.
*   **Understand Liquidation Preferences:** For young people considering joining a startup, it's important to understand the "waterfall on liquidation preferences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. High headline valuations might not mean much if investors have preferences that return their money first upon liquidation, potentially leaving nothing for employees with equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>.
*   **Accept Volatility:** Joining a startup means being "in business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>. Founders and employees with ESOP (Employee Share Option Plan) must be prepared for both ups and downs, including potential "down rounds" (valuation decreases), without feeling like it's a "waste of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.

:::info Optimistic Outlook
While a recession may be looming, Ben Thompson notes that recessions typically lead to interest rate reductions, creating counter-cyclical forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. He also suggests that Australia might avoid a recession, as it has done multiple times before, supported by factors like the Asian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. This indicates that the current downturn might not be as severe as some predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>.

### Advice for Young Entrepreneurs and Professionals
For young people considering [[entrepreneurship_and_risk_management_strategies | entrepreneurship]] or joining startups:

*   **Conviction and Passion:** Only chase an idea if it's fundamentally valuable, based on "first principles," and you are truly passionate about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. Passion is essential to get through tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.
*   **Building Experience:** If a startup doesn't succeed, it still provides valuable "scar tissue" and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.
*   **Evaluate Company Metrics:** Before joining a startup, ask about their unit economics, including burn multiple, growth rate, and gross margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>. It's advisable to join companies in the "excellent" bracket of SaaS metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.
*   **Commitment:** Be prepared to stay through hard times. Those who "flee" when the market turns down are not the ones who will support the company through challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.
*   **Rewarding Challenges:** [[navigating_and_preparing_for_business_crises | Fighting back when behind]] and overcoming challenges can be the most rewarding times in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>.

Adam Poetk, CEO of Deloitte's Australian division, emphasizes a philosophy of [[Life and career adaptability | adaptability]] and continuous learning rather than rigid long-term planning for professional and personal success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:04">[03:04:04]</a>. His own career path, from a "knock about lad" to CEO, exemplifies this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:04">[03:46:04]</a>.

## Unplanned Success and Early Life Influence
Poetk, who describes himself as the "most surprised" to have ended up in his current role, never had a detailed career plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:04">[04:44:04]</a>. His upbringing in the working-class northern suburbs of Melbourne, where he was seen as a "larrikin" and "ratbag" at university, did not suggest a trajectory to CEO of a major professional services firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:04">[02:26:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:04">[03:24:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:04">[05:50:04]</a>. His parents, an engineer and a nurse, provided the freedom to explore and encouraged curiosity without specific expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:04">[03:51:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:04">[04:02:04]</a>. This early foundation contributed to his [[impact_of_early_life_challenges_on_career_drive | career drive]] and willingness to embrace new opportunities.

## Career Decision-Making: Beyond the Plan
Poetk advises against limiting oneself with a rigid plan, especially for young graduates entering the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:04">[07:46:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:04">[09:02:04]</a>. Instead, he advocates for a mindset focused on continuous [[personal_growth_and_work_life_balance | Personal Growth and Work Life Balance]] and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:04">[07:52:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:04">[04:49:04]</a>:

> "My counsel would be don't limit yourself because a plan limits you. Give yourself an opportunity for two or three years to grow to learn so the way I always did, hey this is interesting, if it's boring I stopped doing it if it was interesting and challenged me I kept learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:04">[07:44:04]</a>

Key aspects of his approach to [[career_decision_making | career decision making]] include:
*   **Embracing Opportunities**: Taking every opportunity, even if it means stepping out of one's comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:04">[08:02:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:04">[08:06:04]</a>. A pivotal moment for him was taking a risk by moving to the US for two years with a 13-month-old child, which completely changed his perspective and was crucial to his career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:04">[08:34:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:04">[08:44:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:04">[08:52:04]</a>. This highlights a focus on [[balancing_career_goals_with_personal_life_and_family | balancing career goals with personal life and family]].
*   **Continuous Learning**: Learning from every experience, especially from failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:04">[09:46:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:04">[09:51:04]</a>. He believes that those who succeed the most have also failed the most, but crucially, they learn from those experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:04">[09:54:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:04">[09:57:04]</a>. His commitment to learning led him to pursue an MBA in his mid-20s while raising three children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:04">[10:22:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:04">[10:30:04]</a>, and he continues to learn about topics like climate change, indigenous history, and the future of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:04">[10:44:04]</a>.
*   **Building Networks**: Emphasizing that success in life and career is directly tied to the strength of one's network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:04">[08:16:04]</a>. He built relationships indiscriminately, treating everyone from a car park operator to a CEO with the same respect, highlighting the importance of genuine connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:05:04">[26:05:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:04">[26:07:04]</a>.

## Adaptability within an Organization
Despite spending most of his career at Deloitte, Poetk views it as having had "15 different careers" within one organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:04">[30:44:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:04">[32:26:04]</a>. He believes that changing what you do every few years is more important than changing organizations frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:04">[33:32:04]</a>.

### Key Learnings:
*   **Avoid Stagnation**: If one starts to feel stagnant or stops growing, it's a warning sign to seek something different within the existing environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:04">[31:42:04]</a>.
*   **Leverage Networks**: Staying within an organization allows one's network to compound over years, providing invaluable support and access to skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:55:04">[31:55:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:58:04">[33:58:04]</a>. Changing jobs too frequently can set one back as networks need to be rebuilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:59:04">[31:59:04]</a>.
*   **Life Happens**: Plans often get disrupted by unexpected events, such as a global pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:04">[35:04:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:16:04">[35:16:04]</a>. The ability to adapt to these unforeseen circumstances is the number one characteristic for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:09:04">[35:09:04]</a>.

## Advice for Young People
For those at the beginning of their careers, Poetk offers the following [[advice_for_young_people_and_career_choices | advice for young people and career choices]]:
*   **Take Opportunities**: Even seemingly boring roles can be a source of learning if approached with curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:16:04">[25:16:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:41:04">[25:41:04]</a>.
*   **Build Networks Authentically**: Treat everyone as important and cultivate relationships without expecting immediate returns. The "give to get" mentality ensures long-term support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:35:04">[26:35:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:04">[27:01:04]</a>. Genuine interest in others, rather than their role, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:16:04">[28:16:04]</a>.
*   **Be Adaptable**: Life will inevitably deviate from any rigid plan. The capacity to adjust and embrace new situations is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:04">[35:04:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:26:04">[35:26:04]</a>.
*   **Be Yourself**: Ultimately, the best path is to be authentic and craft one's own journey, learning and adapting along the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:13:04">[42:13:04]</a>.

Poetk's perspective suggests that success is not a linear climb but rather an ongoing process of learning, adapting, and building meaningful connections, allowing for a dynamic and fulfilling career within the context of [[balancing_career_and_family_in_modern_society | balancing career and family in modern society]] and life.

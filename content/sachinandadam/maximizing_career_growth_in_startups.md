Nikki Scevak, co-founder of Blackbird Ventures and Startmate, offers profound insights into optimizing career growth, particularly for young individuals navigating the startup ecosystem. His philosophy emphasizes prioritizing learning and taking calculated risks over traditional career paths.

## Prioritizing the Rate of Learning

Scevak advises that the most crucial factor for career acceleration is to prioritize the "rate of learning" above all else, especially early in one's career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. This means seeking environments that offer rapid knowledge acquisition rather than highly structured, slower-paced learning environments like traditional graduate jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. He suggests that while graduate programs offer learning, they often require "unlearning" later for ambitious achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

Instead of focusing on salary, young professionals should leverage their "personal burn rate" being at its lowest — without the financial commitments of childcare or mortgages — to take career risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

> "The gift that you've been given at 23 is that you haven't ramped up your burn rate. You don't pay childcare or mortgage... now is the time to take that risk." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>

### Founding vs. Joining a Startup

Scevak differentiates between founding a company and joining a scaling startup as environments for [[Learning and career development in startup environments | learning and career development in startup environments]]:
*   **Founding a company** provides immense learning, covering all aspects of creating a business in a "turbo-filled knowledge journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. However, it's a process of discovery, and the rate of learning can be limited if the product or problem isn't valued by customers and the startup fails to gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   **Joining a scaling startup** offers an even higher rate of learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. This is because the company is actively growing and adapting to market demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

## Benefits of Joining a Scaling Startup

Joining a scaling startup, particularly one that has raised a Series A round (e.g., $10M-$20M) and has between 20 to 50 employees, is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

Key benefits include:
*   **Rapid Exposure and Learning:** The rapid growth "slaps you in the face" with knowledge about the market, customers, sales, marketing, and internal organizational dynamics, including processes and communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Career Progression:** As a company scales from, for example, 20 to 200 employees, 180 new roles are created in a short time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. If you build trust and demonstrate your talents early, you can be "super promoted" into these senior positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This means a 27-year-old can achieve a senior vice president role, as seen at Google, without needing 20 years of experience at "boring companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
*   **Lower True Risk:** Despite perceived risk, if a startup fails, the individual gains invaluable [[Learning and career development in startup environments | learning and career development in startup environments]] and a strong network, making them highly attractive for future employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

### Identifying Ideal Scaling Startups
When seeking a scaling startup, Scevak suggests looking for companies that are "post-traction" rather than "pre-traction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. He recommends checking out Blackbird's portfolio companies in Australia and New Zealand that fit this description:
*   **Eucalyptus (Sydney):** Over 200 employees, grew from under 40 in 12-18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>.
*   **Dovetail (Sydney):** Approximately 60 employees, rapidly expanding after raising capital and is a "talent magnet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
*   **Linktree (Melbourne):** Experiencing pure customer scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.
*   **Zeller (Melbourne):** Experiencing pure customer scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.

He emphasizes that the ideal size range for joining a scaling startup is generally between 20 to 200 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. For companies under 20 employees, it might be more restricted to technical product roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

## Investing in Community and Brand

Blackbird Ventures' strategy for success, which can also be applied to individual career growth, centers on community and brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. They believe the "magic of Silicon Valley" comes from successful founders investing in and helping the next generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. Similarly, individuals can maximize their career by contributing to and nurturing communities.

Helping others with their careers creates a powerful "flywheel" effect, as seen with Startmate Fellowship, leading to future opportunities and connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>. This approach helps in calibrating which startups are "good" to join, what stage to join at, and what roles to pursue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. The ultimate goal is to meet the next generation of founders, as many early career professionals in fast-growing startups will become those founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.

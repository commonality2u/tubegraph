The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant and "very gendered impact" globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. While the majority of those dying from COVID-19 are men, the pandemic has disproportionately affected women in several key areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

## Exacerbation of Existing Issues

Prior to the pandemic, there was already a global backlash on human rights, particularly concerning women's and LGBTQI+ rights, often seen as progressive Western values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. This included a specific pushback on women's reproductive rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. The pandemic has further intensified these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

## Key Gendered Impacts During COVID-19

### Domestic and Family Violence
There has been a significant increase in domestic and family violence during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. For example, in Hubei Province (Wuhan), police reported a 300% uplift in women experiencing domestic and family violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. This is particularly concerning given that, prior to the pandemic, nearly a billion women (980 million) were already living in or had recently been in intimate relationships characterized by physical violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. The quarantine and lockdown provisions have exacerbated this problem, making home the "least safe place on the planet" for many women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

### Unpaid Care Work
Unpaid work, including caring for children and elderly parents, is largely the domain of women in nearly every nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. With children out of childcare and school, and more people living at home, the burden of this unpaid care work has disproportionately fallen on women during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

### Employment and Economic Vulnerability
More women have lost their jobs than men during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. This is because women are more often in precarious or casual employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. Women of color, Indigenous women, and other marginalized women experience even higher rates of job loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

### Reproductive Rights
Women's reproductive rights have become a battleground during COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. As of May 2020, 11 states in the US had declared abortion a non-essential or elective procedure, making it unavailable to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. This particularly disadvantages poor women, who cannot travel to other states where such rights are still respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

### Post-Pandemic Recovery
Concerns exist regarding the post-pandemic recovery phase. Most new projects and jobs are expected to come from "shovel-ready" infrastructure projects, which will disproportionately disadvantage women as there are fewer women in construction and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. A balanced recovery needs to include jobs in caring professions such as nursing and public health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

## Global Context
The pandemic has highlighted differing challenges for women in non-Western nations. For example, in some countries, women employed in the informal economy (e.g., street vendors) lost their income due to lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. Efforts by some to become digital entrepreneurs were met with severe backlash, with women being jailed for "damaging the morality of the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

The rise of fundamentalist religions and extremism is a leading cause of backlash against women's and LGBTQI+ rights globally, pushing for traditional gender roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

While COVID-19 presents new challenges, the global efforts towards [[gender_equality_in_australia_and_globally | gender equality]] continue, recognizing that men and women must collaborate to create a more equitable world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of [[Remote work and its impact on company culture and productivity | flexible work]] arrangements, which can allow men more opportunity to engage in caring roles for their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

[[alex_honnolds_involvement_with_regen_ventures | Alex Honnold]], known as one of the world's best climbers and featured in the movie *Free Solo*, has expanded his focus beyond extreme sports to become an advisor in the climate sector for the Australian VC firm, [[alex_honnolds_involvement_with_regen_ventures | Regen Ventures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Early Connections to Environmentalism

Honnold's engagement with environmental causes stems from a natural overlap between rock climbing and caring for the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. His appreciation for nature, derived from constant outdoor exposure through climbing, led to his work with the Honnold Foundation, which supports solar projects globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. His personal interest and extensive reading of environmental non-fiction also contributed to his curiosity in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Involvement with Regen Ventures

As an advisor to [[alex_honnolds_involvement_with_regen_ventures | Regen Ventures]], Honnold is drawn to the company's focus on "regeneration," finding it inspiring to support initiatives that actively improve the world rather than solely focusing on profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. He believes that, ideally, every company should be regenerative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. While he doesn't claim to "advise anything in particular," he sees natural lessons from climbing that apply to tackling significant challenges, managing risk, and thorough preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Key Climate Thematics

Honnold's personal passion lies in solar energy and the broader energy transition to renewables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. However, he appreciates the diverse passions of founders in the climate space, learning about various niche areas like seagrass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. He acknowledges the importance of [[climate_change_and_storytelling | storytelling]] in communicating complex technical solutions to a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Lessons from the Extreme Sports World

Honnold's career as a climber, dedicating 29 years to mastering his craft, offers transferable lessons to any field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. A common misconception about him is that he feels no fear during climbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. In reality, his perceived fearlessness comes from extensive training, practice, preparation, and careful project selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

He emphasizes that with enough preparation, one can reach a point of 100% confidence, making the task no longer scary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This idea translates to business and life: more preparation leads to better outcomes, even when facing risk and fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Advice for Young Founders in Climate

For young Australian founders interested in the climate sector, Honnold's [[advice_for_young_entrepreneurs_in_the_climate_sector | advice is simple]]: "just do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. He encourages acting on good ideas, noting that even if a venture fails, valuable lessons are learned for future attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. He believes the "worst thing is to not start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. He suggests that while failure isn't celebrated, it's accepted as part of the process, especially when considering one's legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Future Focus

Honnold sees his current climate participation, through the Honnold Foundation and his advisory role with [[alex_honnolds_involvement_with_regen_ventures | Regen Ventures]], as sufficient to "fill his cup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. His primary focus remains on his climbing career and challenging himself, alongside his family commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

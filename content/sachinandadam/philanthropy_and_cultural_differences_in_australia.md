Australia's philanthropic landscape presents a unique "puzzle," as described by Daniel Petr, the "grandfather of VC in Australia" and former head of Microsoft Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Despite the country's economic standing, Australia is not a very philanthropic nation when measured at a GDP level, performing "well under Canada, US, UK, and New Zealand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the culture observed in the United States.

## Cultural Disparities and Wealth Allocation

Daniel Petr recounts experiences in the US where dinner conversations among Microsoft colleagues revolved around philanthropy, a stark contrast to typical discussions about house prices in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

Several factors contribute to this [[comparing_the_startup_ecosystems_and_cultural_differences_between_australia_and_the_usa | cultural difference]]:
*   **Historical Influences in the US:**
    *   **Religious tithing** served as a motivator for giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
    *   **Early industrialists** like Andrew Carnegie committed significant funds to philanthropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Carnegie's "Gospel of Wealth" (1865) argued that if the wealthy do not contribute to society, it will "fracture" and lead to unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. He famously stated that "a man who dies rich, dies... a bad human" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
*   **Structural Issues in Australia:**
    *   **Removal of Estate Taxes:** A major factor was the removal of estate taxes in the 1970s, which occurred as a "knee-jerk reaction" to a corrupt Queensland Premier rather than through economic analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. This means Australia has no estate taxes and "no culture of giving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
    *   **Wealth vs. Philanthropy Growth:** As wealth has grown in Australia, philanthropy has "not grown that much," lagging significantly behind the rate of wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

> "I've met hundreds of real wealthy people and many of them are good humans... but they just don't give any money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

Despite Australia's self-perception as a more [[gender_equality_in_australia_and_globally | egalitarian society]] where everyone gets a "fair go" and you can mingle at the beach regardless of wealth, Daniel Petr questions the depth of this egalitarianism beyond surface-level interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

### Holding the Wealthy Accountable

Daniel Petr advocates for holding the wealthiest and most powerful Australians to account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

> [!note] Call to Action for Billionaires
> "If you're a billionaire and you're not giving a substantial part of your money to whatever causes you want, then you should be called out. It's as simple as that. Nobody should be sitting on a billion dollars of cash or assets and not thinking for a moment about helping allocate some of that to people who are suffering or lacking opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

He highlights the disparity in public perception, questioning why someone like Gina Rinehart, who inherited mineral tenements and benefited from commodity price increases, is celebrated as "business person of the year" by the AFR, while founders like Mel Perkins (Canva) and Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes (Atlassian), who built companies from scratch and have pledged significant portions of their wealth, receive less media celebration for their philanthropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Cliff Obrecht from Canva famously stated, "nobody needs a billion dollars," a "shocking statement" that Petr fully agrees with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

### Counterarguments to Philanthropy

Some wealthy individuals argue they are better capital allocators than charities and prefer to wait until they have more time to personally manage their philanthropic efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. While Bill Gates, a role model for Petr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>, pivoted to philanthropy in his late 40s/early 50s and invests "enormous time" in the Gates Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, Petr views this argument as an "excuse mechanism" for most others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

He points out that:
*   Not every executive has the "intellectual capacity" to solve world problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   Many are not prepared to dedicate the time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   It shouldn't be binary; giving smaller amounts (e.g., $10 million or $1 million to 10 charities) can save lives while waiting to become a "perfect philanthropic guru" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
*   Billionaires can "screw up the not-for-profit space" by entering it thinking "everyone else is stupid" when many charities are "better allocators of capital" due to operating on thinner margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. What charities truly need is more resources and help, not micromanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
*   There are services like Charity Navigator that help identify effective charities, eliminating the need for extensive personal analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   Not giving money away has real consequences, leading to suffering or lack of opportunity that "shouldn't be going on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## Vision for Australian Society and Philanthropy

If Daniel Petr were in charge of all philanthropic funds in Australia, his vision would involve a multi-faceted approach to create a fairer and more equal society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

His proposals include:
1.  **Tax System Reform:** Rich people should pay more tax, as Australia is a "low tax nation" compared to OECD tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This money should fund social services, improving access to education and health for those without economic or social backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
2.  **Support for Women in the Workforce:** A "way better job of helping females get back into the workforce" is needed, along with structural changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
3.  **Charity Accountability and Innovation:**
    *   All charities with charity status should be "forced to report their metrics" on how money is spent and if they are efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Failure to report should result in loss of status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
    *   This would lead to consolidation, as smaller charities not delivering outcomes would feed into larger pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
    *   However, he warns against giving all funds to "the big guys" in the charity sector, mirroring the lack of [[innovation_in_australian_technology | innovation in Australian technology]] among large businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
    *   There should be a "capital stack" that includes venture capital for social initiatives, funding "new things that are innovative" even if they carry a risk of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
    *   His own initiative, Start Giving, which allocates $800,000 annually, aims to grow overall philanthropy, with an expectation of proving its value to continue its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

Petr emphasizes that the market cannot solve every societal problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Life is about "shades of grey" and "no one answer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. A stable society requires continuous [[australias_role_and_culture_in_technological_innovation | innovation and creation of global companies]] that pay taxes and offer high-wage jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. The key is to measure progress against goals and be honest about performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

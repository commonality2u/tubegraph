Liam Milwood, CEO of Instant, emphasizes a unique approach to [[developing_a_company_culture_during_rapid_growth | company culture]] and [[building_effective_team_dynamics_and_leadership | team dynamics]] that prioritizes speed, urgency, and an unwavering focus on revenue growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. At 17, Milwood started Instant, which has grown to a $100 million company managing a team of 70 and expanding globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: Momentum and Revenue Obsession

Instant's core values are "revenue obsession and speed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. Milwood believes that "momentum solves every issue in every company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, energizing the team, investors, and customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This focus helps the company move very quickly and avoid the pitfalls of slowing down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

> [!quote] The Importance of Momentum
> "Momentum solves every issue... You can invest so much in culture, you can invest so much in product whereas you know the only thing that truly matters is momentum." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>

The company aims to be the "best, fastest growing company in Australia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, consistently striving for 25% month-on-month revenue growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Goal Setting and Execution

Instant adopts a singular North Star goal for the entire business, typically a revenue target for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This contrasts with having "a million OKRs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. When aiming for $1 million in revenue with eight people, "every single day we spoke about a million dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>, even gamifying it as "million dollars to hoola" with the promise of a team trip to Hawaii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

Goals are broken down into weekly sprints, ensuring everyone, from engineers to salespeople, is clear on their weekly objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. This rapid cadence ensures continuous progress, as Milwood believes that if you give someone two weeks to do something, they will take two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. While targets are ambitious, they are adjusted throughout the quarter to ensure people feel a sense of fulfillment and don't become demotivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

> [!info] Key Focus Areas for Momentum
> *   **One Northstar Goal:** Instead of multiple objectives, the entire company aligns around a single, clear, revenue-driven goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
> *   **Weekly Sprints:** All hands meetings are held weekly, and tasks are broken down into weekly sprints to maintain urgency and consistent prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
> *   **Obsession:** Individuals are encouraged to be obsessed about their particular area of focus (e.g., revenue targets for Australia for a sales lead) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

## [[Identifying and Hiring Talent in Startups | Talent Acquisition]] and [[building_effective_team_dynamics_and_leadership | Team Structure]]

Instant's hiring strategy focuses on identifying individuals with specific traits that align with their fast-paced culture. They prioritize:
*   **Speed and Urgency:** They hire people with enough experience and know-how, but who "still had the energy to move quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   **Communication:** Strong communication skills are highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.
*   **Competitiveness:** Particularly for sales roles, a very competitive drive is sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.
*   **Independence and Confidence:** Engineers are expected to work independently, have a strong voice, and be confident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>.
*   **A-Players:** A stated perk on their website is "you work with A players," recognizing that top talent wants to collaborate with other top talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

Underperformers are removed quickly, as there isn't time for extensive development at their stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. The leadership believes in empowering individuals to make decisions quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a> and trusting them to achieve their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

## [[Execution and leadership in startups | Leadership Style]] and Communication

Milwood describes his leadership style as having an "intensity" and "drive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, stemming from a desire to "prove people wrong" (investors, competitors, disloyal hires) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> and "prove people right" (parents, early employees, investors, customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

As a leader, Milwood has learned to be much clearer in communicating goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a> and to foster a very positive culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. This isn't a "rainbow fairy floss culture" with random perks, but one where leaders are positive, direction is clear, and team members feel supported and are growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. Even during challenging times, maintaining positivity is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

Milwood avoids one-on-one meetings and brainstorming sessions where decisions could be made quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>, preferring to empower people to "just make a decision and just run with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.

## Operational Efficiency and Support

To maintain speed, Instant made strategic decisions to centralize operational support for various teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>. This includes:
*   **Centralized Operations Team:** This team handles tasks that typically consume valuable time for salespersons (e.g., finding contacts, updating CRM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a> and marketers (e.g., website updates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>. The goal is to strip away anything that is not the core job function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>.
*   **In-house Recruiters:** Hiring recruiters early on ensures a consistent pipeline of qualified talent, allowing leaders to focus on interviewing rather than sourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>.
*   **Early Executive Assistant Hire:** Hiring an EA as the eighth employee was initially controversial but proved to be a "huge unlock" by saving leadership time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>.

## Impact of Physical Presence on Culture

Being in person, especially in the early stages, was "huge" for Instant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>. It reduced the need for excessive communication, allowed for ideas to be overheard and problems to be solved informally, and contributed to a positive work environment where people felt happy and less depressed than if working from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>. Milwood acknowledges the importance of flexibility but emphasizes that "culture is just, you know, so powerful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.

## Navigating Challenges and Growth

Milwood openly discusses the psychological challenges of startup growth, particularly the difficulty of maintaining high growth percentages as the company scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. Key strategies for managing internal psychology include:
*   **Strong Co-founder Alignment:** Milwood highlights the importance of his co-founder, Will, and COO, Brandon, being "very on the same page" with "no conflict" and "very aligned as founders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. This removes unnecessary worry and distraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.
*   **Supportive Investors:** Having investors who guide them along the way is also beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.
*   **Product-Market Fit:** Building a product that customers don't churn from and that provides real impact is a huge advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
*   **Personal Wellbeing:** Exercise (running, swimming) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a> and having positive people around, including family who provide reality checks, are crucial for voicing doubts and staying grounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. The excitement of [[building_company_culture_and_founder_mindset | building something]] often "knocks out the stress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.

## Global Expansion and Cultural Nuances

When expanding to the US, Instant initially treated it like Australia, leading to early struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. The key learning was to approach it as "starting a whole another business" with a new culture to build and brand reputation to establish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. This meant building foundations like working with local influencers and attending events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.

A critical decision was to avoid distracting each regional team with the other, ensuring Australian teams focus on Australia and US teams on the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>. This "hyperfocus" is essential for speed and clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>.

Milwood observes that US startups generally "move incredibly quickly" with a pervasive "level of urgency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. Talent there is often more competitive and accustomed to the intense startup environment, leading to a higher caliber of A-players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. While some Australian startups move to the US early, Milwood believes building a strong foundation in Australia first, then using that growth to fund US expansion, was the right approach for Instant, avoiding "unnecessary pressure or stress to the company's early journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>.

Securing venture capital (VC) is a transformative but arduous process for startups, requiring founders to meticulously articulate their vision and demonstrate resilience. For Farouk Ismail, co-founder of Slice (formerly PayatTravel), the journey involved years of bootstrapping before ultimately raising a significant seed round.

## The Journey to Venture Capital: Bootstrapping and Initial Challenges

Initially, Slice (then PayatTravel) was built with internal funds and personal sacrifice. Farouk and his co-founder, Yanik, started the business in 2018 while working at CBA, identifying a market problem where customers used debt for travel [02:24:00]. They aimed to offer a layby service for flights, allowing customers to secure prices and pay weekly or fortnightly before travel, providing an alternative to credit cards and personal loans [03:04:00].

They adopted a "half-in, half-out" approach, starting the business on the side to test the waters and build conviction [04:25:00]. Their Minimal Viable Product (MVP) was a simple WordPress landing page where customers submitted inquiries, which were then manually quoted by a hired assistant, with Farouk personally processing bookings over the phone [04:45:00]. This low-tech approach validated customer demand and built high conviction in the product [05:20:00].

With growing conviction, Farouk decided to "take the leap," quitting his well-paying job at CBA to pay himself $400 a week (around $20,000 a year) [05:51:00]. Six months later, Yanik also quit his job to join full-time [06:16:00].

### Funding Through Personal Means
To fund operations, including marketing and purchasing tickets, Farouk and Yanik pooled their savings [11:22:00]. They also personally took out credit cards to cover expenses, a decision driven by their high conviction in the business metrics, such as customer acquisition cost and payback period [11:34:00]. They consistently maxed out their personal financial capacity, including using all their savings [12:02:00]. Farouk later sold his car, and Yanik refinanced his house to inject more capital into the business [15:52:00].

They also secured loans from friends and family, paying interest on them, which added stress due to the personal guarantees attached [12:33:00]. Bank debt facilities were not an option at that early stage [12:45:00]. For the first four years, they were personally at risk of bankruptcy [13:08:00]. Early attempts to [[challenges_and_strategies_in_raising_capital_for_startups | raise capital]] were met with rejections, with potential investors dismissing their WordPress website as "cute" [13:18:00].

## Navigating Adversity: The COVID-19 Crisis
The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the business, with 95% of its revenue evaporating overnight due to Australia's border shutdowns [13:35:00]. Initially, the focus was on customer care, ensuring refunds or credits for clients who had paid significant amounts, to protect the brand's reputation [14:04:00].

Surviving on government support like JobKeeper, the founders considered one of them getting a job to keep the business afloat [14:32:00]. Instead, they made a "conscious decision" to explore an expansion, noting that despite a 60% drop, the U.S. travel market was still significantly larger than Australia's [15:04:00]. They decided to launch in the U.S., a decision that took four weeks to execute and led to them returning to pre-COVID numbers within three months [15:32:00]. This bold move, funded by personal asset sales, was seen as "going down swinging" [16:05:00].

### Lessons from Crisis: Preparation and Focus
Farouk advises founders to prepare for crises before they happen, much like preparing for war during peacetime [17:26:00]. His personal preparation involved reading books about extreme hardships, such as Viktor Frankl's "Man's Search for Meaning" and Ernest Shackleton's "Endurance," which taught him the human capacity for resilience [17:53:00]. He also drew on Stoic philosophy, particularly the principle of focusing on what one can control [18:55:00].

## The Decision to Seek External Funding
Despite being profitable and self-sustaining, Farouk decided to pursue external funding to [[venture_capital_strategies_and_deal_winning | play the game at a high level]] and build a "massive company" [33:57:00]. This move meant shifting away from a purely profitable, bootstrapped model to one focused on high-growth venture scale [33:57:00].

## The Process of Raising a Seed Round
Raising capital is a challenging process, described as "putting your baby out there" for judgment [30:25:00]. Farouk had to significantly upskill in packaging and presenting the business to investors, articulating its vision, mission, and compelling story [30:36:00]. He spoke to 40-50 investors to secure a few "yeses," eventually partnering with Peak 15 [30:53:00].

One hurdle was being confused with "Buy Now, Pay Later" (BNPL) companies due to their product name, PayatTravel [31:12:00]. However, finding the right investor, like Peak 15, was crucial. Peak 15, introduced by Sach, resonated with their story, understood FinTech deeply, and recognized their mission to impact customers [31:31:00]. Their professionalism and incisive questions, mirroring internal management concerns, distinguished them [32:13:00].

A key learning was the importance of creating optionality [33:04:00]. By building a business with global potential (operating in both Australia and the U.S.), they expanded their investor landscape beyond Australian VCs, providing leverage by not *needing* to raise [33:14:00].

## Qualities Investors Look For in Founders
From an investor's perspective, like Peak 15's, key factors for [[venture_capital_perspectives_and_founderfirst_investing | founder-first investing]] and conviction include:
*   **Ability to handle adversity**: Investors seek founders who have navigated tough times and emerged stronger, as business growth is rarely a "rosy road" [34:49:00]. Surviving COVID-19, which destroyed 95% of their business, was a significant "green flag" [35:00:00].
*   **Strong co-founder relationship**: A complementary partnership that strengthens under pressure is highly valued [35:17:00].
*   **Resilience and ability to "suffer well"**: The understanding that crises will continue to happen makes founders who can suffer and come out stronger highly desirable [35:45:00].

## Evolving Risk Management with Capital
Securing significant capital transforms a founder's approach to risk. Farouk's personal philosophy on risk involves embracing it, viewing it as tied to reward if done smartly [25:08:00]. He distinguishes between foolish risk (e.g., casino bets) and smart risk (e.g., market expansion based on understanding upside and controllable downside) [25:17:00].

As the business scales, the balance between "risk-on" (upside creation) and "risk-off" (downside protection) evolves [36:46:00].
*   **Early stages (bootstrapped)**: 95% risk-on, 5% downside protection [36:50:00]. This reflects a "regret minimization" mindset, where the risk of not pursuing an opportunity outweighed losing savings [21:03:00].
*   **Mature product (PayatTravel)**: Approximately 70% upside creation, 30% downside protection [42:37:00]. There are more responsibilities and thousands of customers to manage [37:04:00].
*   **New product/market expansion (Slice Pay)**: Referred to as "pirate mode," this is 90% upside creation, 10% downside protection [42:52:00]. This allows for aggressive, fast-paced exploration without the "mothership" slowing down new ventures [23:18:00].

Farouk emphasizes the importance of continuing to "take bets" as an entrepreneur; otherwise, the business isn't growing [27:10:00].

## Philosophies on Risk and Funding
Farouk advocates for a long-term view of risk, analyzing it from multiple perspectives and time horizons [21:37:00]. This includes considering the "risk of omission" (what if you don't pursue the opportunity?) versus the "risk of commission" (the direct financial loss) [21:30:00].

For founders, an "all-in" mentality can increase the chance of success, as it triggers creativity and resourcefulness [28:14:00]. Not raising capital early forced Farouk to have significant "skin in the game" and "sweat equity," which further deepened his conviction [28:33:00].

Ultimately, the results define the risk-taker: "If it works, you're a genius; if it doesn't work, you're an idiot" [36:32:00]. Success stems from smart, data-driven bets aligned with customer demand [26:51:00].

### Recommended Resources for Founders
For those navigating crises or building companies, Farouk recommends:
*   **Philosophy**: Stoicism (e.g., "The Guide to a Good Life," works by Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, Epictetus), particularly the principle of focusing on what you can control [47:07:00]. Seneca is a personal favorite for his articulate and poetic style [47:28:00].
*   **Hardship Literature**: Books detailing extreme human suffering and resilience, which provide perspective (e.g., Viktor Frankl's "Man's Search for Meaning," Ernest Shackleton's "Endurance") [47:39:00].
*   **Proactive Preparation**: He stresses the importance of training and preparing for challenges when times are good, rather than trying to figure things out during a crisis [48:35:00].

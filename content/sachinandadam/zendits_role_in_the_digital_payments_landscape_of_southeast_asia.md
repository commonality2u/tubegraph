Zendit, a [[building_a_fintech_company_and_understanding_the_future_of_payments | fintech]] company, was founded by Moses Low, an entrepreneur who grew up in Australia before moving to the US and then focusing on Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Zendit was notably the first Indonesian business to go through Y Combinator, a prestigious global accelerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The company recently completed a significant funding round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Zendit's Business Model

Zendit can be likened to the "Stripe of Southeast Asia," primarily focused on [[building_a_fintech_company_and_understanding_the_future_of_payments | enabling digital payments]] in a rapidly growing region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. The company assists businesses with their payments infrastructure, offering three core services:
*   **Accepting Money**: Helping businesses receive payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.
*   **Paying Out Money**: Facilitating the disbursement of funds for payroll, refunds, supplier payments, and other business expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.
*   **Holding Money**: Providing escrow, custodian, and bank accounts as a service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

Beyond these foundational services, Zendit also develops "value-added services" adjacent to payments, including data products, name validators, Know Your Customer (KYC) products, and a [[digital_banking_and_lending_models | lending product]] that leverages insight into customer cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.

## The Southeast Asian Opportunity

Zendit's success is deeply intertwined with the favorable conditions in Southeast Asia, which Moses Low describes as "the right game to play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. Key factors include:
*   **Demographics**: Indonesia, the fourth-largest country on Earth, anchors a region where the average age is less than 30, with 50% of the population under 30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. This represents a massive, young population.
*   **Mobile Penetration**: Mobile phone penetration exceeds 100%, meaning the average person owns more than one phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. Smartphone penetration stands at approximately 80% and is growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.
*   **Digital Adoption**: Internet access is widespread, and many users are "straight to mobile," having bypassed laptops and desktop computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. The region also boasts some of the world's most social cities in terms of daily active users on platforms like Twitter and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
*   **Underdeveloped Infrastructure**: Despite high digital engagement, the existing physical and digital infrastructure is extremely poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. This creates a significant opportunity for digital solutions to fill gaps, following a predictable lifecycle seen in other countries where e-commerce, then infrastructure businesses, and finally [[building_a_fintech_company_and_understanding_the_future_of_payments | fintech]] emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. This scenario aligns with trends observed in the [[emerging_middle_class_in_asia_and_tech_economy | emerging middle class in Asia and the tech economy]].

## Solving Payment Challenges in Indonesia

Zendit's pivot and subsequent success were directly driven by the acute [[challenges_in_the_fintech_and_banking_industry | challenges in the fintech and banking industry]] within Indonesia's payment landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. Moses Low initially attempted to build a peer-to-peer cash transfer app similar to Venmo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>. However, they quickly discovered the immense difficulty of integrating with existing payment companies due to inadequate APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

Problems identified included:
*   **Fragmented Bank Integration**: Businesses had to individually contact each bank to accept payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. There was no single API for comprehensive integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.
*   **Lack of Payout Infrastructure**: No APIs existed for sending money, especially at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.

Recognizing this critical void, Zendit made a strategic pivot. They built their own infrastructure, including an API for disbursing money, after a conversation with friends who were willing to pay for such a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. This marked their shift to an infrastructure play, which provides a stable foundation regardless of which consumer applications ultimately succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

### Distribution Strategy
Once Zendit found product-market fit, their distribution strategy, particularly for consumer-facing aspects, mirrored successful models like Uber and PayPal: giving away money for free to drive viral effects and incentivize referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. This approach encourages behavioral change and sustained usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

## The Future of Payments and Zendit's Vision

Looking ahead, Moses Low believes that cash will remain significant in Southeast Asia for at least another decade, but anticipates a continuous shift from cash to digital cash, whether through bank transfers, e-wallets, or direct merchant payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

Regarding [[the_future_impact_of_blockchain_and_fintech_in_emerging_markets | blockchain and fintech in emerging markets]], particularly crypto, Indonesia currently restricts its use as a currency or medium of exchange, allowing it only as an asset like gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. While Zendit originated from a Bitcoin hackathon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a> and is bullish on crypto in the long term, they have not yet seen demand for crypto payments in Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.

Zendit's long-term vision is to become a comprehensive digital infrastructure business for Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. Just as developed economies rely on digital infrastructure for cloud, email, and CRM, Southeast Asian economies require similar foundational elements for full digitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. While global players might dominate areas like email or cloud, local entities are essential for payments, tax invoicing, accounts payable/receivable, credit risk, and Know Your Customer (KYC) services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

Moses Low aims for Zendit to provide the "back office" infrastructure, analogous to what AWS did for compute, for all future startups and entrepreneurs in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. This focus on "boring" but essential infrastructure is seen as a significant market opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. The goal is to build several billion-dollar companies within these verticals that serve the region's unique needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. This directly contributes to [[enabling_tech_creators_in_asia | enabling tech creators in Asia]].

Beyond business metrics, a personal mission for Moses Low is to foster a "Zendit mafia," inspired by the PayPal Mafia, where early employees go on to build successful, impactful companies that "screw up the world for good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.

Alex Honnold, renowned as one of the world's best climbers and featured in the movie *Free Solo*, offers valuable [[lessons_from_scaling_and_entrepreneurship | insights]] from the extreme sports world that can be applied to business and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. He serves as an advisor to the Australian VC fund Regen Ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Transition to Climate Investing

Honnold's journey into climate investing stems from a natural overlap between rock climbing and caring for the environment, as he spends significant time outdoors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. His general appreciation for nature led to his work through the Honnold Foundation, supporting solar projects globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. He is personally interested, reads environmental non-fiction, and is curious about solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Honnold enjoys meeting founders who are acting on interesting ideas to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

He was drawn to Regen Ventures because of its focus on "regeneration"â€”supporting things that make the world better, rather than being solely about making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. His primary climate focus remains on solar and the energy transition, but he appreciates the passion of founders in various niche areas like seagrass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. His participation in climate projects is currently focused on the Honnold Foundation and Regen Ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Lessons from Climbing for Business and Investment

Honnold suggests that lessons from his 29-year pursuit of being the best climber can translate to any field, including business and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Tackling Big Challenges and Managing Risk
Rock climbing inherently involves [[entrepreneurship_and_risk_management_strategies | managing risk]] and tackling significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### The Role of Preparation
A common misconception about Honnold is that he feels no fear or doesn't care when free soloing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. In reality, he spends his entire life training, practicing, and preparing extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

He emphasizes that with enough preparation, fear can be eliminated because one becomes 100% confident in their ability to perform the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This translates directly to the business world: more preparation leads to better outcomes, even when [[entrepreneurship_and_risk_management_strategies | risk and fear]] are present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Advice for Founders
For young founders, particularly those interested in climate ventures, Honnold's primary piece of [[advice_on_entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | advice]] is "just do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

*   **Act on your ideas**: The worst outcome of acting on a good idea is failure, from which significant [[lessons_from_experiencing_a_startup_failure | learning]] occurs, leading to better future attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Overcoming the fear of failure**: He notes that in American culture, there's more acceptance of trying again after failure, unlike in Australia where it's viewed more negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Ultimately, at the end of life, people remember your successes and contributions, not failed ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **The worst thing is not starting**: If you are young and passionate, try <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

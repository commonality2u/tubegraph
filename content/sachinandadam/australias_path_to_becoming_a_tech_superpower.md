At the core of [[innovation_in_australian_technology | innovation]] lies attitude: being prepared to address a problem differently than how it was done before, rather than assuming traditional methods are always best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. For Australia to succeed in the world of technology, a key factor is [[innovation_in_australian_technology | innovation]] to drive productivity and competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## The Role of Innovation and Attitude

Malcolm Turnbull, former Australian Prime Minister, emphasizes the importance of continually reviewing processes to find better ways of doing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This extends to mundane tasks like making coffee or getting ready for work, reflecting a "growth mindset" and a natural inclination to "tinker and tweak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

The most crucial element for [[innovation_in_australian_technology | innovation]] is attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. It's about being prepared to approach a problem tomorrow differently than today, avoiding the mindset of "we've always done it this way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This open attitude is particularly important for young people who are less constrained by past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Government Initiatives and Investment

During his tenure as Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull's government introduced the National [[innovation_in_australian_technology | Innovation]] and Science Agenda (NISA) in 2015, which included approximately 24 measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Key aspects of NISA included:
*   Tax incentives for investors in startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   Establishment of new [[investing_in_australian_tech_startups | innovation]] funds, such as the medical research fund and Main Sequence Ventures (the CSIRO fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

These initiatives had a significant impact, leading to a substantial increase in venture capital in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. While Australia's economy is smaller than that of [[comparison_of_startup_ecosystems_silicon_valley_vs_australia | Silicon Valley]], David Shaen, who invests in both Australia and Israel, suggests that the Australian startup sector is comparable or even larger than Israel's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Historically, raising capital for tech companies in Australia was challenging, leading companies like [[Australias_First_Unicorn_Comtech | OzEmail]] to go public in the United States in the 1990s due to lack of local funding at sensible valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This situation has since changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## Overcoming Cultural Barriers

A significant weakness, particularly in politics, is risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. There's a reluctance to admit when something isn't working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. In contrast, the tech sector, especially smart entrepreneurs, are prepared to "fail fast" and cut failing projects quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. When NISA was launched, Turnbull explicitly stated that not all measures would succeed, and those that didn't would be discarded, while successful ones would be amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

This cultural shift towards accepting failure as a learning opportunity is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. In places like [[comparison_of_startup_ecosystems_silicon_valley_vs_australia | Silicon Valley]], failure is viewed as an acceptable part of the learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Learning more from failure than from success is a concept reinforced by the term "postmortem" for failures, unlike successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. Investors often value entrepreneurs who have experienced "wipeouts" because they have gained valuable lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

## Government as a Customer and Sovereign Capability

A key step for [[the_future_of_technology_and_innovation_in_australia | Australia's future tech success]] is for government departments to become active supporters and customers of Australian startups and early-stage companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. Governments tend to prefer dealing with large, established companies due to risk aversion and bureaucratic alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. However, startups prefer contracts over grants, as contracts provide validation, experience, and valuable feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

There is insufficient awareness of the importance of encouraging Australian technology, particularly in the defense sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Defense tends to be conservative and often buys foreign equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Malcolm Turnbull emphasizes that Australian sovereignty is deeply linked to the ability to build, design, maintain, and sustain technology domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. This includes ensuring that partnerships with international allies advance Australian technology rather than merely making Australia a customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. An example of Australian world-leading tech is Advanced Navigation, which develops inertial navigation technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>.

## Media's Role and National Perception

[[tech_media_in_australia_and_asia_pacific | The media]] plays a crucial role in shaping the narrative around Australia as a technology nation, rather than solely a mining nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. There is a tendency in Australia not to "talk our own book enough" or even notice the country's technological achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. While the minerals lobby is well-resourced and visible due to its export volume, the importance of the tech sector is often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. Organizations like the Australian Technology Council are working to highlight the sector's job creation and capital deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

## Future Focus Areas

If he were Prime Minister today, Malcolm Turnbull would focus on three key areas:
1.  **[[the_future_of_technology_and_innovation_in_australia | Innovation]] and Industry Support**: Ensuring that Australian technology and industry are actively supported and advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.
2.  **Clean Energy Transition**: Focusing on the transition to clean energy, with Australia having the means to become a zero-emission country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.
3.  **National Unity**: Prioritizing the unity of Australia as a multicultural society, pushing back against divisive forces in politics and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>. Australia is described as the most successful multicultural society globally, with nearly a third of Australians born overseas and over half having at least one foreign-born parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>.

To continue succeeding in technology, beyond capital which is always valuable, Australia needs tangible success stories, like Canva's distributions, to attract more venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. From a governmental perspective, culture is very important, with Turnbull noting that positively and authentically talking about [[innovation_in_australian_technology | innovation]] was one of the most important things he did with NISA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

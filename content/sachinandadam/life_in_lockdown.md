Life in lockdown presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities, as experienced by the hosts of the Satchmo Adam Show during Sydney's lockdown period. The experience is characterized by "ebbs and flows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, with some days offering appreciation for extra time with family and hobbies, while others bring a "lingering feeling of wasting our twenties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Personal Experiences and Adaptations

Sydney has been under a significant lockdown, causing a halt in many aspects of daily life and affecting the ability to record episodes in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Despite the challenges, there's a sense of gratitude for past travel experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

For many, including the hosts, the lockdown has meant a shift in daily routines and priorities:
*   **Time with family** Spending more time with family has been a positive aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Relationships** Being in a relationship makes lockdown "a lot easier to deal with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, as there's someone to be with constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Reduced Stress** One host noted having "a lot less stress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> compared to earlier periods of intense job applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Impact on Young People

There's particular empathy for younger individuals, such as those aged 18-19, who are spending their formative years in lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Some university students have gone through their entire first two years without attending a single class in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, highlighting the unique challenges on [[life_and_career_adaptability | life and career adaptability]].

## Making the Most of Lockdown

Despite the desire for travel and social activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, the hosts consciously decided to "make the most of lockdown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This involved:
*   **Focusing on Work and Projects** Shifting attention to work and key projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Podcast-Related Projects** Engaging in numerous projects related to their podcast and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Personal Hobbies** Incorporating activities like surfing to offset intense work periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Time Perception

The extended lockdown has led to a distorted perception of time, with one host jokingly stating they "thought it was February" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a> despite being well into the latter half of the year. There's a shared sentiment that "almost the best part of two years have been sucked away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a> due to travel restrictions and limited social opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.

## Coping Mechanisms and Wellbeing

### Surfing
A significant positive change during lockdown has been the uptake of surfing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. It's described as an "awesome physical activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a> that combines nature with physical exertion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. Surfing acts as a "counterbalance to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>, helping to feel "fresh and energized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:16">[00:44:16]</a>. It forces presence, akin to meditation and yoga, as one must react to nature rather than making analytical choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. This focus on physical activity and nature helps in [[balancing_work_life_and_personal_wellbeing | balancing work life and personal wellbeing]].

### Vaccine Uptake
There's pride in the high uptake of the AstraZeneca vaccine among 18 to 25-year-olds in Sydney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. Despite initial unclear media coverage and previous recommendations against it for their age group, young people "have really led the charge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a> in understanding the vaccine's importance for overcoming the Delta variant and exiting lockdown earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>. This highlights a collective effort in navigating the [[impact_of_covid19_on_business_strategy | impact of COVID-19 on business strategy]].

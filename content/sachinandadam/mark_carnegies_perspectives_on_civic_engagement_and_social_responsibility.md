Mark Carnegie offers significant [[leadership_insights_and_lessons | insights]] on the importance of civic engagement and societal productivity, emphasizing the obligations that come with privilege and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

## The Importance of Civic Participation
Carnegie believes that living in Australia is an "incredible accident of birth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. He draws upon scientific and cultural progress, asserting that building up society, even by an inch, is far more important than tearing it apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. He expresses concern that the ability to "tear society apart" is more at risk than people understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.

He points to the geopolitical shift during the coronavirus pandemic, where China advanced significantly, while the West was inwardly focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. He is "dumbfounded" by Australia's choice to align with what he considers a "criminal administration in America's history" by provoking a conflict with China, instead of building a coalition with Japan and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.

Carnegie argues that those who are "lucky" – born in Australia and part of the "cognitive elite" – have inherent responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. He advocates for active civic participation from younger generations, viewing it as crucial for society's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. His perspective aligns with an Edmund Burke view of the social contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

### Engaging as Young People
Carnegie suggests that engagement in the crypto space is likely to be "societally productive," contrary to [[Mark Carnegies career in high finance and private equity | Charlie Munger's]] views on crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. He advises young people to embrace new technologies like NFTs and decentralised finance, seeing them as the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.

## Social Responsibility in Business
Carnegie draws on the historical context of companies being granted limited liability and unlimited life through an act of parliament, implying that this conveyance came with an obligation to demonstrate societal productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>. He encourages businesses to consider the "second and third order consequences" of their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.

He differentiates between genuine "societally productive" efforts and "virtue signaling rubbish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. He acknowledges that auditing societal productivity is complex and "not easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>.

## Challenges to Societal Well-being

### Tragedy of the Commons
Carnegie identifies "large-scale tragedy of the commons problems" as a primary reason why capitalism faces issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. He argues that these are failures of government regulation and democracy, not capitalism itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a>. He suggests that a "global carbon tax" would be more effective than other climate change interventions, but democratic processes hinder its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

### Critiques of Climate Advocates
He criticizes certain climate advocates, such as "extinction rebellion people," for their unwillingness to explore direct and impactful interventions like nuclear energy, atmospheric whitening, or oceanic fertilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. He views their stance on these solutions as "absolutely crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

### Affordable Housing
Carnegie attributes problems with affordable housing to "spoiled people" who hold "nimby" (not in my backyard) attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. He argues that regulatory constraints and the desire to protect property prices prevent efficient transportation systems and the construction of more affordable housing, effectively stopping poor people from having better accommodation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>.

### Local vs. Global Impact
He notes a tendency for people in Australia to give money to "door neighbors" to "conscience wash" rather than focusing on areas globally where capital could have the biggest impact on the human condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>. Despite this, he is personally involved in fintech ventures in Zambia, seeing [[social_enterprise_and_fitness | fintech]] and crypto as technologies that will "absolutely change" Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>. This aligns with [[intersection_of_business_and_social_impact | the intersection of business and social impact]].

## Views on Vaccination
Carnegie expresses strong frustration with vaccine hesitancy, deeming it "absolutely mental" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>. He questions why society is willing to accept loss of liberty through lockdowns but not mandate positive interventions like vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>. He states that those unwilling to get vaccinated are "too stupid to understand that actually society did make progress when it invented vaccinations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

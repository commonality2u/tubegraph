Jonathan Zhu, co-founder of Tribe Capital, is a key figure in the application of data science to venture capital. Tribe Capital is described as one of the first data-driven VC funds globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, managing multiple billions of dollars in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Jonathan Zhu's Background and the Rise of Data Science

Jonathan Zhu's diverse background includes a PhD in Physics from Stanford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, experience as a founder, a data scientist, and a partner at Social Capital before co-founding Tribe Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

A connecting thread throughout his career has been data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Zhu was one of the first five data scientists at Facebook in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, an era he refers to as the "big data big bang" (roughly 2008-2010) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. During this period, there was a "Gold Rush" of tech companies hiring PhDs to analyze vast amounts of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The term "data science" emerged from this work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Zhu views physics as the "greatest quantitative model that humans have built" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, and this desire to find models that work in business, product adoption, and human behavior drove his pursuit of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. His decision to pursue data-oriented roles was also motivated by a desire to find "white space" â€“ areas where others weren't operating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. He compares this to the "blue ocean" strategy in business, applying it to personal career paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

Physicists, historically, have been at the forefront of new quantitative fields like computer science and quantitative hedge funds because they are willing to enter areas where there's no existing model or degree program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. They combine structured thinking with quantitative flexibility and are "willing to be quantitatively sloppy" where traditional computer science academics might insist on rigorous proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

### Learnings from Social Capital

At Social Capital, Zhu's objective was to apply the data science insights developed at Facebook to [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | Venture Capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. Facebook had developed sophisticated methods beyond just ad ranking, including using data for corporate development and informing product-level strategic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

Early attempts at Social Capital included scraping internet data to build sourcing models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. However, this was deemed marginal because the existing partners already had extensive networks and saw more than enough companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. The real value came from adapting Facebook's growth frameworks (akin to product-market fit) to other business models like SaaS, payments, and the sharing economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. The goal was to share these models to help entrepreneurs quantify and rethink their businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

Zhu likens their data science approach to accounting, providing a quantitative analytical lens to understand the present and past state of a business, rather than solely predicting the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. Just as Benjamin Graham used accounting to assess value, Tribe Capital uses data to understand product-market fit and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

### Tribe Capital's [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | Data-Driven Approach]]

Tribe Capital's strategy is built on a "data-first" principle. They aim to help 400 founders annually with quantitative benchmarks and feedback, even if they don't invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. This generates goodwill and provides access to interesting companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

Their initial assessment involves a conversation to determine if data work can be done, focusing on companies that already have data, typically in the $1 million to $10 million revenue range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. This stage is distinct from later-stage growth companies (typically $20 million+ revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. In this "middle part," neither team nor data dominates, making it complex and interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

While they conduct data work on about 400 companies and deep dive into 70 annually, they only invest in roughly 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. The majority of their time is spent on the 70 companies considered for investment, where a mixture of qualitative and quantitative analysis occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. This balancing act involves assessing the founder, market, and team alongside data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

Zhu notes that while the data work is crucial for providing value and gaining access, the investment process itself integrates traditional qualitative factors once the initial data insights are established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

### The Concept of Product-Market Fit

Jonathan Zhu views product-market fit as having "gradations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. The key is to quantify and benchmark it against other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. Instead of focusing on time-based financial statements, Zhu emphasizes focusing on customer acquisition milestones (e.g., 10, 100, 1,000 customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. Tribe Capital has developed a systematic approach to unit economics that transfers across all businesses, detailed in a public blog post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>.

### [[Building and managing a venture capital fund | Building Tribe Capital]]

The decision to start Tribe Capital stemmed from the belief that their data-driven approach was the future of investing, and it wouldn't survive if they joined existing traditional firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>. These established firms often rely on strategies that worked in the past and lack the impetus to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>.

Raising their first fund was challenging, requiring around 700 conversations with Limited Partners (LPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>, and was compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>.

Tribe Capital's thesis, while present from the beginning, was more theoretical. They promised to build a giant software system to enable deep data benchmarking and deliver value to founders and LPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.

### [[Key investments and experiences in venture capital | Notable Investments]]

Zhu particularly enjoys investments in overlooked companies, citing Docker as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. Docker, an older company that had a recapitalization, faced bias from investors who had previously lost money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. Tribe's data approach allowed them to see the underlying value separate from the past "baggage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.

## Units of Atomic Value

Zhu's "ShipRocket essay" introduces the concept of "units of atomic value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. This idea evolved from the "engagement" metrics of the Social Web, where captured attention was valued even without direct revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.

Other examples of potential units of value include:
*   The "hour of the gig worker's time" in the gig economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
*   Compute power, as seen in crypto (e.g., Ethereum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>.
*   Personal data, where users currently don't capture its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>.
*   Training data in the AI era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.

The key for investors is to identify the thesis of a new unit of value and then see if people actually use it, proving its real-world value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>. In the case of ShipRocket in India, the atomic unit was transactional information, which, due to the different infrastructure compared to the U.S., allowed ShipRocket to "refactor parts of it and capture a bunch of the value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>.

## Talent Spotting in Venture Capital

In early-stage companies or investment firms, roles are likely to shift frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. Therefore, there's a strong preference for "generalist flexible types" over specialists who excel at only one specific role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. Zhu's personal preference for flexible environments, influenced by his background as a jazz musician (where finding unexplored space is key, unlike classical music's linear progression) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, aligns with this hiring philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

Human Health, co-founded by Georgia Via and Kate Lamberis, emerged from deeply [[personal_experiences_and_goals_in_entrepreneurship | personal experiences]] navigating the healthcare system. Their shared challenges led them to create a startup aiming to address significant issues within health services, attracting the largest pre-seed investment in Australian history for an all-female founder team [00:00:15], [00:00:22], [00:01:07]. This record-breaking AUD $10.15 million round in 2022 underscored the resonance of the problem they sought to solve [00:00:28], [00:09:16].

## Foundational Motivations: A Response to Systemic Failures
The founders observed that many people experience personal struggles with the healthcare system, including misdiagnosis, slow processes, and a lack of new technology and innovation [00:00:54], [00:00:58]. Their own lives provided firsthand evidence of these shortcomings.

### Georgia's Perspective
Georgia's initial "why" for tackling healthcare problems stemmed from personal tragedy. She lost her father to illness approximately two to three months before joining Canva, where she would later meet Kate. This experience brought to light numerous issues within Australia's hospital system [00:03:47], [00:03:56]. Furthermore, her family has a significant history of serious mental illnesses, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and manic depression, which were common themes throughout her childhood and personal experiences [00:04:36], [00:07:27], [00:07:30]. These profound experiences ignited a desire to make a difference, though she initially felt she couldn't tackle such a vast problem alone [00:04:09].

### Kate's Journey
Health has been a consistent backdrop to Kate's life [00:05:03]. She lost her mother to an aggressive form of lung cancer at the age of 16, and her father to Parkinson's a few years later [00:05:07], [00:05:14]. These early experiences with chronic disease were compounded by challenges with her own children's health [00:05:18]. Her daughter began exhibiting developmental delays around 17-18 months old, leading to an autism diagnosis after months of waiting [00:05:23], [00:05:49]. Dissatisfied with the limited options provided, Kate embarked on a journey of self-education and research, ultimately finding solutions that allowed her daughter to lead a normal, mainstream life despite early prognoses from doctors [00:05:57], [00:06:04], [00:06:21].

Later, during the COVID-19 pandemic, her son began to exhibit similar symptoms, which further motivated her. Kate realized that focusing solely on her son at home wouldn't solve the systemic lack of solutions, leading her to seek broader impacts, which Human Health became [00:07:44], [00:07:59].

## The Partnership and Shared Vision
Despite their initial separate [[journey_from_employment_to_entrepreneurship | journeys from employment to entrepreneurship]] and different backgrounds—Kate had been hired by Georgia at Canva [01:42]—their shared experiences with healthcare system failures created a powerful bond. They discovered a profound alignment in their "why," realizing they "couldn't not do this" [00:10:57]. This infectious passion and domain expertise were key factors that inspired world-class talent and investors, including AirTree and Skip Capital, to join their mission [00:10:07], [00:10:40], [00:11:04].

## Shaping the Company's Culture and Purpose
Their [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_mindset | entrepreneurial journey and mindset]] was deeply influenced by these formative experiences, impacting not only the product but also the company culture. They aimed to challenge the stereotype of a "flat out" tech company by fostering a more compassionate environment where employees could bring their whole selves to work [00:12:19], [00:12:30]. This vision, while seemingly "fluffy and soft," proved challenging to implement in practice, particularly in hiring individuals who possessed both exceptional skill and the right aptitude for such a culture [00:12:39], [00:13:01].

Human Health's core purpose is to be a tool for patients and carers, especially those with chronic diagnoses, to track symptoms, treatments, and learn what works for them, empowering them to advocate for their deserved care [00:13:33], [00:14:01]. This design choice directly reflects the founders' own experiences navigating complex health conditions.

## Redefining Success
The founders' personal experiences also profoundly reshaped their definition of [[personal_experiences_and_goals_in_entrepreneurship | entrepreneurial success]]. Instead of chasing a singular, distant point of success, they emphasize the success of each day [00:17:26], [00:17:41].

> "Your life is made up by the days that you live so if you had 10 years forol the company and every day of that 10 years was terrible then you win some award or you like hit some crazy number but what a waste of a lot..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>

They prioritize helping people and solving real problems over making the business a "uniform billion dollar business" or solely pleasing investors [00:18:24], [00:19:35]. The motivation stems from a desire to remove the despair and self-blame that people experience when facing health crises, just as Kate did when her son was diagnosed [00:19:16].

For Georgia and Kate, their life experiences of loss and illness have changed their perspective on what they value. They measure their self-worth not by the size of Human Health, but by *how* they operate within it and the impact they have on others [00:18:43], [00:18:50], [00:19:01]. This deep-seated [[motivation_and_background_of_successful_entrepreneurs | motivation]] ensures their commitment to the mission is far more profound than mere financial gain [00:19:30].

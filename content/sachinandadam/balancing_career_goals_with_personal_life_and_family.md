Sahil Bloom, a content creator and investor known for his Twitter threads, Substack, and podcast, experienced a meteoric rise in 2020 and 2021 [00:00:00]. Despite his professional success, he places a strong emphasis on [[balancing ambition with personal relationships | relationships]], vulnerability, and prioritizing personal life [00:00:16].

## Core Values: People and Relationships

At his core, Sahil Bloom is a "people person" [00:02:40]. His life has always been driven by relationships, both with family and friends, and broader networks [00:02:04]. He finds great energy in being around people, hearing their stories, and interacting with them [00:02:14]. He loves helping people and creating value for those around him [00:02:43].

This intrinsic focus on people was influenced by his upbringing. He comes from a mixed-race background, with his mother growing up in Bangalore, India, and his father being a white Jew from the Bronx [00:03:21]. Their marriage in 1982 was not accepted by either family, leading to family strife and his father's estrangement from his side of the family [00:03:33]. This resulted in Sahil having a deep connection to his Indian heritage and extended family [00:03:51]. This upbringing, including extensive travel and exposure to diverse people and circumstances, gave him a "microcosm of Humans of New York but all over the world" [00:04:19]. He realized that despite differences in background, people share similar motivations, such as wanting to take care of their families and be happy [00:04:52].

## Parental Influence and Life Lessons

Sahil attributes much of his perspective to his parents, stating he owes them "quite literally everything" [00:05:32].

### Lessons from his Father
His father, an academic and professor, was the hardest worker Sahil has ever been around [00:05:54]. Despite not achieving significant financial wealth from his career, he pursued something he was passionate about that created value for the world [00:06:16]. From his father, Sahil learned the "head down grind things out mindset" [00:06:28]. Crucially, his father also "somehow found time to always be there for my sister and I" and coached their little league teams, even when "bone tired" [00:06:33]. Sahil also learned the "power of love" from his father, who sacrificed his family relationships to marry Sahil's mother, a deep love that continues to be a role model for Sahil's own relationship [00:06:46].

### Lessons from his Mother
His mother embodies a spirit of adventure and kindness [00:07:12]. She secretly applied to college in America, came at age 18 with no money, and built an amazing life [00:07:21]. She is an "incredible storyteller" and possesses an "amazing personality," with around 50 people considering her their best friend [00:07:34].

## Navigating Career and Personal Priorities

### Early Career and Rejection
Sahil's early career was marked by challenges [00:09:02]. Despite graduating from Stanford with a bachelor's and master's degree and playing baseball, he struggled to find a job, facing rejections due to lack of internship experience [00:09:30]. This period left him feeling "really lost" [00:10:49].

A similar "dark moment" occurred when he was transitioning from his prior role in private equity [00:11:15]. He initially pursued early-stage investing, driven by what "sounded externally impressive" and what his parents "would be quote unquote proud of," or "the big flex" for LinkedIn [00:11:40]. He faced rejections again, with firms disliking his "public presence" or finding his background not fitting their bucket [00:12:00]. This left him in a "terrible spot" [00:12:28]. However, these "darker moments" always "preceded this amazing clarity and light" [00:13:22].

### Shifting Priorities and Vulnerability
Sahil consciously works on being more vulnerable, a goal he set for himself [00:08:09]. He believes it's his duty to show the "reality of what the journey looks like" [00:08:57]. He reflects on the performative nature of social media, where people often present only their best selves [00:08:35].

His perspective on life's pillars — job, family/friends, relationships, and health — has changed over time [00:32:09]. In his early career, his focus was primarily on making money and achieving arbitrary career milestones like being a VP by 25 or partner by 30 [00:34:31]. However, this changed dramatically around the time of the COVID-19 pandemic [00:34:56]. He observed the shifting world, his parents getting older, and his desire to start a family and be a "huge part of my kids lives" [00:35:01]. He realized that the "trade of working... 90-100 hours a week to make x dollars wasn't a smart trade" [00:35:24].

> "You can't optimize for all of these at all times. You can shift what's your focus at any given time and I think it's a productive exercise to just think about like at any given phase what are your focus areas and almost like overly communicate that to the people around you" [00:32:23]

For Sahil, health has always been a constant priority throughout his life [00:33:04]. He emphasizes the importance of communicating one's priorities to those around them [00:33:20].

### Prioritizing Family and Relocation
A profound shift occurred in May 2021 when he woke up and told his wife he wanted to move back to the East Coast to be closer to his parents [00:36:09]. This was an "unbelievable clarity" moment, leading to them selling their California home, buying a new house in New York, and moving within a month [00:36:31]. This decision was influenced by the realization that with parents getting older, time with them is finite [00:35:48]. This move has been the "best decision" he's ever made, allowing him to see his parents twice a month and prepare to be a much bigger part of his first child's life [00:36:35].

## Staying Grounded
Despite his fast rise to fame as a content creator, Sahil remains grounded [00:37:29]. His family plays a crucial role in this [00:38:31]. His wife "doesn't care a damn about how many followers I have" and prioritizes his presence and relationship with her and their child [00:38:36]. His closest friends, whom he's known since childhood, also keep him grounded and "don't give a s*** that I have a bunch of followers on Twitter" [00:39:07].

He also acknowledges that "haters are sometimes a good thing" because they "keep your head on straight" [00:40:33]. He believes that realizing that admired figures are "not actually that different from any of us" is a liberating feeling [00:41:42]. This cultivates humility, recognizing "there's always someone that's smarter, better, faster" and encourages continuous striving for improvement [00:42:09].

## Advice for Young Professionals (20s)
For young professionals, Sahil's advice centers on identifying whether one is a "builder or a salesman (or saleswoman)" [00:45:16]. He recommends focusing on and enhancing one of these two skills early in one's career [00:46:29]. He believes that if you can either build or sell, you will always have value [00:46:40]. For most people, the answer is "sell" – not just in a sales role, but learning to "sell yourself, sell ideas, sell investments" [00:46:52].

He wouldn't change his past career decisions, as they led him to a place where he is "quite happy" [00:47:32].

His final piece of advice for young leaders:
*   Recognize that "you're young" and "not everything has to be about progress, growth, achieving x on y timeline" [00:51:05].
*   Embrace curiosity [00:51:17].
*   Spend time with "great people" and develop "deep relationships" [00:51:19].
*   Be in rooms where you're "the dumbest one in the room," absorbing, listening, learning, and asking questions [00:52:12].

He believes that if you cultivate an "insatiable curiosity for the world and for life," the rest will take care of itself [00:52:24]. This approach is not just for twenty-somethings but a productive way to live life at any age [00:52:31].

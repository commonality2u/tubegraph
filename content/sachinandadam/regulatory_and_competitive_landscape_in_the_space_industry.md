The space industry is undergoing a significant transformation, marked by a [[the_new_space_race_and_global_satellite_boom | new space race]] and a dramatic increase in satellite deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This modern era differs from the 1960s Space Race, which focused on missions like the Apollo program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. Today's competition involves governments, adversaries, and private entities like Elon Musk, with activities ranging from launching satellites for various purposes to countries spying on each other in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### The Evolving Landscape of Space

The number of objects launched into space remained relatively stationary between 1965 and 2010 but has since risen dramatically, exceeding 2,600 annually by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:45">[01:45:45]</a>. Experts predict a surge from approximately 3,000 active satellites a few years ago to 100,000 within the next seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:10">[02:10:10]</a>. This growth is driven by factors such as cheaper launch costs, making space more accessible, and the entry of commercial companies (like SpaceX) and academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>.

However, this increased activity also presents challenges:
*   **Space Debris:** The rising volume of satellites increases the risk of debris. Incidents have occurred where space debris, such as a battery from the International Space Station or a piece of SpaceX debris, has fallen to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:07">[10:07:07]</a>.
*   **Maintenance and Spying:** The sheer number of objects in orbit necessitates improved monitoring for maintenance and raises concerns about countries engaging in espionage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:05">[04:05:05]</a>.

### Geopolitical Influence on Space

The current [[impact_of_geopolitics_on_space_collaboration | space race]] is an absolute reflection of terrestrial politics transforming the space environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:15">[03:15:15]</a>. Previously, space endeavors, such as the International Space Station, were deeply collaborative, bringing former adversaries like the US and Russia together for joint projects benefiting humankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:21">[03:21:21]</a>. Unfortunately, this collaborative spirit is being displaced by dynamics of competition and a desire for dominance, mirroring global power shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:36">[03:36:36]</a>.

### Heo's Role in Space Surveillance

An Australian startup called Heo plays a critical [[role_of_startups_in_space_surveillance_and_satellite_monitoring | role in space surveillance]] by helping Western allies monitor activities in orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. Founded in 2016 as an asteroid mining company, Heo pivoted two years in when they realized asteroid mining wasn't a huge business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:50">[06:50:50]</a>. They shifted to imaging other satellites, leveraging their existing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:01">[07:01:01]</a>.

Heo manufactures cameras and sensors for satellites, enabling governments and companies to monitor space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. They operate a lab in Botany, Sydney, where they build cameras that have gone into orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. Their mission is to make space transparent by imaging anything in the solar system on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:31">[06:31:31]</a>. They help satellite operators identify issues on their satellites by taking photos from other satellites as they pass nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:41">[06:41:41]</a>.

Heo's unique competitive advantage lies in being both a hardware and a software company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:27">[07:27:27]</a>. They primarily offer subscriptions to their software and the analytics derived from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:36">[07:36:36]</a>. Because there aren't enough sensors in space, they also build and operate their own, or sell them to other companies, to acquire more data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:47">[07:47:47]</a>. Their customers include commercial entities and government agencies like the Australian Space Agency, UK Space Agency, and national security agencies in the US, Japan, Australia, and the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:01">[08:01:01]</a>.

Their software analyzes footage from cameras and sensors, utilizing AI to hunt through data sets, find target satellites, and enhance images before delivering them to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:56">[10:56:56]</a>. They focus on optimizing camera usage (considering imaging distance, velocity, and lighting) and applying post-processing to improve image quality for better decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:44">[12:44:44]</a>.

### Regulatory and Competitive Impact

The sensitive nature of the space industry and its ties to government contracts mean that regulatory changes can significantly impact companies like Heo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:46">[14:46:46]</a>. For example, US monopoly laws previously prevented US companies from entering the specific market Heo operates in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:54">[14:54:54]</a>. Heo's activities in Australia actually triggered a change in this US law approximately 18 months ago, allowing other companies into the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:02">[16:02:02]</a>.

This legislative change opens Heo to increased competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:04">[15:04:04]</a>. However, Heo views this as an opportunity, leveraging their first-mover advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:12">[16:12:12]</a>. They can now partner with US companies that were previously prohibited from this type of work, renting time on their satellites and monetizing their downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:30">[16:30:30]</a>. This strategy allows Heo to onboard sensors that were previously inaccessible to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:42">[16:42:42]</a>.

The company believes space will become a more transparent place in the next five years, with Heo playing a significant role in that transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:56">[16:56:56]</a>. Their technological and business developments are geared towards this future endpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:30">[17:30:30]</a>. The increasing number of companies in Australia playing a role in this expanding industry, like Heo, are contributing impactful things to the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:34">[18:34:34]</a>.

Vu Tran, co-founder of Goan, a multi-billion dollar edtech company, has announced he is founding a defense company focused on rockets and guided weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. This new venture marks a significant [[transitioning_from_edtech_to_defense_industry | transition from edtech to defense industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

## Motivation for Entering the Defense Space

Vu Tran's primary motivation stems from concerns about Australia's "sovereignty and sovereign capability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:23">[00:40:23]</a>.
*   **Dependency on Allies** Australia spends between $50 and $55 billion a year on defense, ranking 13th globally in raw spending and eighth per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. Despite this, Australia has almost no companies in the top 100 global defense companies, meaning it buys most of its technology from overseas, primarily the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>. This dependence means that if the US goes to war, Australia is implicitly involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. Vu Tran's aim is to build up Australia's own capability to allow for independent decision-making, rather than being forced into conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.
*   **Personal Philosophy** As a father of two young children, Vu Tran is driven by the desire to prevent a future where his kids might be forced into military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. He believes that if there's a greater than zero percent chance his two-year-old son might involuntarily hold a gun in the next two decades, he needs to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>. His family's history as Vietnamese refugees, with his father having experienced war his entire life until arriving in Australia, further informs this perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.
*   **Tackling Hard Problems** Vu Tran intentionally chooses to tackle difficult and controversial problems that others might avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>. He views his new company as a "fire extinguisher" – hoping its products are never needed, but essential for preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>.

## Approach to Building a Defense Company

### Changing the Military-Industrial Complex
Vu Tran states that he is "not joining the military industrial complex; I'm trying to change it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. He acknowledges issues with current defense procurement and industry practices, aiming to bring about necessary changes from within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.

### Focus on "Building" and the Early Stage
Having successfully helped [[building_a_billion_dollar_company | build a multi-billion dollar company]] with Goan, Vu Tran discovered his passion for the early stages of building a business and having a direct impact as a founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. He thrives in small, nimble teams where decisions can be made quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. He deliberately chose a different industry to learn new skills, moving away from B2B SaaS, where he gained most of his tech experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.

### Specific Technology Focus: Solid Rocket Propellant
The company is focused on solid rocket propellant and solid rocket motors, fundamental components of rockets and missiles that have seen little change in nearly a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>. Vu Tran highlights a "500 billion dollar backlog" across the top three US defense primes, largely due to a shortage of solid rocket motors, indicating a significant market opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>.

### Scalability and Innovation
A core principle for the new company is scalability. Vu Tran emphasizes that unless a defense solution can scale significantly, it's not worth pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. He notes that the cost of innovation and [[building a successful tech startup | building new things]] is cheaper today due to technological advancements in areas like marketing, HR, and cloud services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. This enables smaller, more agile companies to innovate faster than traditional, large defense primes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>.

### Funding Strategy
The aim is to bootstrap the company, prioritizing capital efficiency and cash flow positivity over traditional venture capital funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>. Vu Tran acknowledges the difficulty of raising capital in defense due to ESG requirements and bank lending policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>.

### Team and Culture
The team is built on a shared mission: "defending our way of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:43">[01:15:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. Vu Tran fosters an environment where intensity comes from within the team, driven by commitment to the mission, rather than top-down pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>. He highlights examples of young, dedicated team members, including a 19-year-old who built a guidance system and a defense intern who designed a rocket launcher for a Ute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06">[01:22:06]</a>. This focus on "product velocity" is being introduced to an industry often considered archaic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>.

## Arguments Against and Counterarguments

*   **Focus on Peace and Diplomacy:** Critics argue that efforts should focus on diplomacy and peace, not weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>. Vu Tran counters that "you almost can't have one without the other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>. His company's goal is to make Australia a "porcupine" or "Akida" – too "spiky" and hard to digest for potential aggressors, serving as a defensive deterrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32">[01:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Incumbents:** Large defense contractors argue they have the space covered and that small startups are unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>. Vu Tran draws an analogy to IBM and Salesforce, asserting that innovation often comes from smaller disruptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.
*   **Lack of Patriotism:** Some argue that younger generations lack the patriotism to support defense efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Vu Tran believes that when challenged, Australians will value their way of life and work to preserve it, regardless of overt patriotism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.

Ultimately, Vu Tran approaches this new venture with optimism, hoping that the world will be a better place where his company's products are never needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:44">[01:10:44]</a>. If the company were to "go out of business because there is no demand and everything is sweet," he would be "incredibly happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>.

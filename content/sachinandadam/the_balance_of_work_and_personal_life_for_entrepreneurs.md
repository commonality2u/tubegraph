For entrepreneurs, navigating the intense demands of building a company while maintaining a fulfilling personal life is a persistent challenge. David Booth, co-founder of On Deck, shares his insights on this delicate equilibrium, reflecting on his own experiences with hyper-growth, difficult decisions, and the evolution of his priorities.

## The Founder's Dilemma: Prioritizing Family Amidst Ambition
Many founders face the constant tension between working tirelessly on their business and prioritizing their family. David Booth notes that he constantly strived to do both, trying to "balance the two" [00:45:43]. This drive is often rooted in ambition, which can be a powerful force [00:11:14].

Booth emphasizes the importance of being intentional about one's priorities, particularly as life stages change. He now aims to build his [[ambition_and_personal_life_balance | ambition and personal life balance]] around his life, rather than the other way around [00:45:54].

### Navigating Chaos and Building Capacity
During the rapid growth of On Deck, Booth experienced a period of intense work, spanning multiple time zones and demanding "Dawn till Dusk" effort [00:43:23]. He likened his brain to a muscle, constantly working to its limit, which ultimately expanded his capacity [00:43:57]. This experience cultivated his ability to "constructively navigat[e] chaos" [00:44:48]. While he no longer desires to "grind on that kind of level," he knows he can if necessary [00:44:50].

This heightened capacity, combined with the personal development he underwent as a leader, led to increased emotional intelligence [00:45:22]. This internal growth, a form of [[personal_growth_and_work_life_balance | Personal Growth and Work Life Balance]], helped him better understand and relate to others, including his executive team [00:45:24].

## Chapters of Life and Partner Support
Booth stresses that life occurs in "chapters" [00:49:29], such as before and after having children. It is crucial to have a clear understanding and communication with one's partner about these periods of intensity [00:50:02]. For instance, communicating that "for the next 3 months life is going to be crazy but there's going to be another end" can be effective [00:50:15]. However, if such seasons extend for years without clear communication, relationships can deteriorate [00:50:21].

Booth describes his wife as a "force of stability" to his "force of chaos" [00:46:50], highlighting the symbiotic nature of their relationship [01:03:00]. This complementary dynamic has been crucial as they have been together for 15 years and married for eight [00:46:58].

He acknowledges that many successful founders in their 30s are simultaneously in the early stages of family building [00:47:50]. This means they are often "particularly spread thin" while attempting to manage both their careers and personal lives [00:48:11]. The recognition of these trade-offs, such as a conference speaker potentially sacrificing a night with their kids, is vital [00:48:40].

While living in San Francisco, Booth and his family faced quality of life considerations, including safety, school quality, and political uncertainty, as well as the reality of active shooter drills for children [00:59:43]. Ultimately, their decision to return to New Zealand was a "quality of life decision" [00:59:30], driven by the desire for a suitable environment to raise their kids [00:58:55]. This illustrates the complex nature of [[balancing_career_goals_with_personal_life_and_family | balancing career goals with personal life and family]].

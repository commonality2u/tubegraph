Running a fast-growing company while raising a family presents unique challenges, often leading to a constant balancing act. The speaker, a founder and CEO, openly discusses the realities of this demanding lifestyle, particularly highlighting her move to New York with her family to be at the forefront of a generational shift in the workforce.

## The Constant Internal Monologue: Not Fast Enough, Not Present Enough

Inside her internal monologue, the CEO reveals two primary anxieties: the fear that a competitor is building a faster, leaner, quicker, and better version of her company, leading to a constant feeling of "not going fast enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. Complementing this professional stress is a personal one: the constant feeling of "not being present" as a mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. She is "always stressing about the fact that I'm not being present in that present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. These two themes represent her main internal conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## Fueling the Drive: Passion and Heritage

Despite the relentless schedule, the CEO possesses a significant amount of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. While acknowledging that recent travel might place her at her "lowest energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>, she attributes her drive to her genetic upbringing and an inherent passion for her work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. Her company is solving one of the "most critical problems that we could be solving right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>, which fuels her.

Her deep-seated drive to build and create stems from an early age, even running a baking business at 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. This ambition is further amplified by her Irish heritage and upbringing as one of twelve children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. Growing up without much money instilled a strong work ethic, allowing her to "outwork anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. With eight brothers, there was an inherent competition about "who's going to be more successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>, providing a competitive edge that makes business competitors "nothing" compared to her family dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

The decision to move to New York was driven by the unprecedented "once in a generation change to work" due to massive market transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Feeling she would be "missing out" if not at the forefront, her "whole family's All In" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Her daughters often accompany her to meetings "because I don't have an N and they have to come with me and they know the rules when we're on work mode we're working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## The Reality of [[The balance of work and personal life for entrepreneurs | Work-Life Balance]] for Founders

When asked about [[Balancing Family and Career Success | rebalancing]] and showing up with energy daily, the CEO candidly admits she is "probably not a good example of it this year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>, describing her year as "relentless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>. She challenges the expectation of [[Balancing Career and Family for Women in Business | balance]] for women with children in her position:
> "I don't have any balance. I don't think I can have balance in if I'm trying to build something this big." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>

Her previous schedule involved working from 4:00 a.m. daily to be online with America, which made mornings with her kids "horrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Juggling Multiple Demands

While admitting a lack of traditional "balance," she does employ strategies to manage her time and energy:
*   **Day Theming and Time Blocking**: This approach has been "transformational" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>, allowing her to dedicate certain days or blocks of time to specific tasks (e.g., cramming all meetings/one-on-ones, or all content creation tasks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>.
*   **Leveraging AI for Productivity**: She uses AI extensively, with about "30 workers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:00">[22:07:00]</a> trained on her voice for content creation, investor reports, and other tasks, which allows her to "pump out so much work now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:00]</a>.
*   **"Adventure Fridays"**: To be more present with her daughters, she plans to institute "Adventure Fridays," picking them up early from school and doing an activity, compensating by working online on Sundays to connect with her Australian team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:00">[20:37:00]</a>.

## The Internal Conflict: "Is It Worth It?"

The CEO regularly grapples with the internal conflict of whether the sacrifices are worth it:
> "I have a very regular conflict where it's like I've sacrificed everything for this... I've given up so much time not going to things, not being present even when I'm doing things." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:56:00">[34:56:00]</a>

She openly states that the startup journey is "not one that you're half in," calling it "all consuming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:27:00">[35:27:00]</a>. Her current focus is solely on "work and babies," with "nothing else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:31:00">[35:31:00]</a>.

What keeps her going is the "impact that we're going to have in society as a whole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05:00">[36:05:00]</a>. Her mission is to ensure everyone has access to meaningful work in a world transformed by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>. For her, this is "bigger than me, it's bigger than the girls, it's more than money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:20:00">[36:20:00]</a>. To integrate her children into this journey, she creates content with them, making them "part of this story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:49:00">[33:49:00]</a>. Her daughters understand the business, feeling the vibes when things don't go well, and are "getting the best training when you think about like early stage entrepreneurial life training" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:41:00">[36:41:00]</a>. They even state their goal is to "take over Manhattan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:58:00">[33:58:00]</a>.

### The Honest Truth about Founding with Kids
> "If you've got kids by the way, you're going to struggle to figure out that one and if anyone needs to talk about that slack me because I'll tell you it's going to be okay, just keep going, just keep building." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:52:00">[39:52:00]</a>

She expresses frustration with motivational content that sugarcoats the founder's journey, emphasizing that "being a founder is horrible, like it's really hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a> and requires immense "grit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:44:00">[39:44:00]</a>.

## Democratizing Opportunity and Future Chapters

The CEO believes there has "never been a better time to build" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:36:00">[37:36:00]</a>, as technology now allows anyone from any background to build software without formal training, thus "democratizing opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:56:00">[37:56:00]</a>. She acknowledges that her current phase is "relentless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:33:00">[38:33:00]</a>, but anticipates future chapters where she may "pull back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:39:00">[38:39:00]</a>, though she currently thrives as a "wartime CEO" in the trenches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[38:46:00]</a>.

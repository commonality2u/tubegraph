Fred Schebesta, founder of Finder and author of *Go Live*, is described as a true visionary who perceives the world uniquely and anticipates trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. His approach to business and life reflects a deep curiosity, a willingness to take risks, and a relentless forward-looking perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Defining Traits and Early Influences

Schebesta's [[personal_experiences_and_goals_in_entrepreneurship | entrepreneurial journey]] began with an innate curiosity, evident from a childhood anecdote where, at seven, he cut the live electric cable of his clock to use a piece for another experiment, realizing the danger but also the fascination of deconstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This act highlighted his inclination to "cut cables," take chances, and do things others might not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

He acknowledges that early in his life, he lacked self-confidence and judged himself, feeling like a "fraud" while conforming to expectations at a traditional school and university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. He stopped doing things he disliked, even everyday chores, to focus entirely on what he loved and found purpose in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This commitment to authenticity is a core part of his character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## Guiding Principles and Outlook

Fred Schebesta's [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_mindset | mindset]] is shaped by several core principles:

*   **Forward Movement**: He primarily lives in the future, focusing on how to reach it rather than dwelling on the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Pattern Recognition**: He observes "programmed human behaviors" and societal movements, particularly at the "edges of humanity" (those at the bottom striving to rise, or those at the top resisting descent), which often indicate new adoptions or trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. His insight into TikTok's rise from observing people dancing with their phones exemplifies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **"Memento Mori"**: A personal reminder that "one day you will die" helps him make decisions, encouraging him to live a life aligned with his envisioned legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Energy Management**: He makes changes when he feels he's not in his "highest energy space" or "flow," prioritizing his contribution and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Enterprise in All Aspects**: He views a household as an intricate business, suggesting that mundane problems, like laundry, can be approached with an [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_mindset | enterprising mindset]] to create efficient systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## Vision for the Future

Schebesta's visionary outlook extends to global challenges and technological advancements:

### Space Exploration and Humanity's Evolution
He advocates for humanity's push into space, investing in companies like SpaceX, believing it to be the ultimate frontier for knowledge and survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. He posits that experiencing the harshness of other planets like Mars could profoundly shift humanity's perspective on Earth's fragility and encourage better environmental stewardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

He theorizes that humans, much like a virus, have an "undeniable desire for growth" and continuous dissatisfaction, which drove them to the top of the food chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. Expanding into space provides more resources to manage this inherent drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

### The Metaverse and Societal Impact
Schebesta believes humanity is "very, very close to going full metaverse," a transition accelerated by COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. He notes the emerging trend of people earning more money in games like Axie Infinity than in the real world, signifying a fundamental shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>. He is optimistic that the metaverse could significantly re-distribute wealth and income globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

### Economic Shifts: UBI, Arts, and Environmentalism
He forecasts that as AI and automation increase, leading to a Universal Basic Income (UBI), society will experience a "renaissance" where arts and culture will flourish, and actors could become some of the wealthiest people due to the increasing demand for entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. Additionally, environmentalism will become a premium, with more jobs focused on protecting nature, especially pristine, untouched environments like those found in Australia, which he sees as an "undervalued resource" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.

## Approach to Ideas and Learning

Schebesta's company, Finder, was his 40th idea, indicating a long process of experimentation and learning from prior "failures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. His method for generating ideas involves:

*   **Active Listening**: Paying attention to "tiny little variations and bumps of people's lives" and identifying moments of excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.
*   **Embracing Discomfort**: When his mind encounters a mild challenge or something "outside the standard deviation" (remarkable), he leans into it, getting "uncomfortable as quickly as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. This requires returning to a beginner's mindset and making mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.

## Cryptocurrency Philosophy

Regarding cryptocurrency, Schebesta emphasizes Bitcoin as the foundational "hard money" backing the entire crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>. He advises new users to "just buy Bitcoin" to start, as it inevitably leads them down the "rabbit hole" to explore other altcoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. Having experienced the crypto winter, he notes that Bitcoin's resilience and battle-tested nature make it stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>.

## Personal Growth and Purpose

Schebesta highlights the importance of continuous self-improvement and setting clear intentions. His advice for young leaders on living a good life includes:

*   **Never Stop Wanting More**: Even when you feel you know everything, acknowledge that you likely only know "two percent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>. Continuously seeking more gives purpose, direction, and helps one aspire beyond imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
*   **Confronting Self-Limiting Beliefs**: He encourages awareness of one's internal dialogue and the "judgment upon yourself" that leads to feelings of not being "good enough" or "worthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>. By recognizing and working to change this self-talk, one can overcome these limiting beliefs and fully experience joy in their achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>. He suggests writing down negative self-talk and emotionally charged reactions to understand their root causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>.
*   **Create Your Purpose**: Instead of waiting to discover purpose, he advises simply "making one up" that pushes you outside your comfort zone, as "life begins there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. This self-defined purpose provides an overriding direction that minimizes the impact of life's inevitable challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:37">[00:53:37]</a>.

Fred Schebesta's [[impact_of_personal_experiences_on_entrepreneurship | unique blend]] of curiosity, strategic foresight, and relentless self-actualization provides a compelling framework for aspiring entrepreneurs and visionaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.

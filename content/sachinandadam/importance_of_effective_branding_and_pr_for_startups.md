This article explores the critical role of strategic communications, branding, and public relations (PR) for startups, drawing insights from Jesse Woo, founder and managing director of Encore, a new tech communications firm.

## Introducing Encore and Jesse Woo
Jesse Woo, an experienced VC in the Australian ecosystem and former partner at Afterwork Ventures, has launched her own strategic communications agency, Encore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Encore aims to empower clients to "command the narrative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The firm focuses on tech communications, offering expertise in good branding and PR, as well as navigating the pitfalls of bad branding and PR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Why Branding and PR Matter for Startups
In the startup world, effective communication is often underestimated compared to product development or distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. The fundamental challenge for a startup is that "nobody cares what you do, nobody cares if you fail or succeed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. If a company is creating a new category, its existence may not even be known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

The purpose of communications for startups is to:
*   **Raise the Stakes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>: Make people care about your success or failure, compelling them to take desired actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
*   **Drive Business Outcomes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>: This includes prompting actions like signing up for a waiting list, agreeing to a demo, purchasing a product, or evangelizing the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. It also extends to attracting talent and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **Build a Bridge to Understanding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>: Effective communication connects a new product to things people already care about, providing a reference point for how it creates value in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

Ultimately, good communication helps companies to "sell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.

## Encore's Approach to Strategic Communications
Encore advocates for a distinctive approach to communications, especially for challenger brands and startups.

### Standing Out: Polarization and Risk-Taking
Traditional corporate communications are often risk-averse, leading to generic, buzzword-filled messages that lack memorability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. While large corporates prioritize preserving their market leader status, startups operate from a place of obscurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

> [!info] The Risk of Omission
> For upstarts, the greater risk is omission â€“ not taking risks in communications, which leads to being "drowned in the jaws of obscurity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
>
> Being polarizing can inspire tribalism and loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. When a brand resonates strongly with one group, it will inevitably alienate others, but not everyone is in a company's addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. Polarizing communication can highlight core values, strengthening the connection with loyal customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. Apple is cited as an example, building a strong brand identity around a specific customer vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

Taking risks in communications creates valuable feedback loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. By observing what messages resonate or fall flat, startups can iterate, compound their learnings, and drive their brand in the right direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

### Channel Agnostic Distribution
Encore's strategy prioritizes driving business outcomes, making the choice of communication channel secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. The focus is on "what belief we need to instill in what audience so they take what action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>, regardless of whether that channel is mainstream print media, television, social media, or niche creator-powered platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.

For specific audiences (e.g., CFOs, product managers), specialized trade publications or podcasts may be far more influential than broad national media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. Niche newsletters with smaller but highly engaged communities can be crucial for reaching early adopters and fervent evangelists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.

Founders also have the opportunity to go direct, building a strong presence on platforms like Twitter through original, organic content, rather than solely relying on traditional publications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

### Measuring Success
Success metrics for communications campaigns should be aligned with the company's Northstar metrics, focusing on tangible business outcomes rather than just media coverage. Examples include the number of waitlist sign-ups or B2B leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

## The Role of Personal Branding for Founders
Personal branding is viewed as highly impactful and scalable, allowing individuals to put their values, personality, and humor out into the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Being authentic online can lead to unexpected and meaningful connections, both personally and professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Every good thing that has happened to the podcast hosts, including jobs and interviews, has stemmed from online content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

> [!tip] Quality Over Quantity
> It's not always about the quantity of followers, but the quality of what is shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Standing firmly for one's beliefs provides a more complete view of character than generic, commodified content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. When you stand for something, you find your "tribe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.

## Leveraging Cultural Nuances: Australian Context
Australian culture, with its emphasis on "championing the everyman" and being "down-to-earth and relatable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, presents a unique context for [[the_influence_of_branding_on_vc_firms_and_startups | branding and marketing strategies]]. Companies can tap into these narratives to define their tribe and supercharge their brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.

An example is Slice, a "layby for travel" product. Their campaign highlighted the founders' humble origins and a relatable aspiration for travel among middle Australians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. By centering stories like that of their first customer, who took his family on a trip using Slice, they attracted a tribe well-suited to their product, demonstrating that "standing for something" can align with cultural traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.

## The Future of PR: AI-Powered Insights
While no longer a VC, Jesse Woo sees a clear opportunity for AI tools to enhance the work of PR and communications professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:25">[00:50:25]</a>. AI can assist in:
*   **Trend Identification and Newsjacking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>: Tools can crawl publications, social media platforms (TikTok, Reddit, Hacker News), and sub-forums to identify keywords and trends picking up momentum in specific subcommunities, especially those that tend to go mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Accelerating Clues** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>: AI can provide early clues, allowing humans to apply taste and judgment to determine resonance and global spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>.
*   **Fueling Outbound Motions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>: Spotting emerging trends like "run clubs" allows PR firms to proactively engage relevant clients (e.g., health and wellness companies, dating apps) to leverage the trend before it fully crests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>.

This integration of AI is not meant to substitute human work, but to deliver more impactful campaigns and identify opportunities for clients to newsjack cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>.

## Case Studies in Startup PR: Good vs. Bad

### MilkRun (Damaging Overhype)
MilkRun's PR was initially seen as successful due to extensive press coverage, including an AFR magazine article that called them an "overnight success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>. However, this early, overly fawning coverage proved damaging because it:
*   **Set a Target** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>: It put a target on their back, giving opponents ammunition to criticize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.
*   **Created Unrealistic Expectations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>: Features like paying riders above market rates, offering free delivery, and a 10-minute promise were highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>. When these changed, subsequent negative coverage disproportionately amplified the setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>.
*   **Became a Symbol of Excess** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>: MilkRun became a metonym for the excesses of the 2021 VC-fueled startup hype cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>, leading to a "disproportionate amount of coverage on the way down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
*   **Impacted Morale** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>: This negatively affected internal morale and distracted the founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.

The outcome for MilkRun was compounded by unfortunate timing, specifically the end of a low-interest-rate cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>.

### Canva (High Variance, Viral Potential)
Canva's enterprise event, featuring a "big song and dance" that was widely perceived as "cringe," generated over 100 million impressions on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>. This was a "high variance thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a> that took a risk and went viral, generating massive top-of-funnel awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>. The success of this campaign in driving actual business outcomes (Enterprise conversion) is harder to adjudicate from the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

### TBH Skincare (Owning the Narrative)
TBH Skincare, an Australian company, experienced a meme they created going viral on TikTok but then being taken out of context and generating significant negative and misogynistic commentary on Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:55">[01:04:55]</a>.

> [!example] Using Alienation to Highlight Core Values
> TBH Skincare's response was to "use alienation to highlight your core values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:32">[01:06:32]</a>. They created a follow-up video, taking the worst comments and owning them in the same fun, high-energy style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>. This act of "clapping back" further endeared them to their target audience of young Gen Z/Millennial women, demonstrating resilience and celebrating femininity, while the negative opinions of men who weren't their customers didn't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.
>
> This contrasts with risk-averse corporate advice to "don't engage, don't dignify it with a response" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. Instead, it highlights the opportunity to command the narrative rather than letting others define it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:50">[01:08:50]</a>.

## Core Principles for Encore: Making the Right People Famous and Truth
Jesse Woo envisions Encore as a "lever and a fulcrum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:48">[01:09:48]</a>.
*   **The Lever (Platform/Fame)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>: Encore helps clients build a platform and audience, giving them a "long lever" to create impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>. The principle is to "make the right people famous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This means having the integrity to decline working with clients who are unscrupulous, abusive to employees, or neglectful of customer outcomes, regardless of payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>.
*   **The Fulcrum (Truth)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>: As a communications agency, Encore's fulcrum is truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>. This stands against obscuring or twisting the truth, or hiding facts from journalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. While misinformation exists, the current world allows truth to emerge through various channels, including citizen journalism and government investigations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>. The goal is to help clients change and do good, rather than just covering up misdeeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>.
> [!quote] Archimedes' Principle
> "Give me a long lever long enough and a fork room on which to play it and I can move the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>

This commitment to truth and promoting ethical actors underscores Encore's vision for creating lasting positive change through strategic communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:54">[01:15:54]</a>.

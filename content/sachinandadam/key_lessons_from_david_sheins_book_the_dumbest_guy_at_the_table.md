David Shein, the founder of Australia's first unicorn company, Comtech, and co-founder of the emergent VC fund OIF, authored the book *The Dumbest Guy at the Table* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The book provides deep [[leadership_lessons_and_company_building_in_the_tech_industry | insights]] into building enduring companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Facing Reality and Embracing Change
A core principle in Shein's book is "face reality as it is, not as it was or you wish it to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This lesson, influenced by Jack Welch's rules for success, emphasizes the importance of adaptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Shein also highlights the related principle: "change before you have to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

He illustrates this with examples:
*   The startup capital market, which was easy nine months ago, is now much tougher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Founders must [[challenges_and_reflections_in_business_decision_making | face this reality]] and adjust by extending their last funding round or cutting costs to extend runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   Fairfax Media failed to adapt to the internet era, despite having an opportunity to revolutionize its business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Companies like Seek, REA, and CarSales emerged and "killed Fairfax" because Fairfax didn't face reality and change when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Principles of Business Building
### Sales-Led Model and Legendary Customer Service
Shein believes in the principle of "what you say is what you do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Comtech earned customer confidence by never making promises they couldn't deliver on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. When problems arose, there was no finger-pointing; the focus was always on solving the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

Shein often states that Comtech's business "was built on problems and our ability to solve those problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. This was achieved by having a highly energized team with both the ability and the attitude to fix problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. They focused on delivering "legendary customer service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

### Identifying and Nurturing Talent
Shein, despite not being a natural technologist, attributes his success to his ability to identify talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. His approach is to "hire for attitude, train for skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. He values people with the right attitude and ability over those with numerous academic qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

Examples of his hiring philosophy:
*   **Scott Petty**: Hired at 18 without a university degree, he worked in six different roles at Comtech before becoming the CTO of Vodafone in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   **Dave Colvin**: Hired from a competitor's warehouse because of his attitude and technical ability, despite not having a degree and perceived unconventional appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. He became one of the best tech guys Shein ever worked with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.

Shein stresses that a degree is "not the be-all and end-all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>; attitude and being a team player are equally, if not more, important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

## Life Lessons Beyond Business
### Finding Purpose After Success
After selling Comtech for over a billion dollars, Shein found himself feeling unfulfilled, describing it as "debilitating" to have nothing to do and not be able to add value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. He likens it to sportspeople who quit and have no plan for what comes next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

His turning point came when he helped an early-stage speech recognition company called Holly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. This experience made him realize he could make a difference and add value without being the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. This realization defined his career path from 2001 until he co-founded OIF in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

### OIF's Philosophy: The Three F's
OIF's mission is built on three core principles, or "three F's":
1.  **Founders**: OIF is 120% committed to its founders, viewing them as customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. They aim to add value beyond just providing capital, which is seen as a commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>.
2.  **Fund**: As stewards of their investors' capital (high-net-wealth individuals, not institutional money), they are committed to delivering returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. Their goal is to make five times their investment with a happy founder, rather than seven times by "screwing the founder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.
3.  **Fun**: They aim to work with people they genuinely want to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.

Shein notes that their thematic approach is "founder-led," meaning they invest in founders they believe in, who then guide them into fast-growing industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.

### Desirable Qualities in Founders
When evaluating founders, Shein looks for four key qualities:
*   **Energy**: The founder must possess high energy to navigate challenges like pandemics and difficult capital markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>.
*   **Ability to Energize**: A founder needs to inspire and convince people (CTOs, early customers, etc.) to join and believe in their vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.
*   **The Edge**: The capacity to make tough "yes or no" decisions, such as letting go of underperforming staff or pivoting product lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.
*   **Ability to Execute**: The capability to deliver on the presented business plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

Shein believes the current generation of founders, who have endured significant [[challenges_and_reflections_in_business_decision_making | challenges]], will be among the strongest and most resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.

## Personal Values and [[Life Lessons for Future Leaders | Legacy]]
### Family and Staying Grounded
For Shein, his primary goal was always to have a family like the Brosens (founders of Nando's), a family that remained consistently strong through good and bad times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. He never aimed for wealth or a big house; family was paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.

He emphasizes living life according to personal desires, not societal expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>. His advice is to "don't do things that you know if I if I love" just to impress others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. He values staying true to himself and remaining the "same person" he was when he started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>. He considers his "wealth" to be his sons' strong bond and mutual support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>.

### Favorite Book
*   *Right of a Lifetime* by Bob Iger (on Disney) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Shein admired Iger's ability to be both an empathetic and high-performing leader, believing these traits are "completely interrelated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

### Favorite Podcast
*   *Masters of Scale* by Reid Hoffman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

### Person to Have Dinner With
*   Mikel Arteta (manager of Arsenal Football Club) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>. Shein is inspired by his [[leadership_insights_and_lessons | leadership]] and management, particularly his tough decision-making shown in the Netflix series *All or Nothing* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>.

### Most Memorable Investment at OIF
*   **InstaCluster**: They invested $3.5 million and returned $70 million, an investment "no one else saw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>.

### Text Message to the World
*   "Listen to John Lennon's words imagine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>. He wishes for a world without borders and conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>.

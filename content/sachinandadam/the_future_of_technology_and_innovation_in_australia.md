Daniel Petre, often referred to as the "grandfather of VC in Australia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> and former head of Microsoft in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, shares his perspectives on the [[innovation_in_australian_technology | future of technology and innovation in Australia]], drawing from his extensive career and philanthropic endeavors. Petre is noted for his remarkable career in Australian tech, including being a VP for Microsoft directly under Bill Gates in the early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, and running three different venture funds: Ecorp, nols, and AirTree, which became the largest venture fund in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Currently, he leads Start Giving, an initiative focused on allocating philanthropic funds to charities and ensuring tech billionaires contribute to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## [[australias_role_and_culture_in_technological_innovation | Australia's Approach to Innovation and Philanthropy]]

Petre highlights a significant cultural difference between Australia and the US regarding philanthropy. While in the US with Microsoft, he observed people discussing philanthropy at dinners, contrasting it with Australians often talking about house prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. He describes Australia as "not a very philanthropic country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Data shows Australia is well under countries like Canada, the US, the UK, and New Zealand in GDP-level philanthropy, and wealthy Australians are even less philanthropic than the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

This cultural gap is partly attributed to the removal of estate taxes in Australia in the 1970s, which occurred due to a knee-jerk reaction rather than economic analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Without estate taxes and a strong culture of giving, philanthropy has not grown at the same rate as wealth in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Petre believes that wealthy and powerful individuals should be held accountable, stating that billionaires not giving a substantial portion of their money should be "called out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. He emphasizes that no one should sit on a billion dollars without considering helping those who are suffering or lack opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

He advocates for a fairer tax system where wealthy individuals pay more, with that money directed to social services that create a more equal society, including better access to education and health services, and support for women re-entering the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

## [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_australian_tech_ecosystem | The Australian Tech Ecosystem: Past, Present, and Future]]

Petre expresses strong positive sentiment about [[innovation_in_australian_technology | innovation being the future of the Australian economy]] and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. The growth of the venture capital industry is seen as a crucial catalyst for the innovation environment, with increasing funds and a broader range of VC firms being positive developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. Young people today are keen to work for startups, inspired by companies like Atlassian and Canva, as well as a myriad of others across diverse sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>.

### Growth and Talent

The Australian tech sector is projected to become the country's biggest employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Australia possesses a prolific research base, particularly in medical and agricultural research, which is world-class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. The ability to translate this research into global high-tech products represents an enormous opportunity, with significant returns for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

### Criticisms and Challenges

Despite the positives, Petre cautions that the Australian tech ecosystem might be "a little bit ahead of ourselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>. He notes that the period from 2012 to 2020 saw relatively easy success for venture capitalists due to the consistent growth of SaaS and e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. However, he believes the industry has "indexed more to marketing than to delivery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

A significant concern is the power dynamic between venture capital firms and founders. When companies struggle, they often don't receive the promised attention from VCs, who tend to only spend time with successful companies. This creates a situation where struggling companies cannot complain without being further stigmatized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>.

Petre also critiques the Australian media landscape, particularly publications like the AFR, for their limited understanding and under-allocation of resources to technology reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. He argues that editors of major traditional media outlets "just don't understand tech" or its critical importance to Australia's future economic stability and global competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:57">[01:12:57]</a>.

## [[the_future_of_food_and_ag_tech_innovations | Emerging Sectors and Opportunities]]

The next wave of growth and [[australias_path_to_becoming_a_tech_superpower | innovation in Australian technology]] is expected to shift beyond SaaS and e-commerce. Petre highlights specific sectors with significant opportunities:
*   Machine learning and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>
*   Biotech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>
*   Med tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>
*   Climate tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>
*   Agri tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>

These "deeper domain spaces" require deeper thought and specialized knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:06">[00:58:06]</a>. He suggests Australia needs fewer general-purpose venture funds and more "scaled thematic funds" capable of deep investment in these specific areas, particularly biotech and med tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>.

## [[the_impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | The Future of Work and Skills in an AI World]]

Petre acknowledges that many high-paying jobs in law, accounting, and professional services will be impacted by AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>. Even coding, while still relevant, may not have the same clear long-term growth as AI engines become more productive in assisting coders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.

He emphasizes that skills that are harder for bots to replicate, both physically and in software, are empathy and human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. While AI can pick moods and mimic interaction, the fundamental human need to connect with other humans will remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>.

For future students, Petre advises pursuing a mix of disciplines, such as Commerce and Psychology, or Engineering and Psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>. This combination would provide deep science and tech knowledge, teaching logical thinking, alongside skills in working better with other humans, showing true empathy, and building relationships and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>. The domain of knowledge will change, so the crucial aspect will be the skills acquired, particularly thinking and human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a>.

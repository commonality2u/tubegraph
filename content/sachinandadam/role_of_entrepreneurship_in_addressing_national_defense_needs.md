Vu Tran, co-founder of the multi-billion dollar edtech company Goan, has embarked on a new venture: founding a defense company focused on rockets and guided weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This shift highlights a growing belief that entrepreneurial innovation is crucial for national defense.

## The Drive for Sovereign Capability

Tran's motivation stems from a concern for Australia's sovereignty and sovereign capability in defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. Without the ability to produce its own defense goods, a country becomes dependent on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

Australia spends between $50 and $55 billion annually on defense, ranking 13th globally in raw spending and eighth per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. Despite this, only one Australian company, Austal, is among the top 100 global defense companies, and its ranking has recently fallen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. This means Australia largely buys its technology from overseas, primarily the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

> "If the US goes to war with someone, guess what? We are too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

This dependency means Australia's decisions can be influenced by its allies' conflicts, limiting its autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. Tran argues that [[building_a_defense_company | building a defense company]] locally can provide Australia with greater choice in geopolitical decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.

### Preparing for War to Ensure Peace

Tran's new company is being built with the intention of preparing for war, in the hope that it will never happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This philosophy is likened to a fire extinguisher manufacturer not hoping for fires, or a doctor not hoping for sick people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:51">[01:16:51]</a>. The core mission is to defend Australia's way of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>.

The "porcupine strategy" or "Akida strategy" is a key defensive concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. This involves making a country "spiky" or "hard to digest" to deter potential attackers, without necessarily intending to kill or prey on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Approach to Defense

Tran's journey from Goan to defense is a [[transitioning_from_edtech_to_defense_industry | transitioning from edtech to defense industry]] driven by a personal passion for building and tackling challenging problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Founding Team and Culture
Tran emphasizes the importance of a strong, complementary co-founding team for success, like the one he had at Goan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. He highlights the value of trust and honesty among co-founders, allowing for difficult conversations and rapid decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. His experience [[impact_of_personal_experiences_on_entrepreneurship | impact of personal experiences on entrepreneurship]] growing up with entrepreneurial refugee parents who ran businesses in Logan, instilled a "hustle and grind" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.

Tran identifies himself as "unemployable" due to his high value for agency and autonomy, which aligns with the entrepreneurial path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:03">[02:11:03]</a>.

### [[entrepreneurship_and_decisionmaking | Entrepreneurship and Decision-making]] and Risk
Tran possesses a "remarkable bias for action," which, while sometimes leading to trouble, has been crucial for building businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>. His early entrepreneurial experiences, like building websites as a teenager, allowed him and his co-founders to learn when "nothing was on the line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

Regarding [[entrepreneurship_and_risk_management_strategies | entrepreneurship and risk management strategies]], Tran mentions using credit cards "like they were Pok√©mon cards" in Goan's early days due to the lack of a VC industry in Australia at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. He also shares that his medical degree provided a "risk-free" fallback, allowing him to take the plunge into entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.

Tran advises new founders to understand their "why" beyond mission statements, focusing on the core reason they want to build something together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>. He also stresses the importance of asking "how" rather than "can we" to foster problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:23:59]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities in Defense

### Industry Structure and Innovation
The traditional defense industry, often referred to as the military-industrial complex, is criticized for being inefficient and not fit for the current global environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. Tran aims to change this from within rather than criticizing from afar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.

There is a significant lack of innovation in defense, with technologies like solid rocket propellant remaining unchanged for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a>. This stagnation creates an opportunity for new players. The global defense backlog is estimated at trillions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>.

### [[the_role_of_government_in_supporting_startups | The Role of Government]]
Tran believes government should not be directly designing or building complex technologies like defense systems, similar to how they wouldn't build their own accounting software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. Instead, innovation is best fostered in the private sector, potentially with public sector assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>. While the government is the sole customer for certain defense products like rockets, customers don't always know what they need in the long term, and often cannot build it themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>.

### Cost and Capital in Defense
The cost to innovate and build businesses has decreased significantly due to technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. Software like Squarespace and Canva have reduced operational costs for startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>.

However, obtaining capital in the defense sector, particularly for "lethality" (bombs, missiles), is challenging due to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) requirements and bank policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>. Tran aims to [[building_a_defense_company | build a defense company]] that is capital-efficient and cash-flow positive, akin to businesses from 50 years ago that focused on profit without relying on VC money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>.

### Talent and Velocity
Tran highlights the importance of product velocity, which is often new to older, more archaic industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:49">[01:22:49]</a>. He shares an example of a 19-year-old team member who built a guidance system and a mechanical engineering intern who designed a rocket launcher for a ute in three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:33">[01:21:33]</a>. He hopes more of Australia's "best and brightest minds" will engage in mission-driven technology like defense and healthcare, rather than solely focusing on optimizing advertising metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>.

## Conclusion

The decision to [[building_a_defense_company | build a defense company]] is a personal one for Tran, driven by a desire to prevent future generations from being involuntarily drawn into conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. This reflects a broader trend of [[entrepreneurship_and_innovation_in_developing_countries | entrepreneurship and innovation in developing countries]] and specific sectors to address critical national needs, even if it means tackling controversial or "hardest challenges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>. Tran's approach embodies the principle of being the change one wishes to see, rather than remaining an external critic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>.

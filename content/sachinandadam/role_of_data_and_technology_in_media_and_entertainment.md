Peter Corbett, a Partner at Deloitte Monitor and head of Monitor Deloitte in Sydney, specializes in strategy consulting. As a former entrepreneur, he has observed the significant impact of [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technology]] and data on various industries, particularly the Telco, Media, and Technology (TMT) sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Convergence of Mega Trends
The TMT industry is experiencing a rapid convergence of mega trends, leading to a faster rate of change compared to other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. These trends include:
*   Artificial Intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>
*   Advanced wireless networks (5G, Wi-Fi 6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>
*   Cloud computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>

These technological shifts affect various media entities, from broadcast companies to journalistic organizations, as exemplified by recent events like Facebook's temporary removal of media sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.

## Deloitte TMT Predictions
Deloitte publishes an annual report called "TMT Predictions," which has been ongoing for 20 years. This report looks one year ahead to identify significant trends shaping the Telco, Media, and Technology industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>.

### Hyper-Quantified Athlete
One prediction highlights the concept of the "hyper-quantified athlete," which focuses on how data can monetize sports that are not traditionally revenue-generating, such as Tier 2 rugby in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. By gathering data on each game, player, and move, it becomes possible to provide streaming content and even opportunities for wagering where none existed before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. This represents just the "tip of the iceberg" for data applications in sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.

### Monetization of Women's Sport
Australia is recognized as a leader in the monetization of women's sport, possessing amazing female sports talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. Globally, the women's sport industry is currently less than a billion dollars, significantly smaller than the multi-billion dollar male-dominated sports industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>. Technology, combined with an emphasis on female talent, presents a major opportunity to create a more equal playing field for women's sport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.

## The Future of Streaming and Subscriptions
[[The evolution and democratization of media | Streaming services]] have significantly disrupted the traditional media and entertainment landscape by offering personalized recommendations and vast content choices, exemplified by companies like Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. This has led to the "unbundling of the pay TV bundle" over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>.

In Australia, 90% of the population has at least one streaming video-on-demand subscription, and 20-25% have at least five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. Across all digital subscriptions (news, music, video, etc.), people average 10 to 12 subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>.

Looking ahead, there are two potential directions for streaming:
1.  **Re-aggregation**: There is a potential need for an aggregator to bring content back together, as searching for specific shows across multiple services is currently challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.
2.  **Business Models**: While subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) is prevalent, there are strong examples of ad-supported models globally, particularly in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>. The balance between what people are willing to pay for and what they are happy to watch with advertising is a key consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.

Exclusivity of content drives competition, leading to significant content budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>. Companies like Apple and Amazon, whose core business models are not content-driven (e.g., selling devices or e-commerce), have intentions around streaming that are decoupled from direct content monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. Their presence and different business models will continue to evolve the competitive landscape of the streaming industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

The dynamic nature of this industry, characterized by the [[future trends in the technology and telecommunications industry | convergence of technologies]] and evolving consumer behaviors, makes it a bellwether for new technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.

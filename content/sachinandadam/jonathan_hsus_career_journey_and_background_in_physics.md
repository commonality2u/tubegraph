Jonathan Hsu is a co-founder of Tribe Capital, one of the first data-driven venture capital (VC) funds globally, managing multiple billions of dollars in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. His career journey is notable for its diverse threads, including a background in physics, founding a company, being a data scientist, and becoming a venture investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Academic and Early Career Foundations

Hsu holds a PhD in physics from Stanford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. His family background was more conservative, with his father working at a bank, and there was a desire for stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. His personal drive to do something different stemmed from an insecurity about not being a great software engineer, leading him to seek "white space" or "blue ocean" areas where others weren't competing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This desire to find unexplored space is also reflected in his hobby as a performing jazz musician for over 20 years, where improvisation and finding new interpretations are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

His first job out of graduate school was as a Product Manager (PM) at Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## The Rise of Data Science

A clear thread throughout Hsu's career is data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. He was among the first five-ish data scientists at Facebook in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Before Facebook, he was involved in data work at Slide, a social gaming company founded by Max Levchin of PayPal and Affirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This period, roughly 2008-2010, was considered the "big data big bang," where companies started having vast amounts of data to analyze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This led to a "Gold Rush" of tech companies hiring PhDs, including physicists, to make sense of this data, eventually leading to the term "data science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Hsu's physics background heavily influenced his approach to data. He views physics as the "greatest quantitative model humans have built," capable of amazing precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This desire to find models that work, whether for running a business or driving product adoption, carried over from his physics training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. He notes that early computer scientists and quantitative hedge fund traders were often physicists or mathematicians, as they were willing to venture into uncharted territory without established models or degree programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Physicists are often good at this because they are willing to be "quantitatively sloppy" and focus on what works, rather than strictly proving things, and also because of historically limited career prospects in pure physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

## Transition to Venture Capital

After leaving Facebook in 2014, where he had hundreds of data scientists reporting to him, Hsu was interested in applying data to venture capital because no one else was doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. While the obvious path would have been to join companies like Airbnb or Uber, he sought a different challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Social Capital

At Social Capital, Hsu and his colleagues aimed to bring the data science principles developed at Facebook to venture investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. They explored various approaches, including scraping data to source companies, but found it marginal because the existing partners already saw plenty of deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Their focus shifted to adapting growth and product-market fit frameworks from the social web to other business models like SaaS, payments, and the sharing economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. The goal was to help entrepreneurs by sharing these models and providing new ways to quantify their businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

Hsu compares their data science approach in VC to how Benjamin Graham first used accounting data to assess company value for investment, creating the basis of fundamental analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. Their frameworks are not about predicting the future but about providing a clear understanding of a company's present and past performance, particularly concerning product-market fit and customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

### Founding Tribe Capital

The decision to start Tribe Capital was out of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. Having developed a data-driven approach that felt like "playing on God mode" – seeing right through a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a> – Hsu and his partners felt that joining a traditional firm would compromise their ability to implement this vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>. Traditional VC firms, built on prior successes and often resistant to changing their established models, would likely not integrate their data-driven approach fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>. Thus, they needed to build their own firm to bring their philosophy to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>.

Raising their first fund was challenging, involving around 700 conversations with Limited Partners (LPs), and complicated further by the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>. The initial thesis was largely understood, but they had to promise to build the necessary software to truly realize their data-driven approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. Five years later, they have built a "giant software system" to deliver value to founders and LPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

## Tribe Capital's Investment and Talent Philosophy

Tribe Capital's investment process involves doing data work on around 400 companies annually, providing quantitative benchmarks and feedback to founders even if they don't invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. This provides tangible value to the ecosystem and helps them gain access to promising companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. While they appear heavily data-indexed externally, internally, their deep-dive process for the 70 companies they seriously consider and the 20 they invest in annually is a mixture of qualitative and quantitative analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. They primarily focus on companies in the $1-10 million revenue range, where there's data but also significant early-stage risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

Hsu's favorite investments often involve situations where other people overlooked a company, such as Docker, which had been through a recapitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. Their data approach allowed them to see the underlying value separate from the past baggage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.

Regarding talent, Hsu emphasizes hiring generalist, flexible individuals for small companies like Tribe Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>. He believes that roles will shift significantly in early-stage environments, so people who can add value regardless of the specific task are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

Hsu is interested in the concept of "atomic units of value," which emerged from the Social Web era with "engagement" being a unit of value separate from revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>. Other examples include gig worker time, compute power (as in crypto), and personal data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>. For Hsu, the key is not just claiming a unit of value, but proving it through widespread user adoption, as seen with Facebook's engagement metrics or the unique transaction handling in India's e-commerce ecosystem by companies like Shiprocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>.

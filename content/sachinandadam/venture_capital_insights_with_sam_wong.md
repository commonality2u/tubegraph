Sam Wong is a partner at Blackbird Ventures, one of Australia's largest and earliest venture firms, offering a unique perspective into the Australian tech [[Navigating venture capital and startup ecosystems | ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Her role involves significant [[Key investments and experiences in venture capital | investments]] and insights into the [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | venture capital]] scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Sam Wong Beyond Venture Capital

Before joining Blackbird Ventures, Sam Wong's diverse background included working as a lawyer and a product manager at Surfstitch in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. She also spent time at Startmate before moving to Blackbird <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Beyond her professional roles, Sam identifies as a highly curious person who enjoys learning new things, doing, and building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Her interest in community led her to start a not-for-profit and explore activities like home composting and permaculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This drive to create and be part of creation defines her beyond her work in [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | startups]] and [[Venture capital strategies and deal winning | investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Defining Venture Capital for Sam Wong

For Sam, being a [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | VC]] means discovering people with unique insights and "magic," who are brave enough to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. It involves joining them on their journey and acting as a partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. She emphasizes humility, recognizing that it's the founders' company and story, and they will always know their business and customers far better than any [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | investor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The role is about surrounding founders with data to help them make informed decisions and allowing them to learn from both mistakes and successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. As early-stage [[Key investments and experiences in venture capital | investors]], Blackbird focuses on being partners to [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | founders]] and [[Key investments and experiences in venture capital | investors]] in companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The best [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | VCs]] bring their whole personality to work, driven by curiosity and a love for building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations in Venture Capital

Sam highlights that ethical considerations have become a critical part of Blackbird's [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | investment]] decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. In their internal process, partners complete a form after pitches, assessing aspects like team, market, distribution, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:09:05]</a>. This forces early conversations with [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | founders]] about how their technology or vision might impact the world, both positively and negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

Sam views these conversations as a test of how deeply a [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | founder]] has considered their life's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. She uses the example of Harrison.ai, a healthcare AI company, whose founders prioritized privacy and ethics as foundational knowledge for building healthcare products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. This demonstrated a profound understanding of the problem and customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## Identifying Promising Founders and Companies

Sam's methodology for [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | investing]] in great, long-lasting companies focuses on several key signals:

*   **Velocity**: [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | Startups]] are designed for rapid growth, so seeing "extraordinary progress with very limited resources" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The best [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | founders]] exhibit "extraordinary output with very little input" and possess an impatience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Measuring Output (Early Stage)**: Since revenue and user growth are lagging indicators, Sam looks for "extreme outlier signals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. For example, Harrison.ai's technical [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | founder]], Angus, built and sold an IVF embryo detection AI product within three to four months while still completing his medical degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:29]</a>. This starkly contrasted with other healthcare AI companies still struggling to acquire data after over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:44]</a>.
*   **Magnetizing Talent**: An ability to attract talent that a [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | startup]] probably has "no right to have at that particular stage" is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. In the beginning, a [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | founder]] sells an idea, vision, and narrative to early employees and [[Key investments and experiences in venture capital | investors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:32]</a>. Attracting amazing talent increases the probability of success, creating a positive compounding effect as more talent is drawn in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Awareness of Bias**: While pattern recognition is important, Sam distinguishes it from bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. She acknowledges the challenge of maintaining a curious mind when seeing numerous similar pitch decks, but stresses that being aware of this bias is the first step to mitigating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:19:09]</a>. Often, a "weirdness" or slight differentiation in a [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | startup]] signals unique potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:36]</a>.

## Learning from Experience: Evolution of Investment Approach

Sam's [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | investing]] approach has evolved. Early in her career, coming from an operator background, it was easy to "fall in love" with ideas and want to build them herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:29]</a>. Now, she is "much quieter" when talking to [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | founders]], actively trying not to plant words or ideas in their minds that aren't their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:36]</a>. She believes success requires the serendipitous coming together of the team, market, and [[Key investments and experiences in venture capital | investors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:10]</a>.

On losses, Sam emphasizes that a high loss rate is inherent to [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | venture capital]] due to the high risk involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:12]</a>. Top-performing funds often have higher loss rates, with up to 60% of portfolios going to zero, but the successful ones work out "spectacularly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:28]</a>. While she learns from misses, she finds it equally important to "double down on winners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:50]</a>. She cautions against over-indexing on "hustle" and "grit," which can prevent zero outcomes but don't necessarily lead to "100x outcomes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:36]</a>. Achieving massive success also relies on luck, market conditions, and the ability to attract the right team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:43]</a>. A key lesson for young people is to "listen twice, speak once" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:26]</a>.

## Thematic Investment Interests

Sam's [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | investment]] focus has shifted to observing where high-quality [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | founders]] are directing their efforts, rather than actively seeking specific themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:35]</a>. However, she notes a few areas of interest:

*   **AgTech and Future Food**: While she previously underestimated the market's rapid reaction and competitiveness in this space, particularly in deep tech, she's learned the importance of global profiles for companies to attract necessary capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:26:18]</a>. She also realized the value of enabling technologies that can sell to more than just the food sector, such as high-value compounds, fertilizers, and food ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:27:04]</a>.
*   **Designing for Neurodiverse Experiences**: This theme is about creating software experiences, especially work-based ones, with neurodiverse conditions like ADHD or autism in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:28]</a>. If software can help these individuals, it can also benefit the broader population suffering from increasing distractibility in the digital age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:42]</a>. This taps into the challenge of improving productivity in an "already digital" world, making user experience paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   **Markets as a Service**: This concept explores how technology can enable markets to form and operate where they were previously uneconomical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:09]</a>. This includes creating efficient "rails" to connect financing for activities like green bonds or climate change finance with on-the-ground projects, which are too small for large banks but desired by big [[Key investments and experiences in venture capital | investors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:32:50]</a>. An example is a portfolio company in EdTech that helps enable people to reskill from declining industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:33:07]</a>.
*   **Deeper into Biology (beyond healthcare)**: This involves exploring opportunities in areas like food and high-value materials that leverage biological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:30]</a>.
*   **Laggard Commerce**: Sam affectionately refers to this as the "next horizon of commerce" – bringing goods and services that are currently offline into a truly digital experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:49]</a>. An example is a New Zealand company digitalizing the 70% of auto parts commerce that remains offline in a multi-trillion dollar industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:34:07]</a>. This is about leveraging existing technologies to bring traditional industries online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:40]</a>.

Sam generally doesn't put too much thought into "trends," especially for seed stage [[Venture capital and startup evaluation | investments]], as by the time something is a trend, it's often too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:37:00]</a>. She notes that the best companies often create their own markets, rather than fitting into existing trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:04]</a>.

## Advice for Young People Entering Tech and Startups

For young people excited about tech and [[Navigating venture capital and startup ecosystems | startups]], Sam's advice is simple: "just do stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.

*   **Action over Theory**: There's "no way to theory your way into [[Navigating venture capital and startup ecosystems | startups]] or even theory your way into [[Venture capital strategies and deal winning | investing]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:10]</a>.
*   **Build and Sell**: Build things at university, don't sit on the sidelines, and, most importantly, ask customers for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:45]</a>. Overcoming the cultural hesitancy around selling and asking for money is crucial, as it's the "only way to know if you're building something of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:39:03]</a>.
*   **Embrace "No"**: Be ready to hear "no," as it's a gift that helps early-stage [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | founders]] learn who their ideal customers are – those who say "yes" quickly to an early or ugly product and provide feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:40:18]</a>.
*   **Build Relationships**: Make relationships with people who can "offer you luck" in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:36]</a>.

## The "Good Life" According to Sam Wong

For Sam, the "good life" is fundamentally about relationships with those closest to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:57]</a>. It involves a sense of contentment and satisfaction, being truly present with loved ones, caring for them, and practicing self-care to feel "well and strong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:16]</a>. Additionally, it includes "servicing a community of people" around her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:24]</a>. Despite the exciting world of [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | venture capital]], Sam maintains a diverse social circle outside of the VC industry, allowing her to discuss a variety of topics beyond work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:42:15]</a>.

## Quick Fire Round Learnings

*   **Favorite Book**: *A Confederacy of Dunces* by John Kennedy Toole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:56]</a>. She considers it a modern fiction masterpiece due to its vivid and real characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:21]</a>.
*   **Favorite Podcasts**: RadioLab (for learning science), Invest Like the Best with Patrick O'Shaughnessy (especially episodes with Naval Ravikant), and Sam Harris's *Making Sense* podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:34">[00:44:26]</a>. She also enjoys *Criminal* by Phoebe Judge for fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:39]</a>.
*   **Favorite Leader Never Met**: Barack Obama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:02]</a>. Sam admires his legacy, oratory, and the "untold story" of his failures before success, which he overcame by focusing on the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:46:06]</a>. This resonates with common struggles like imposter syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:32]</a>.
*   **Favorite Hobby**: Being a mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:52]</a>. She prioritizes being slow and present with her two-year-old daughter, allowing her to discover the world at her own pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:15]</a>. This presence helps build confidence and a map of the world for the child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:31]</a>.

## Final Advice

Sam's advice to her 18 to 25-year-old self would be to develop good habits earlier in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:08]</a>. This includes routines for sleep, eating, exercise, mindfulness, journaling, and saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:16]</a>. Establishing these habits early creates an "amazing foundation" for "infinite growth" in the future, as life tends to become more complicated and stressful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:23">[00:48:37]</a>.

Georgia Vidler, co-founder of Human Health, attributes much of her entrepreneurial drive and the genesis of Human Health to her deeply personal history and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Her journey highlights the profound [[impact_of_personal_experiences_on_entrepreneurship | impact of personal experiences on entrepreneurship]] and the [[motivation_and_background_of_successful_entrepreneurs | motivation and background of successful entrepreneurs]].

## The Genesis of Human Health

Human Health is an application designed to help individuals track treatments and symptoms, providing actionable insights for users and their care teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It primarily serves people with one or more chronic diagnoses, with many users tracking multiple conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Georgia's initial "why" for starting Human Health was profoundly influenced by the grief of losing her father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This experience highlighted issues within the Australian health and hospital system, sparking initial ideas about healthcare improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. However, she initially felt she couldn't tackle such a complex problem alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

A significant part of her motivation also stems from her family's extensive struggles with serious mental illnesses, including bipolar, schizophrenia, and manic depression, which were common throughout her childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Growing up, this was so normalized that she didn't fully grasp its impact on her until later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. She faced her own mental health challenges in her late teens and early twenties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. These experiences, though difficult, became a "blessing" by building empathy and teaching her to listen to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

## Childhood Dreams and Early Career Path

Growing up in Newcastle, north of Sydney, Georgia always felt she would leave her hometown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. She believed she had no limits and could be "so many things at the same time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Her childhood dreams included being an artist, singer, musician, scientist, or architect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Her parents fostered this wide exploration, encouraging her to try activities like art school, singing lessons, tap dancing, and violin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

She now feels her career has allowed her to marry her childhood dreams of art and science, finding variety in her role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Her career pivot into startups was a pivotal moment. While interning at a large Telco around 2010-2011, a finance manager with a side startup encouraged her to consider the startup world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Witnessing young people building "cool stuff" in an incubator resonated more with her than her advertising studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## The Co-Founder Dynamic

Meeting her co-founder, Kate, was described as a "magical" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. They met at Canva, initially as colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. After Georgia left Canva, they reconnected, sharing their life histories and backgrounds, discovering "bizarre" parallels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. They instantly felt a "yin and yang" dynamic, being very complementary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

Kate's own deep experiences with the health system, particularly as a parent of two children with autism, provided a clear reason for her connection to Human Health's mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. Georgia's personal history of family mental illness and her own struggles provided a similarly deep resonance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

Their complementary nature extends to their work styles: Kate is more structured, while Georgia causes "chaos" that Kate cleans up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. They are both creative but in different ways, never disagreeing on the core vision for Human Health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. In product, Kate focuses on data structures and backend, while Georgia prefers the look, feel, and user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

Georgia acknowledges that starting a company with someone truly reveals their character, and they are stronger for having navigated that process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. The journey of Human Health has felt "magical," with many "miracles" seemingly out of their control, such as Kate's family making one of the last flights to Australia before COVID-19 hit, allowing them to meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

## Resilience and Purpose

Georgia's personal history, including losing her father and growing up with mental illness in her family, has forged a deep resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. On tough days, she reminds herself, "I've been through way worse than this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. This internal reserve allows her to persist through challenges, knowing she has overcome darker moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. She sees her personal struggles as having built empathy and the ability to listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

Her purpose, which became clear through the Human Health journey, is to "do something of purpose and make art and do science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. This drive has always included wanting to do something meaningful for many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. While acknowledging a potential ego component, she believes ego can be used for good, as it represents the "self" that can be applied in many ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

Georgia finds a flow state in product design, viewing it as art and a means to express herself and help others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. This deep connection between personal history, resilience, and mission makes Human Health a natural extension of its founders' beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. She has learned to "surrender to the outcome" of the company, focusing instead on her desire for the product to exist for the world, which allows her to be more creative and less stressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>.# Founders' Motivations and Personal Histories: The Story of Human Health

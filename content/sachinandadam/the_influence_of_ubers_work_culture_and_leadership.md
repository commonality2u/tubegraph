Mina Radhakrishnan, Uber's first Head of Product in 2011, offers unique insights into the company's early work culture and the profound [[leadership_lessons_and_company_building_in_the_tech_industry | leadership lessons]] she gained while working closely with Travis Kalanick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Her experiences at Uber, which started with only 20 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, shaped her perspective on building companies and leading teams, eventually influencing her decision to become a founder herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.

## The "How Can You Do It?" Mindset

A significant learning from her time at Uber, especially from working with Travis Kalanick, was the prevailing mindset of "you don't ask the question, 'can you do it?' you ask the question, 'how can you do it?'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. This approach fostered a "yes first" policy, meaning the initial response was never "no," but rather an exploration of possibilities, even for challenging concepts like "random cars off the street" or "surge pricing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. This culture encouraged thorough exploration before dismissing an idea, pushing teams to understand "what could we do to try and do that? How would we make it happen?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

## Working with Travis Kalanick: Intensity and Learning

Travis Kalanick is described as incredibly intense and highly charismatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. Radhakrishnan shares anecdotes illustrating both the demanding and impactful aspects of his leadership:

> "I was running some experiment and it wasn't thoroughly baked frankly it was partly my fault too. I just hadn't like really thought it through. I hadn't like pulled the stuff and I was trying to I was presenting and it was very early days and I was presenting the numbers at our at our all hands and it it like in the middle of the meeting I was like 'this is dumb. Like you don't know how to do math and you got to go figure out like what it is.' and it was like god that was very unpleasant and that wasn't fun to do. But he was right. He was right." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>

Conversely, she recalls a moment of validation for her "golden ticket" experiment:

> "I remember like walking into the office and like Travis is like p he has this thing paces the office right he has this thing that he does and he was like 'who did this golden ticket thing?' and I was like 'oh I'm gonna get fired like this.' I put my hand out I was like 'hey Travis' has Mike he's like 'I love it this is so great.'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>

Despite the challenges, working with Kalanick pushed her and other employees to be better, tougher, and harder, contributing to personal and professional growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

## Balancing Intensity and Culture

The intense pace at Uber inevitably led to burnout for some, as it's challenging to maintain a [[building_company_culture_and_founder_mindset | culture of speed]] while preserving "the humanness of a culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. Radhakrishnan acknowledges that early-stage companies, especially those growing rapidly like Uber, require hard pushes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. The balance is not about constant 100% intensity, but knowing when to push hard and when to allow for recovery time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. This approach is key for [[developing_a_company_culture_during_rapid_growth | developing a company culture]] that can sustain rapid growth without completely burning out its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

For instance, [[emil_michaels_career_at_uber | Emil Michael]], also an Uber alumnus, reportedly prolonged having a family to dedicate himself to building Uber's intense culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

## Uber's Lasting Impact on the Tech World

Uber has left a significant legacy on the tech world. It is noted for producing a high percentage of Product Managers who went on to become founders, making it one of the top companies in raw numbers for creating founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. Radhakrishnan views her time at Uber as a pivotal moment that solidified her desire to be a founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. The shift in her career path, from large companies like Goldman Sachs and Google to progressively smaller startups, eventually led her to Uber, a 20-person company that proved to be "crazy" and pivotal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

Her parents' perception of Uber also evolved from skepticism about a "black car company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a> to acknowledging its prominence after it gained widespread media attention, including mentions by celebrities like Ashton Kutcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

Overall, Radhakrishnan emphasizes that the decisions made in her career were driven by "what drives me, like what is it that I think is interesting? Where am I going to find joy in work? What do I think is going to be interesting to do? and where do I think it's going to move forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, rather than chasing status or external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

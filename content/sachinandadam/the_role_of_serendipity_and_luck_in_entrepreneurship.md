Paul Bassat, a prominent figure in the startup and venture capital industry, shares insights into how [[the_significance_of_luck_and_serendipity_in_professional_success | luck]] and [[the_significance_of_luck_and_serendipity_in_professional_success | serendipity]] have significantly shaped his [[entrepreneurial_journey_and_mindset | entrepreneurial journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. His career path, from a lawyer to co-founding Seek and later Square Peg Capital, was largely unplanned and driven by an openness to change and opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## An Unplanned Career Path

Bassat initially pursued a conventional life, growing up in Melbourne and studying law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. He describes himself as an "accidental lawyer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, having worked in law for six years before his career took a "less obvious direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a> with the founding of Seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This shift marked the beginning of his involvement with technology, startups, and disruptive innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Despite his significant achievements, Bassat explicitly states that "not much in my career has been planned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. He notes that his decision to study law was influenced by getting good marks in his final year of high school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, leading him down a seemingly predetermined path.

## The Role of Serendipity and Luck

Bassat considers himself "incredibly lucky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, attributing his good fortune to factors like being born in Melbourne, Australia, having supportive parents and siblings, receiving a good education, and maintaining good health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. He sees [[the_significance_of_luck_and_serendipity_in_professional_success | serendipity]] as a word that "resonates a lot" with him, acknowledging its similarity yet distinctness from [[the_significance_of_luck_and_serendipity_in_professional_success | luck]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### Increasing the Surface Area of Your Life

A core philosophy for Bassat is "doing things in your life to increase the surface area of your life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This means actively creating conditions where [[the_significance_of_luck_and_serendipity_in_professional_success | serendipity]] can occur. This concept aligns with "engineered serendipity," where one is "in the arena" and exposing themselves to the chance of [[the_significance_of_luck_and_serendipity_in_professional_success | luck]] striking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Being Prepared to Take Opportunities

A crucial element to harnessing [[the_significance_of_luck_and_serendipity_in_professional_success | luck]] and [[the_significance_of_luck_and_serendipity_in_professional_success | serendipity]] is being prepared to "take those opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This involves:
*   **Openness to change** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
*   **Enjoying ambiguity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>
*   **Being outside one's comfort zone** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
*   **Working with driven, smart, motivated, high-integrity people** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
*   **Enjoying building things** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>

### Overcoming the Fear of Looking Stupid

Bassat identifies the "fear of looking stupid" as a common barrier that prevents people from pursuing ventures like starting or joining a startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. He redefines [[entrepreneurship_and_risk_management_strategies | failure]] not as trying something and it not working out, but as "not being prepared to show up and not having a crack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This mindset is vital for embracing [[the_significance_of_luck_and_serendipity_in_professional_success | opportunities]] as they arise.

## Early Entrepreneurial Indications

While Bassat wasn't the stereotypical child entrepreneur with a lemonade stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, he did engage in one entrepreneurial activity at university: organizing concerts to pay for a holiday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. More significantly, he recalls moments from his childhood and early adulthood that indicated a nascent entrepreneurial mindset:
*   Visiting Disneyland as a child and thinking about Walt Disney, the person who "built disneyland," rather than just enjoying the rides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   During a BridgeClimb in his early 20s, analyzing the business model, considering the number of people on the bridge, and estimating gross margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

These anecdotes highlight an underlying curiosity and inclination towards building and understanding business models, even if the path to entrepreneurship wasn't consciously mapped out from a young age. His journey underscores that success often comes from a combination of [[the_significance_of_luck_and_serendipity_in_professional_success | luck]], an openness to [[the_significance_of_luck_and_serendipity_in_professional_success | serendipitous]] moments, and a willingness to seize opportunities.

Canva, valued at nearly $40 billion, is one of the largest private tech companies globally and a significant [[canvas_founding_and_growth_journey | Australian tech success story]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While widely used as consumer software by amateur and professional designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, a key aspect of its continued exponential growth and future strategy involves a strategic push into the enterprise market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Strategic Shift to Enterprise Sales

Canva's move "Upstream" into [[enterprise_sales_and_customer_engagement | Enterprise Sales]] is identified as a crucial factor in its enduring success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Large organizations now provide Canva access to thousands of their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Features for Organizations
To cater to larger organizations, Canva has developed specific features:
*   Collaboration tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
*   Brand kits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
*   Administrative controls to protect data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>

### Revenue Diversification and Maximization
This shift into the enterprise space has multiple benefits:
*   **Diversified Revenue** By moving beyond individual consumers, Canva has diversified its revenue streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Increased Revenue** The enterprise push has directly contributed to increased overall revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **IPO Strategy** With a rumored IPO in late 2025, the push into enterprise is a clear strategy to maximize their IPO price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Companies with enterprise revenue are typically valued more highly than those relying solely on consumer revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Sticky Revenue** Enterprise clients often provide more stable and "sticky" revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Building a Creative Toolkit** The move aims to build a more comprehensive enterprise creative toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

Canva's "Create days" events frequently highlight their focus on enterprise, indicating it as a major future direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This strategic pivot ensures that Canva does not solely rely on individual consumers, aiming to become an enduring generational company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This aggressive strategy could potentially allow Canva to become as large as companies like Microsoft and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

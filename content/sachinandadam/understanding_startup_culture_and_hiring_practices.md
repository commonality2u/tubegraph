Jack Zang, founder and CEO of Airwallex, an $8 billion technology company, offers insights into building a high-performance startup culture and effective hiring practices.

## Core Elements of Startup Culture

### Passion and Work Ethic
A significant aspect of [[Developing a startups company culture and team dynamics | startup culture]] is being passionate and interested in the work, to the point where it doesn't feel like "work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Jack Zang himself works "100-hour weeks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> and finds work more interesting than leisure activities like watching Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>. This dedication often involves significant personal sacrifices, including social life and even health checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>. While this intensity built resilience, Zang states he wouldn't wish the same level of hardship on his own children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

### Embracing Mistakes and Risk-Taking
A key part of Airwallex's [[Developing a startups company culture and team dynamics | culture]] is the acceptance of mistakes, learning from them, and improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This implicitly requires being comfortable with taking risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

However, Zang differentiates between types of mistakes:
*   **Acceptable Mistakes**: These come from employees who "cared and tried" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>, are intelligent, smart, and genuinely curious about solving problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>. These individuals should be encouraged to try again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.
*   **Unacceptable Mistakes**: These result from carelessness, lack of effort, or genuine lack of curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. Such individuals should be terminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Mission-Driven Focus
For Zang, the primary motivation for building Airwallex has shifted from a "trillion-dollar company" goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a> to a deep-seated mission: "empowering entrepreneurs globally to operate anywhere, any time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. The desire is to build critical infrastructure to ease the challenges faced by entrepreneurs, including dealing with large institutions and cross-border operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Hearing personal stories from customers whose lives were transformed by Airwallex reinforces this mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. This mission-driven approach is a significant source of motivation and commitment, even influencing decisions like declining acquisition offers to maintain control of the company's destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

## Startup Culture and Environment in Australia

Jack Zang notes differences in the [[Differences between Australian and Silicon Valley startup cultures | startup culture]] between Australia and the US:
*   **Risk-Taking Attitude**: Australia is perceived as less risk-taking, with a tendency to criticize mistakes rather than foster learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.
*   **Ecosystem Maturity**: The tech ecosystem in Melbourne, where Airwallex started, was initially "quite weak" compared to Sydney, which has more successful tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.
*   **Social Welfare Impact**: The robust social welfare system in Australia, providing a safety net and reducing financial pressure, may inadvertently make it "harder to build grit" in individuals compared to environments like the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.
*   **Government Role**: Zang suggests that government incentives, like those seen in Singapore or China, could play a more significant role in fostering innovation and a long-term vision for the country's technological future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>.

## Identifying and Hiring Talent in Startups

[[Identifying and Hiring Talent in Startups | Building a high-performance culture]] at Airwallex involves:
*   **Shared Beliefs**: Attracting and retaining individuals who share similar thinking and believe in the company's mission and vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.
*   **High Standards**: Setting a high bar for recruitment and continuously increasing it year after year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>.
*   **Persistence**: Despite recruitment challenges, the response to HR leaders reporting low achievement rates is "try harder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>, as Zang believes there are enough ambitious and mission-driven people available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

### Key Qualities to Look For
Zang advises early-stage founders on [[Identifying and Hiring Talent in Startups | hiring excellent people]]:
*   **Personality**: Often "overrated" in its importance, personality is crucial but challenging to assess in interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.
*   **Raw Intelligence**: This is fundamental for problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.
*   **General Curiosity**: A desire to understand and explore is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.

### Interviewing Techniques
To identify these qualities, Zang recommends a dynamic interviewing approach:
*   **Deep Drilling**: Instead of a fixed set of questions, interviewers should ask about achievements and then continuously "drill down" into the answers to understand details, problem-solving approaches, curiosity, confidence, and technical competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>.
*   **Assessing Response to Difficulty**: Observe if candidates get annoyed when asked about things they don't understand or if they show curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.
*   **Transparency about Failures**: Ask about failures and assess their transparency and openness to improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.

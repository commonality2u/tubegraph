Modern tech companies are increasingly recognizing the pivotal role of media and effective distribution in their growth and success. This involves not just marketing their products, but actively building a public profile, fostering community, and leveraging various platforms to reach their target audience.

## The Role of Media in Startup Growth

The podcast hosts, Sashin and Adam, have been [[building_a_tech_media_company | building a company]] "behind the scenes of the media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This strategic choice underscores their belief in the power of media as a foundational element for a tech venture. Their team has grown from two or three people to thirteen, with an aim to share their journey more openly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Key aspects of their media strategy include:
*   **Creative and Strategic Direction** Tom, who joined the team in January, is responsible for growing the YouTube channel and directing it creatively and strategically, with the goal of creating the highest quality tech media in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. His role includes managing microphones, cameras, and lighting, and increasingly taking over media operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This has allowed co-founder Adam to focus on other areas of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Audience Engagement and Growth Targets** The team aims to hit 15,000 subscribers by the end of the year as part of their mission to create the best tech media in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. They emphasize that subscribing is the best way for the audience to support the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. As a thank you for support, a special surprise is planned for the end of the year, including a potential tech founder summit if they reach their subscriber goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.
*   **Media as a Core Business Function** For the founders, media is an important bet. They believe that as the world moves towards AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), distribution becomes even more critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. Their media efforts are where their customers come from, where their brand is built, and where trust is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. They believe they can build the best tech media channel in their region, if not globally, with sufficient effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. While the media team might become a smaller percentage of the total headcount as the company grows, the culture of technology and creativity will remain central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

## Distribution in the AI Era

The conversation highlights how tech companies, especially in the AI space, are adapting their [[role_of_data_and_technology_in_media_and_entertainment | distribution strategies]].
*   **Shift to Application Layer** OpenAI's recent moves, such as partnering with Johnny Ive's Hardware IO and acquiring Wind Surf, indicate a push towards becoming a general consumer [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technology]] company. The goal is to be the next Apple, controlling the entire stack with AI at its core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Sam Altman's discussions about AI super apps and assistants also point to a clear move into the application layer, which could disrupt many existing startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   **Brand Moat and User Habits** While models may commoditize, brand awareness and user familiarity can create a significant "brand moat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. Users tend to stick with interfaces and designs they are accustomed to, such as ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. The analogy of "getting an Uber" (vs. "getting a rideshare") applies to "Chatting GBT" (vs. "Gemini" or "Claude") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Bundled Distribution** Companies like Google leverage their existing ecosystem for seamless distribution. Gemini's AI summaries appear automatically when users search, and AI note summaries are integrated into Google Meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. This bundled approach allows them to integrate AI features easily without explicit user action.

## The Intersection of Technology and Creativity

The discussions also touch upon the increasing emphasis on "high taste designers" in startups, partly due to the decreasing cost of creation with AI tools. As the execution part of creation becomes easier (e.g., creating a movie in minutes through prompting), the "taste of the idea" and choosing the best idea become the crucial differentiators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. This highlights a convergence of art and [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technology]], which has always existed but is gaining more prominence in the tech discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. The podcast team believes in the importance of combining [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technology]] with creativity as a core cultural aspect, regardless of the business division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.

Comtech, founded by David Shein, holds the distinction of being Australia's first unicorn startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The company was a networking business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> and was eventually sold for $1.1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This significant achievement occurred during a period when the technology industry was not yet prominent in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The company was sold in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>, with David Shein departing in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

## Founding and Market Context

David Shein identified a market gap in the early 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. At that time, personal computers (PCs) were not widely adopted; they were typically used by accountants for budgeting or by executive assistants for word processing, rather than being on every desktop or in every household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

Shein began by putting small businesses onto computer systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. He observed a growing demand for networked PCs, a burgeoning area known as local area networking, which connected multiple PCs within an office environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Recognizing this trend, Shein decided to start Comtech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

Comtech became the second distributor in Australia for Novell, which was considered the hottest networking company globally at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Despite 27 companies applying for the distributorship, Shein's "hustle" helped secure the partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Business Strategy and Success Factors

Comtech's success was largely attributed to its commitment to exceptional customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> and a "sales-led model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

### Overcoming Competition
Initially, Comtech faced competition from an incumbent distributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Within three months, Novell appointed two additional distributors, meaning Comtech was one of four companies selling the identical Novell product in the Australian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Despite this, Comtech consistently retained 70% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

### Legendary Customer Service
This dominance was achieved by prioritizing customer satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Comtech's approach included:
*   **Delivering on Promises**: Never making commitments to customers that they couldn't fulfill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Problem Solving**: When issues arose, the focus was on fixing the problem rather than assigning blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. David Shein believed that Comtech's business was "built on problems and our ability to solve those problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   **Investment in People**: Shein realized that investing in employees leads to exceptional service for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### Talent Acquisition
David Shein's ability to identify and hire talent was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. He admits not being a natural technologist but possessed a strong "gut" feeling for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. His philosophy was to "hire for attitude, train for skills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. He often hired individuals who might not have traditional qualifications, such as university degrees, but demonstrated exceptional attitude and ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, such as Scott Petty and Dave Colvin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

## Life After Comtech
Despite the immense financial success from the sale of Comtech, David Shein initially felt unfulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>. He gained financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a> but lacked purpose, feeling "debilitating" with nothing to do and unable to add value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. He recognized he "didn't plan for my life after Comtech" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

This led him to seek opportunities where he could contribute and make a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. This realization defined his career path from 2001 until he co-founded OIF in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

## OIF and [[Investing in Australian tech startups | Investing in Australian Tech Startups]]

David Shein co-founded OIF with Jeff Levy in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. This venture was driven by his desire to be part of the growing [[innovation_in_australian_technology | innovation in Australian technology]] and [[the_evolution_and_impact_of_the_australian_tech_ecosystem | Australian tech ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>, learning from his regret of not engaging more with the internet's early impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. The fund was also influenced by Malcolm Turnbull's government making tax policy changes to encourage high-net-worth individuals to [[investment_strategies_in_unicorn_startups | invest in startups]] and early-stage venture capital funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>.

### OIF's Thesis: The Three F's
OIF's core philosophy is built on "three F's" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>:
1.  **Founder**: OIF is 120% committed to its founders, viewing them as customers. They aim to add value beyond just providing capital, which they see as a commodity in the current ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
2.  **Fund**: OIF is a fund entrusted by its investors to deliver returns. It exclusively has high-net-worth individuals as investors, without institutional money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. They prioritize happy founders over maximizing returns to the detriment of the founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>.
3.  **Fun**: The "third f is we're a fund without a d," meaning they only work with people they genuinely want to collaborate with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.

### Investment Focus and Philosophy
OIF does not have a specific industry thematic; instead, its "thematic is Founders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>. They believe founders will lead them to fast-growing industries, such as climate change, where they anticipate future investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. Investment decisions are primarily "founder-led," with due diligence following the assessment of the founder themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.

### Key Qualities in Founders
When evaluating founders, David Shein looks for several critical qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>:
*   **Ability to Energize People**: Founders must be able to convince and motivate employees, customers, and partners to join their vision, especially in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.
*   **High Energy**: Founders need significant energy to navigate challenges like pandemics, talent shortages, and fluctuating capital markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **The "Edge" to Make Tough Decisions**: This includes being willing to let go of underperforming staff or products, or making bold strategic choices like expanding internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.
*   **Ability to Execute**: Sincere belief that the founder can execute on the business plan they present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>.

Shein believes that founders who successfully navigate challenging macroeconomic environments will emerge with greater resilience and a better chance of building "generational companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.

### OIF's Legacy and Future
OIF aims to maintain a legacy where "Founders love us and our investors say the best thing we did was we entrusted our Capital to... OIF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>. This approach has led to significant success, such as raising $100 million for a fund within 24 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>, following an investment in Instacluster that returned $70 million from a $37 million fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. Shein asserts that as long as founders are satisfied and investors receive strong returns, OIF will continue to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.

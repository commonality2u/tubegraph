Maxine Minter is recognized as Australia's first female solo General Partner (GP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Described as incredibly driven, passionate, and sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, she has established Coventures, a $10 million pre-seed fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Her announcement as Australia's first female solo GP garnered significant attention on LinkedIn, making waves in the Australian ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## Driving Purpose: Accelerating People
Minter's career journey, which includes roles as an executive coach, venture capitalist, angel investor, founder, and lawyer, is connected by a core purpose: a love for accelerating and boosting people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This motivation has evolved over time; initially, it was about proving what was possible for herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. However, in the last three to four years, she has found much greater joy in accelerating others and watching them flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. She finds immense satisfaction in seeing the "sparkle in the eye" or the "aha moment" when someone grasps a concept or develops an idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

This deep joy was first noticed during her time as a lawyer, helping junior lawyers navigate their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. It continued through her experiences in angel investing, building teams, and helping co-founders accelerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. Becoming an executive coach intensified this purpose, and building a fund has further amplified it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

## [[maxines_early_background_and_experiences_in_the_early_united_states | Early Background and Intellectual Curiosity]]
As a child, Minter was "obsessed with how stuff works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>, reading books about how bricks, concrete, and building materials were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. This early curiosity marked a deep interest in understanding fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. However, in her teens, she "did a hard pivot... away from anything intellectual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>, spending time at the beach focused on fun and boys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. She didn't enjoy school, even being in the bottom of her class for English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

A catalyst in Year 10 (around age 15-16) prompted a desire to excel academically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:09]</a>. She stopped drinking for two years to focus, falling in love with the intellectual pursuit and the feeling of mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. This period instilled a "dopamine" rush from deep learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. This intellectual stimulation is rooted in understanding "how something works at its brass tax" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>, exemplified by her reading the Australian Constitution cover-to-cover before law school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.

Minter believes that early social experiences, even those not directly intellectual, helped her develop emotional intelligence and rounded her out, providing diverse perspectives from people from all walks of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. She particularly credits a teacher, Mrs. Hickey, with giving her "permission to... enjoy intellectual stimulation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.

## Legal Career and Transition
Maxine Minter spent almost a decade in law, starting as a paralegal at Clayton Utz during her first year of law school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>. She initially aimed to be a criminal barrister, influenced by *Law and Order*, but found the reality "extremely emotionally complex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.

She chose law due to its structured and plannable nature, in rejection of the less structured entrepreneurial path of her mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>. The term "startup" or "entrepreneur" wasn't part of her vocabulary until she went to Stanford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>, and she had no idea what venture capital (VC) was even when introduced to Sam Wong, then a principal at Blackbird, before leaving Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>.

She loved the law for its intellectual stimulation and structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>. A key mentor was Dan Friedman, an IBM deal guy, from whom she learned a great deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:26]</a>. Her decision to leave law came when she no longer felt the "dopamine of learning" or intellectual stretching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>.

### The Bondi Hill Moment
A "Bondi Hill" moment was an "unfreezing moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a> where she realized she was bored and not learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>. While sitting on the hill, she reflected on what brought her deep joy: getting lost for hours in a spreadsheet, planning and modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:00">[20:51:00]</a>, contrasting this with the boredom of reviewing a Master Services Agreement (MSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>. This was a realization that she could generate value doing what she loved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>.

## Stanford and the US Tech Ecosystem
Minter chose Stanford for its interdisciplinary work, intending to study business and computer science to understand the future of law and bring insights back to Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>. At Stanford's Graduate School of Business (GSB), she felt "so much more at home" due to the pace of new ideas and dynamism of the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:00">[23:01:00]</a>. Unlike the rigid legal field where intellectual curiosity isn't always celebrated, the GSB's startup ecosystem fully embraces it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:00">[23:16:00]</a>.

A pivotal moment was taking a course called "Entrepreneurship from Diverse Perspectives" taught by Fern Mendelbaum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. This course exposed her to entrepreneurs who didn't fit the standard mold, helping her recognize her own mother's entrepreneurial spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>. This experience highlighted the contrast between Australia, which she perceived as having a "race to the middle" and a "tall poppy syndrome" where conformity is valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>, and the US, which celebrates outlier behavior and individualism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:22:00">[25:22:00]</a>.

## Executive Coaching Expertise
Minter's experience as an executive coach is deeply rooted in the US mindset of striving to be "the top of your field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:25:00">[29:25:00]</a>. In the US, executive coaches are seen as "performance adjacent," similar to how elite athletes have coaches to improve their game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:43:00">[29:43:00]</a>. When she returned to Australia in 2020, she noted that coaches were often seen as "therapy adjacent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:12:00">[30:12:00]</a>, though this is now shifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:22:00">[30:22:00]</a>.

Key learnings from her coaching work include:
*   **Performance Uplift**: A coach helps identify areas for improvement and applies frameworks for performance uplift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00:00">[30:00:00]</a>.
*   **Leadership Impact**: Leadership is measured not by intention, but by what the team hears and does with the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>.
*   **Collaboration over Competition**: Minter learned that while competition can be motivating, collaboration is a more sustainably powerful place to build motivation and generate outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>. This concept is so central that it inspired the "Co" in "Coventures" and "Collab" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>.
*   **Interpersonal Dynamics**: A significant portion of coaching focuses on soft skills and interpersonal dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>. Executives often need to learn how to influence others to get the most out of their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:20:00">[35:20:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Awareness and Personal Performance**: Coaches help executives understand their own psychology of performance, identifying their strengths and learning to lean into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:36:00">[35:36:00]</a>.
*   **Co-founder Dynamics**: This is a particularly challenging area where coaches provide significant support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:49:00">[35:49:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Focus**: Founders often need help strategizing what to focus on first among many disparate problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:05:00">[36:05:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Linear Human Development**: Human development is not linear or even exponential; it's a "wiggly loop" of plateaus and unlocks. Founders must invest in their personal development to keep pace with their company's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:10:00">[37:10:00]</a>.

Minter notes that Alex, the founder of Linktree, has an "incredible ability to learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:05:00">[38:05:00]</a>, combining low ego with the capacity to lead a high-performance team. He demonstrates a "beginner's mindset" in high-stakes environments, absorbing information and learning rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:39:00">[38:39:00]</a>.

## Transition to Venture Capital
Minter's move into angel investing and venture capital was a natural progression. Having been trained in analytical thinking through law and subjects like math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:57:00">[42:57:00]</a>, she finds rational thought comfortable. She has "trained herself to love emotional engagement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>, now finding immense joy in both analytical problem-solving and connecting with people on an emotional level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:04:00">[44:04:00]</a>.

### Investing Philosophy: Grit and Growth Mindset
At the pre-seed stage, investing is a combination of analytical and emotional engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:50:00">[43:50:00]</a>. Minter seeks "grit and growth mindset" in founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:53:00">[44:53:00]</a>. She assesses this through:
*   **Narrative Inquiry**: Asking about past experiences to understand their life journey and how they've overcome hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:33:00">[45:33:00]</a>.
*   **Diligence**: Speaking to people who know the founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:44:00">[45:44:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Reported Mindset**: Evaluating their self-perception, looking for self-awareness in their responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:50:00">[45:50:00]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability**: A crucial indicator is the ability to be vulnerable and admit "I don't know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:40:00">[47:40:00]</a>, as this demonstrates a mindset conducive to fast learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:48:00">[47:48:00]</a>.

### Coventures: A Pre-Seed Opportunity
Minter started Coventures due to a "huge opportunity" in the Australian market to specialize in the pre-seed stage, akin to what First Round Capital did for seed investing in the Bay Area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:32:00">[48:32:00]</a>. She identified a "huge commercial opportunity" coupled with a "huge impact opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:55:00">[48:55:00]</a>. If successful, Coventures will accelerate the next generation of Australian unicorns, creating career, wealth, and life opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:02:00">[49:02:00]</a>.

The startup ecosystem, which was not even part of her vocabulary when she left Australia in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:47:00">[49:47:00]</a>, is now the sixth-largest employer in Australia, indicating incredible growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:52:00">[49:52:00]</a>.

A conversation with a good friend, Sarah McNaught, about whether an Australian woman had ever raised a fund by herself, and the lack of reference points for solo GPs in Australia, inspired Minter to fill this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:31:00">[50:31:00]</a>.

#### Winning Strategy and Competitive Edge
Minter believes "good strategy wins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:01:00">[52:01:00]</a>, which involves a differentiated customer insight supported by a superior financial model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:10:00">[52:10:00]</a>. The "Open Secret" is the difficulty of raising pre-seed in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:23:00">[52:23:00]</a>, evidenced by the uncorrelated valuation changes between pre-seed and seed rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:37:00">[52:37:00]</a>. Australia's ecosystem is "very underfunded," with 1/17th the amount invested per GDP compared to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:07:00">[53:07:00]</a>.

Coventures' thesis is to find companies in Australia and accelerate them to the US, leveraging a "stage Arbitrage" (focusing solely on pre-seed) and an "ecosystem Arbitrage" (bridging the Australian and US markets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:18:00">[53:18:00]</a>. Minter notes that no one is investing in pre-seed in Australia "institutionally properly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:51:00">[54:51:00]</a> in the same thoughtful way the US ecosystem does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:45:00">[54:45:00]</a>. This represents an opportunity that opened up as earlier-stage US funds grew and began writing larger seed checks, creating a gap for a new, earlier investment class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:06:00">[55:06:00]</a>.

## Personal Management and Work-Life Harmony
To manage her demanding life, Minter applies disciplines learned as a lawyer, like measuring her life in six-minute increments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:19:00">[56:19:00]</a>. She religiously tracks her time using tools like Sunsama, which helps plan and close out her day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:27:00">[56:27:00]</a>.

Her key strategies include:
*   **Highest Leverage Work**: Constantly asking herself if she's working on the highest leverage task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:53:00">[56:53:00]</a>.
*   **Joy Auditing**: Daily reflection on what brought her joy and what sapped her energy, aiming to maximize joy-inducing activities to work longer and feel better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:57:00">[56:57:00]</a>.
*   **Hard Trade-offs**: Making decisions to not do certain things, leverage others' time, or reprioritize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:20:00">[57:20:00]</a>.
*   **Continued Coaching**: She still works with an executive coach to navigate overwhelm and strategize effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:44:00">[57:44:00]</a>.
*   **Time and Energy Management**: Crucial for sustained performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:01:00">[59:01:00]</a>.
*   **Work-Life Harmony**: Prioritizing activities that nourish her and allow for "cross-training" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:14:00">[59:14:00]</a>, such as advisory work, sitting on the Stanford Australia Association committee, and engaging with people from diverse ages, stages, and industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:43:00">[59:43:00]</a>. She emphasizes avoiding becoming "siled in Tech" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>.
*   **Connected Time**: Deliberately scheduling time with her partner, family, and friends, recognizing that these "important but not urgent" activities are often deprioritized without conscious effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.

Minter lives by the principle of "not making decisions that you don't have to make" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:27">[01:11:27]</a>, freeing up cognitive load for high-leverage decisions. An example is her commitment to her life partner, Marcus, whom she fell in love with in the first week and proposed to three months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. This decision was based on how she wanted to *feel* in the partnership, rather than external frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>.

## Final Reflections
Minter emphasizes that to be the best at what you do, you cannot be stressed all the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>. Making decisions in a state of "fight or flight" leads to poor outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. While "hustle culture" can promote constant stress, coaches help individuals pause and reflect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>.

She advocates for understanding one's unique "work like a lion" rhythm, balancing sprints with rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>, and valuing rest for increased creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:58">[01:04:58]</a>. The key is to run experiments and compound on insights to find what truly brings "joyful work" and "true work-life harmony" for the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>.

What keeps her up at night are small, unfulfilled commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>. She uses breathwork to manage her energy and sometimes embraces early morning wakefulness as a time for curious thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>.

Minter deeply misses the Australian sky, sunsets, natural environment, and the genuine depth of connection with people that focuses on who you are, not just your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:54">[01:14:54]</a>.

Innovation, particularly within the realm of technology, is considered critically important for Australia's future success, driving productivity and competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. A key element of innovation is having the right attitude: being prepared to approach a problem differently tomorrow than it was handled today, rather than assuming traditional methods are always best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This involves a "growth mindset" and a willingness to "tinker and tweak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Malcolm Turnbull's Contribution to Australian Tech
Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who served for nearly three years, played a significant role in fostering [[australias_role_and_culture_in_technological_innovation | innovation in Australia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. While not a technologist himself, he had a reputation for technological knowledge in Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> and was driven by a fascination with newness and a desire to optimize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

His government's **National Innovation and Science Agenda (NISA)**, launched in 2015, comprised approximately 24 measures aimed at stimulating the tech sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Key initiatives included:
*   Tax incentives for [[investing_in_australian_tech_startups | investors in startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   The establishment of new innovation funds, such as the Medical Research Fund and what became known as [[investing_in_australian_tech_startups | Main Sequence Ventures]] (the CSIRO fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

These reforms had a substantial impact, leading to a significant increase in venture capital availability in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Historically, Australian tech companies like Ozemail had to seek public funding in the United States due to a lack of available capital domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This has now changed, with many young people eager to work for or build startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

## Cultural and Political Challenges to Innovation
One of the major weaknesses in Australian politics regarding innovation is **risk aversion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. There's a reluctance to admit when something isn't working, unlike the tech sector where smart entrepreneurs are prepared to "fail fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Turnbull emphasized the importance of setting expectations that not all initiatives will succeed, and that learning from failures is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. He likened it to professional investors who view entrepreneurs who have experienced "wipeouts" as having learned a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. The culture in places like Silicon Valley embraces failure as a learning opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

Government departments also tend to be risk-averse, preferring to deal with large, established companies rather than smaller, early-stage startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. Startups value government contracts as a form of validation and a source of valuable feedback, more so than mere grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. This applies particularly to the defense sector, which often prefers to buy foreign technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

## Promoting Australian Technological Sovereignty
Turnbull highlighted the importance of Australian sovereignty and industry, advocating for the design, construction, and maintenance of technology within Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. He pushed for agreements like the frigate program to ensure Australian entities gain control and experience in ship building, rather than just being customers for foreign goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. An example of a successful Australian technology company is **Advanced Navigation**, which developed world-leading inertial navigation technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.

## The Role of Media and Narrative
There is a perceived failure in Australia to adequately promote its own tech sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. While organizations like the Australian Technology Council are working to highlight the sector's growth in jobs and capital, a broader narrative shift is needed to counter the perception of Australia primarily as a mining nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. The media has a significant role in shaping this narrative and fostering a positive perception of Australian technological capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

## Future Focus for [[the_future_of_technology_and_innovation_in_australia | Australian Tech]]
For [[australias_path_to_becoming_a_tech_superpower | Australia to succeed]] further in technology, the focus should be on:
*   **Continued support for Australian technology and industry** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.
*   **The clean energy transition**, with Australia having the means to become a zero-emission country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.
*   **Maintaining national unity** in Australia's highly multicultural society, resisting divisive forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.

The most important thing for innovation remains attitude: being prepared to tackle problems differently and not being afraid of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. Young people, in particular, are often better at this due to less ingrained experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.

Kirsten Hunter, CEO and co-founder of Future Super, is featured in episode 54 of the Satchel and Adam Show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Her career path, which includes studying arts, law, and science at UNSW, working at a top consultancy like Bain, and starting her own venture, is seen as an inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Genesis of Future Super

Future Super was founded six years ago by Simon and Adam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Their [[founders_motivations_and_personal_histories | motivations]] stemmed from a political background, having run for politics in the Tony Abbott election with a passion to prevent the repeal of carbon trading legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. After losing the election, they sought another way to influence Australia's state of play, realizing that "money drives decisions" in a capitalist society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

They identified superannuation as a powerful tool for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Australia's superannuation pool, valued at three trillion dollars, is the world's third or fourth largest pool of investable assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Uniquely, this money is owned by individuals who can decide where it is invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The decisions made today about superannuation investment will influence the world retirees live in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Kirsten's Role as a Co-Founder

Kirsten joined Future Super two years after its inception, serving as a "late-stage co-founder" â€“ a less common occurrence in Australia's startup ecosystem but more prevalent in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. When she joined, the company had fewer than 10 people working in a single office in Canberra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

Kirsten was drawn to the potential for Future Super to not only be an amazing super fund that aligns with people's values but also to change the conversation on a macro scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Her driving force was the idea of wielding the power of money to demonstrate that a better path is possible, thereby influencing larger super funds and other companies to become more ethical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. She focused on how Future Super could develop policies that other companies could follow, seeing their work as an "experimental sort of progressive working paradise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

## Mission and Theory of Change

Future Super's purpose is "to build a prosperous future free from climate change and inequality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This dual focus highlights the deep connection between capitalism, climate change, and inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. Climate change itself drives inequality, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

The company's theory of change posits that redirecting superannuation investments can influence the broader financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. By showing that ethical investments are viable and beneficial, Future Super aims to encourage larger players like Hesta, UniSuper, and AustralianSuper to adopt more ethical practices, such as divesting from fossil fuels and implementing negative screening for industries like armaments and old-growth logging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Addressing Inequality: Focus on Gender

Kirsten is deeply passionate about the role of women, gender equality, and justice for women, an area that became even more prominent after she had her child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. A significant issue in the superannuation industry is that women retire with 47% less superannuation than men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:55">[00:35:55]</a>. This disparity is seen as an accumulation of career-long injustices, including the gender pay gap, lack of promotion to senior roles, and time taken out for caring responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

To address this, Future Super, though a small entity, introduced three key superannuation policies for its own staff:
*   **Higher Super Rate for Lower Earners**: Any staff member earning under $80,000 per annum would receive a higher rate of superannuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.
*   **Superannuation During Parental Leave**: Staff taking parental leave would receive superannuation payments for the full first 12 months, which is usually not the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.
*   **Full-Time Equivalent Super for Part-Time Carers**: Part-time workers who are also carers would have their super paid as though they were working full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.

These policies were gender-neutral but disproportionately benefited women who tended to be in those roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>. Kirsten observed other companies begin to offer similar policies in their job advertisements, which was a significant win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

Future Super also undertook work analyzing the gender pay gap in the ASX 200, discovering that many companies do not even examine or disclose their own gender pay gap data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>. Internally, a question from a team member about Future Super's own gender pay gap on Equal Pay Day led to a multi-year change [[building_company_culture_and_founder_mindset | journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. After a capital raising, they reset remuneration and reduced their internal gender pay gap from 20% to less than 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.

While overt discrimination in pay for the same job is rare, unconscious biases still exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. These biases manifest in areas like performance and promotion, where men are often promoted with less criteria met or apply for roles with only 60% of qualifications, while women wait until they meet 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>. Discretionary bonuses can also be a source of imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>. Kirsten advocates for targets and quotas in organizations, especially where diversity imbalances persist, and believes leaders' remuneration should be tied to meeting diversity rankings, as "if it isn't measured, it doesn't matter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>.

## Vision for a Better Economic System

Kirsten envisions a "utopia" where capitalism is no longer broken and rewards good behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>. She seeks a world where profit does not come at the expense of people or the planet, and where profitability is closely linked to positive impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. This includes punishing behavior that damages the planet or creates inequality through taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

She believes a new economic system is possible, driven by the younger generation as consumers and employees who are increasingly choosing ethically manufactured, fair trade products and services, even if they come with slightly higher costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>. This shift is seen as an exciting development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

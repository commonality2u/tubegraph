The journey to success, particularly in leadership roles, is profoundly influenced by the quality of one's [[the_impact_of_mentors_on_personal_and_professional_growth | mentors]] and the strength of their [[networking_and_relationships_in_career_success | professional networks]]. Adam, the CEO of Deloitte Australia, emphasizes that these relationships are critical for personal growth, career progression, and ultimately, building a meaningful legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.

## The Indispensable Role of Mentors
Adam reflects on his early career, highlighting that he was initially a "rough diamond" and would likely not have been recruited today due to his "larrikin" nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. However, he credits individuals who took a "pun" on him and became his [[the_impact_of_mentors_on_personal_and_professional_growth | mentors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Mentors are described as critical individuals who:
*   **Invest in potential**: They "saw something in this rough diamond" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> and recognized potential that the individual might not have seen in themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Provide experiences and feedback**: Mentors "went out of their way to look after me and give me experiences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a> and offered guidance on behavior, helping to cultivate beneficial traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Aid in self-improvement**: By listening to [[the_impact_of_mentors_on_personal_and_professional_growth | mentors]], individuals can become "a better person, a better professional, a better leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   **Help realize potential**: Their guidance is instrumental in helping individuals "realize my potential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

It is advised to have "multiple [[the_impact_of_mentors_on_personal_and_professional_growth | mentors]] from different parts of your life" to bounce ideas off and receive varied feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

## The Power of Networks
Adam asserts that "success in life and career comes down to how good how strong your [[networking_and_relationships_in_career_success | network]] is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. He emphasizes that building and investing in one's [[networking_and_relationships_in_career_success | network]] was the "number one thing" he did in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This approach allows the "universe [to] open up" with new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

Key aspects of effective [[networking_and_relationships_in_career_success | networking]]:
*   **Opportunity creation**: Rather than rigid career planning, building a strong [[networking_and_relationships_in_career_success | network]] and learning new things naturally creates opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Internal organizational [[networking_and_relationships_in_career_success | networks]]**: Within large organizations like Deloitte, individuals can have multiple careers by taking different roles. This allows them to leverage their "fantastic [[networking_and_relationships_in_career_success | network]] globally" without constantly changing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. Changing jobs too frequently can set a person back by two or three years because they have to rebuild their [[networking_and_relationships_in_career_success | networks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
*   **Long-term connections**: It's crucial to "maintain contact" with peers, as people develop and "end up doing interesting stuff" in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.

## Authenticity in Relationships
Adam stresses that [[building_and_nurturing_personal_and_professional_relationships | relationships]] must be "natural" and "authentic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. He advises against being "transactional" in [[building_and_nurturing_personal_and_professional_relationships | relationships]], noting that those in leadership positions can "spot someone who's transactional in a relationship in about four seconds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>.

To foster genuine connections:
*   **Treat everyone equally**: He highlights treating the "car park operator and the CEO exactly the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>, as everyone has value and can be important contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
*   **"Give to get"**: It's important to "give into relationships" without expecting immediate returns, as "over time the universe absolutely comes and supports you if you've been giving into those relationships" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.
*   **Show genuine interest**: "Show interest in the person, not the role that they have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.

## Practical Advice for Future Leaders
For those embarking on their careers, Adam offers several pieces of [[networking_and_career_advice_for_university_students | career advice]]:
*   **Take opportunities**: Embrace every opportunity, even if it seems mundane, and be curious about the "why" behind tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. Every action is a chance to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.
*   **Continuous learning**: Remain intensely curious, always challenging oneself and learning new things, whether through formal education like an MBA or by staying informed on current topics like climate change or indigenous history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Embrace failures**: "The people who succeed the most have failed the most" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>; view tough projects and situations as opportunities to learn and grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Self-awareness**: Regularly ask "How am I perceived?" to understand how others view you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. This feedback, especially from those at various levels of interaction, helps manage weaknesses and leverage strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.
*   **Adaptability**: Life inevitably disrupts plans, making adaptability the "number one characteristic of people that succeed long term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. Be prepared to assess and seize unexpected opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

Ultimately, Adam believes the greatest source of pride and legacy in his professional life is "the people that I've helped [[the_impact_of_mentors_on_personal_and_professional_growth | mentor]] and watch them grow through their careers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

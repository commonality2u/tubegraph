Alex Honnold, a world-renowned climber featured in the film *Free Solo*, has expanded his focus beyond extreme sports to become an advisor in the nature-tech and [[Combating Climate Change through Investment | climate investing]] space. He advises Regen Ventures, an Australian venture capital fund focused on climate solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Transition to Climate Advocacy

Honnold's journey into the climate sector is a natural extension of his passion for climbing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. His career as a rock climber means he spends significant time outdoors, fostering a deep appreciation for nature and the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This connection inspired his involvement in environmental work, including reading environmental non-fiction and actively engaging with founders who are developing innovative solutions to climate problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Honnold Foundation's Global Solar Projects

A core part of Honnold's climate engagement is his work through the Honnold Foundation, which actively supports solar projects around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. He describes himself as personally passionate about solar energy and the broader energy transition towards renewables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Collaboration with Regen Ventures

As an advisor to Regen Ventures, Honnold is drawn to the fund's core mission of "regeneration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. He finds it inspiring to work with a company dedicated to actively supporting initiatives that improve the world, prioritizing positive impact over solely financial gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. He believes that ideally, every company should strive to be [[systems_change_and_market_incentives_for_green_practices | regenerative]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Broader Climate Solutions

While his primary focus remains solar and the energy transition, Honnold expresses admiration for other founders and their dedication to niche climate solutions. He appreciates learning about diverse areas, such as [[naturebased_solutions_for_climate_change | seagrass]] conservation, even if they are not his personal area of expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Ongoing Commitment

Honnold views his involvement with the Honnold Foundation's work and Regen Ventures as sufficient to "fill his cup" in terms of climate participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. His main priority continues to be his climbing career and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

The Sachin Adam Show is actively [[building_a_tech_media_company | building a tech media company]] that encompasses three core aspects: business, media, and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. This integrated approach aims to set the foundation for their long-term work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Defining the Mission

Initially, the co-hosts engaged in "soul searching" to define the purpose and niche of their podcast among many others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. They redefined their mission to be "the home for future business leaders" who want to utilize their skills and capital to create positive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. The overarching theme is learning from inspirational individuals and using business for good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

The show embodies an "education angle," focused on learning from influential people and sharing those insights to help others improve themselves and use business for greater impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This includes conversations with venture capitalists (VCs) and entrepreneurs, as well as figures in politics or psychology, all contributing to a growth mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## Content and Channels

The media brand extends beyond the podcast:
*   **Podcast** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>: Features interviews with leaders from around the world, unpacking their failures, successes, and passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.
*   **Booklet/PDF** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>: In collaboration with Textbook Ventures, a booklet is being written to explain entrepreneurship, venture capital, and angel investing for university students, incorporating snippets from their podcast interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Angel Investing Memos** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>: They plan to release their writings on how they assess investments, including deal memos, to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.
*   **Social Media** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>: Content is shared on platforms like TikTok and Twitter, and they also share articles and blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **Content for Schools** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>: They have an opportunity to create educational content specifically for school students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

The aim is to democratize information, especially regarding the tech and venture capital industries in Australia, which often have a high barrier to entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## The "Build in Public" Philosophy

The co-hosts embrace a "build in public" approach, openly sharing their process and learnings rather than concealing their efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. This transparency allows for feedback, stress-testing of their ideas, and a deeper conversation around their ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:10]</a>.

They believe in "chasing curiosities and stitching up the narrative in retrospect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>, acknowledging that successful journeys often appear linear only when viewed in hindsight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. This approach allows them to learn from mistakes and share those insights with their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

## Learning and Community

The development of the media brand is closely tied to their personal learning journey, particularly through online communities:
*   **Discord and Slack Channels** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>: They participate in communities like "Early Work" and "Next Chapter," which bring together entrepreneurs, investors, and university students to discuss ideas and provide accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Peer Learning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>: These communities foster an environment where people learn from each other by sharing work, debating ideas, and engaging in intense discussions, which they consider the best way to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.
*   **Accountability Groups** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>: Communities help overcome the lack of accountability often found in online education, with members proposing to complete courses or read articles together and then review them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:39:19]</a>. They note that they have learned more from these communities than from aspects of their university degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:11]</a>.

The co-hosts believe that engagement and participation in these communities could become a strong "signal" of knowledge, potentially rivaling traditional university degrees in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:34]</a>.

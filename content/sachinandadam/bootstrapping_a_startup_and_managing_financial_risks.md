The journey of a startup is rarely a straight path, and for founders like Faruk Ismail, co-founder of Slice (formerly PayatTravel), navigating the early stages involves significant financial risk and a deep understanding of market conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### The Genesis: Identifying a Problem and Building Conviction
Faruk and his co-founder Yanik started PayatTravel in 2018 while working at CBA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24">[02:24]</a>. They identified a significant market problem: families were using high-interest debt like credit cards to fund essential travel, often to visit family for cultural events or holidays, leading to post-trip financial burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31">[02:31]</a>. Their mission became to offer a layby service for flights, allowing customers to secure prices and pay weekly or fortnightly before travel, providing an alternative to debt and credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06">[03:06]</a>. This mission remains central to their operation, with customer testimonials serving as a powerful source of satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19">[03:19]</a>.

Instead of immediately seeking external funding, they adopted a "half-in, half-out" approach to [[launching_a_startup | launching their startup]], starting it on the side to test the waters and build conviction at a small scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25">[04:25]</a>.

Their Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was a simple WordPress landing page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45">[04:45]</a>. It lacked automation and real-time flight data; customers would fill out a form, and a hired individual in the Philippines would manually send a quote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51">[04:51]</a>. If interested, Faruk would personally call to process bookings and collect card details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06">[05:06]</a>. This hands-on approach, combined with self-taught Facebook marketing, allowed them to get initial inquiries and paying customers, which built their conviction that there was a genuine demand for their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15">[05:15]</a>.

### [[bootstrapping_a_tech_company | Bootstrapping Strategies]] and Financial Sacrifice
To fund their operations without external capital, Faruk and Yanik employed several [[bootstrapping_a_tech_company | bootstrapping]] strategies:
*   **Personal Savings**: They pooled their personal savings to cover initial marketing and ticket purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22">[11:22]</a>.
*   **Personal Credit Cards**: They personally took out credit cards to fund additional expenses, including tickets and marketing, operating with a high level of conviction based on close monitoring of customer acquisition costs, payback periods, and average losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34">[11:34]</a>. This meant they were constantly "maxing themselves out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01">[12:01]</a>.
*   **Friends and Family Loans**: Once their personal capital was depleted, they secured loans from friends and family, paying them interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33">[12:33]</a>. This added stress due to the responsibility of not losing other people's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39">[12:39]</a>.
*   **Personally Guaranteed Debt**: Much of the initial funding was personally guaranteed, meaning they were at risk of personal bankruptcy if the business failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06">[13:06]</a>.

Faruk made significant personal sacrifices, quitting his well-paying job at CBA to pay himself just $400 a week (around $20,000 a year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04">[06:04]</a>. He later sold his car to inject more capital into the business, and Yanik refinanced his house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53">[15:53]</a>.

### Navigating Crisis: The COVID-19 Challenge
The ultimate test of their [[entrepreneurship_and_risk_management_strategies | risk management strategy]] and resilience came with the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31">[13:31]</a>. As a flight-only business operating out of Australia, 95% of their revenue "evaporated" overnight due to border closures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37">[13:37]</a>.

During this crisis, they focused on what they *could* control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06">[14:06]</a>:
*   **Customer Care**: Ensuring customers received refunds or airline credits was paramount to preserve their brand reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08">[14:08]</a>.
*   **Strategic Expansion**: While surviving on government support (JobKeeper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32">[14:32]</a>, they recognized the need for a bold move. Observing robust flight activity in the US compared to Australia, they decided to expand into the US market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02">[15:02]</a>. This decision was made with the mindset of "going down swinging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05">[16:05]</a>. They launched in the US within four weeks, and within three months, their revenue returned to pre-COVID levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33">[15:33]</a>.

### Lessons from Bootstrapping and Crisis Management
Faruk highlights several key takeaways from their [[bootstrapping_a_tech_company | bootstrapping]] and crisis experience:
*   **Constraints Foster Discipline**: Operating without external funding forced them to understand their metrics deeply (customer acquisition cost, customer lifetime value) and be incredibly disciplined with spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15">[16:15]</a>.
*   **Conviction from Product-Market Fit**: Early validation of their product-market fit gave them the conviction to make high-stakes decisions and endure hardships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38">[16:38]</a>.
*   **Prepare Before Crisis**: The best way to navigate a crisis is to prepare for it *before* it happens, building an "arsenal of tools" and studying how others have endured hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26">[17:26]</a>. Stoicism, with its emphasis on focusing on what you can control, was a key philosophical tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55">[18:55]</a>.
*   **Embrace Risk Judiciously**: Faruk enjoys risk, viewing it as associated with reward when done smartly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08">[25:08]</a>. It's about analyzing risk from multiple perspectives (e.g., risk of omission vs. risk of commission) and different time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15">[21:15]</a>.

### Balancing Risk: "Pirate Mode"
As the company grew, Faruk evolved his [[entrepreneurship_and_risk_management_strategies | risk management strategy]]. He differentiates between:
*   **"Mothership" (Established Business)**: For their PayatTravel B2C business, they allocate roughly 70% of resources to "upside creation" (growth initiatives) and 30% to "downside protection" (mitigating risks, ensuring compliance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08">[23:08]</a>.
*   **"Pirate Mode" (New Ventures)**: For new products or market expansions (like Slice Bay), they operate in "pirate mode," dedicating 90% to upside creation and 10% to "downside protection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:18">[23:18]</a>. This involves being extremely aggressive, prioritizing speed, validation, and even "cutting corners" (within the 10% safety net) to achieve quick wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:03">[43:03]</a>.

This approach ensures that the large, established part of the business doesn't slow down innovative, high-growth exploration projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37">[23:37]</a>.

### Transitioning to Venture Capital
After years of [[bootstrapping_a_tech_company | bootstrapping]], Slice raised a significant $17.5 million seed round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:45">[29:45]</a>. This required Faruk to refine his ability to package and articulate Slice's story, vision, and mission to external investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:36">[30:36]</a>. He learned that finding the "right" investor means finding one who understands the business, resonates with the mission, has conviction, and moves quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31">[31:31]</a>.

A key learning from this process was the importance of creating optionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04">[33:04]</a>. By building a business with global potential (operating in Australia and the US), they broadened their investor landscape beyond just Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19">[33:19]</a>. Their ability to be self-sustaining (not *needing* to raise capital) provided significant leverage during fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:08">[33:08]</a>.

Investors like Peak 15 gained conviction in Faruk and Yanik due to their resilience through adversity, particularly surviving the COVID-19 crisis, and their complementary skill sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:05">[35:05]</a>.

### Evolving as a Founder and Scaling Culture
As Slice grows to an 80-person team (20 in Australia), Faruk's focus shifts to [[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_culture | scaling the company's culture]] and maintaining its aggressive, risk-on DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:02">[39:02]</a>. He wants to remain a hands-on founder, ensuring that the initial principles and decision-making frameworks are instilled throughout the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04">[40:04]</a>.

One proactive strategy is to document principles and decision-making processes in a shared platform like Notion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:38">[43:38]</a>. This allows future employees, even when the company is much larger, to consult written guidelines and understand the founders' intent, reducing reliance on constant meetings and allowing for more efficient "upside creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:15">[44:15]</a>.

Faruk stresses that running a startup is 90% pain and 10% happiness, and it's not for those who seek balance or safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03">[28:03]</a>. However, he believes "going all in" can trigger creativity and resourcefulness, ultimately increasing the chances of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:14">[28:14]</a>.

### Recommended Reading for Founders Navigating Hardship
Faruk recommends the following resources to develop a stoic mindset and prepare for entrepreneurial challenges:
*   **Philosophy (Stoicism)**:
    *   *A Guide to the Good Life* (as an introduction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:14">[47:14]</a>
    *   Works by Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:19">[47:19]</a> (Seneca is his personal favorite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:28">[47:28]</a>).
*   **Hardship Literature**:
    *   *Man's Search for Meaning* by Viktor Frankl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:51">[47:51]</a>
    *   *Endurance* by Alfred Lansing (about Shackleton's expedition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:09">[48:09]</a>
    *   Classical literature by authors like Dostoevsky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:13">[48:13]</a>.

These books, he states, "knock you out" and "rewire your thinking" by exposing readers to profound resilience and suffering, putting entrepreneurial struggles into perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:17">[48:17]</a>. The key is to prepare oneself when things are good, rather than trying to figure things out in the midst of a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:35">[48:35]</a>.

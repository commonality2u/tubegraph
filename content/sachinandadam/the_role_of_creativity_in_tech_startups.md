Creativity plays a fundamental role in the success and differentiation of tech startups, especially in a rapidly evolving landscape driven by AI. Far from being an exclusive trait, creativity is seen as an inherent human ability that, when combined with technical prowess, can lead to groundbreaking innovations.

## Defining Creativity in Tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>

Sam Krenberg, co-founder of Cutible, believes that creativity is not limited to those explicitly labeled as "creative" but is a universal human trait. He argues that everyone possesses the ability to create content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The key differentiator lies in the technical ability to bring an idea to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This perspective highlights that a "creative" idea needs technical execution to become a tangible product or service.

## Creativity as a Differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>

Sam's previous venture, A Cloud Guru, succeeded not merely due to its scalable platform, but because of the [[importance_of_creativity_and_risktaking | creative]] element embedded in its training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Injecting personality and building a compelling narrative were intangible factors that set it apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This experience directly informed his view that creativity is a key differentiator, even in seemingly disparate fields like tech training and advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

In the context of Cutible, the goal is to leverage AI to "bring back the golden age of advertising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> by making ads enjoyable again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This involves a focus on quality and craft over mere quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. While AI can ease the creation process, the "craft still wins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, implying that human aesthetic judgment and storytelling remain paramount.

## The Human Element in an AI-Driven World <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>

A core thesis at Cutible is that as AI models improve, human creativity becomes even *more* important and higher leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. The cost of creation trends towards zero, making the creative human the ultimate winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

Key arguments for the enduring [[importance_of_creativity_and_risktaking | human role]] in a creative field include:
*   **Authentic Connection:** AI-generated content, despite looking real, lacks the "nothing to connect to" factor because there's no actual person with a backstory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. Humans innately crave recognition and appreciation from other humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
*   **Value of Craft:** When the camera was invented, painting didn't die; "better paintings are cared for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Similarly, print didn't kill originals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. AI doesn't kill design; it changes the tools and allows more people to enter the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. The craft will rise to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   **Risk and Intuition:** AI cannot "feel risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>, which is appreciated by audiences in bold creative endeavors (e.g., a film shot in one take) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Creative processes are often non-linear and rely on intuition, which is hard to replicate with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.
*   **Quality over Quantity:** While AI can generate massive quantities of content, the internet is "filled with terrible ads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. The true challenge is creating quality and quantity simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. Good ads resonate with the audience, are a good concept, and ideally become entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.

## Integrating Creativity and Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>

[[challenges_and_strategies_in_startup_culture | Merging]] the worlds of advertising and engineering is "not easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a> due to different ways of thinking and working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>. Advertising professionals often use interchangeable terminology, while engineers require precise definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. Engineers tend to see things in discrete parts, whereas creative individuals view everything as interconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>.

To bridge this gap, Cutible encourages a collaborative and experimental approach:
*   **Prototyping:** Advertising and agency teams often prototype new approaches themselves using custom GPTs or external models to test ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>.
*   **Rapid Feedback:** There's rapid sharing between creative and engineering teams, analyzing what worked and comparing it to the system's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>.
*   **Open-minded Talent:** The company seeks engineers who are open-minded and comfortable with uncertainty, as they are "searching around trying to work out" solutions in a new field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>. Creative recruits must be willing to systematize their work rather than solely relying on intuition, documenting their process to make it repeatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The "not happy Jan" ad, one of Australia's most famous, featured an improvised line, highlighting moments of human spontaneity that are difficult for AI to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. AI can learn from what it has seen, but true improvisation and pushing the state-of-the-art remain open questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

## Future of Creative AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>

The biggest unsolved problem in creative AI, according to Sam, is enabling AI to reliably recognize a good idea or ad, similar to how a human can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. If AI could achieve this, the approach could shift from creating the "perfect ad every time" to generating thousands and identifying the best ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. This indicates a potential future where AI provides quantity, and a discerning AI (or human) identifies quality.

Ultimately, the goal is to produce "good ideas, good creative entertainment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>. Jack recalls a time when people discussed funny ads, a phenomenon that has largely disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>, underscoring the desire to restore the positive impact of advertising through enhanced creativity.

The core mission is to ensure that everyone in the world has access to a [[worldclass_tech_education_access | worldclass tech education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This mission is pursued through two primary methods: initially creating educational content and subsequently enabling [[emerging_middle_class_in_asia_and_tech_economy | tech creators across Asia]] to produce their own content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### The Vision
The foundation of this initiative stems from experience in [[tech_media_in_australia_and_asia_pacific | Tech media]], specifically with the "Sachin Adam show" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This experience led to the idea of creating great [[tech_media_in_australia_and_asia_pacific | Tech media]] for Australia and the Asia Pacific region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Approach to Education and Content
A strong belief underpins this approach: "Talent is evenly distributed but opportunity isn't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Recognizing that technology is poised to be the world's driving force, the goal is to provide content that enables [[emerging_middle_class_in_asia_and_tech_economy | emerging middle class populations in Asia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Impact on the Emerging Tech Economy
Success is defined by empowering these populations with content, allowing them to achieve their aspirations, find inspiration, and acquire the necessary tools to participate in the new [[emerging_middle_class_in_asia_and_tech_economy | tech economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This initiative aims to foster growth and innovation within these regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

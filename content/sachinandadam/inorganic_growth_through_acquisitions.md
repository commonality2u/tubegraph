[[Atlassians growth strategy | Atlassian]] has successfully leveraged inorganic growth, primarily through acquisitions, as a key component of its overall [[rapid_company_growth_and_expansion_strategies | growth strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This approach involves acquiring other companies rather than relying solely on internal development to expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Atlassian's Acquisition Philosophy
While 70% to 90% of all acquisitions reportedly fail to generate shareholder value, [[Atlassians growth strategy | Atlassian]] has navigated the acquisition landscape exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Their impressive set of acquisitions has consistently contributed to their mission of serving global teams in collaboration and communication, strengthening their product offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

This success is attributed to the founders, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, deeply understanding the cycle of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. They recognize that innovators often emerge to challenge incumbents, building better products at a lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Having started as disruptors themselves, replacing manual service tickets when no software existed for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, [[Atlassians growth strategy | Atlassian]] anticipates new competitors will constantly try to build superior versions of their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

To build an enduring product "moat," the company does not shy away from acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. They understand that young, scrappy founders will always challenge their core products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Examples of Strategic Acquisitions
A notable example of [[Atlassians growth strategy | Atlassian]]'s inorganic growth strategy is their recent acquisition of Loom for nearly a billion US dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. [[Atlassians growth strategy | Atlassian]] identified Loom's growth early and integrated it into their suite of workplace collaboration tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Lessons for Founders
For founders, [[Atlassians growth strategy | Atlassian]]'s journey highlights the importance of inorganic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Waiting for a product to become obsolete due to younger founders innovating on it is a detrimental strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. [[Atlassians growth strategy | Atlassian]] has demonstrated smart use of inorganic growth strategies to establish a lasting competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Even for those without a background in M&A or private equity, considering acquisitions as a key method for [[rapid_growth_strategies_for_startups | startup growth]] is valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Their brilliant execution of inorganic growth has been crucial in building an enduring business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

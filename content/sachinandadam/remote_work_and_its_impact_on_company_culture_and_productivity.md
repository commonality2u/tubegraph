Ben Thompson, CEO and founder of Employment Hero, a billion-dollar Australian software company specializing in HR and payroll solutions, has a unique perspective on the impact of remote work on company culture and productivity, especially after navigating a tough macroeconomic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

## Navigating the Macro Environment with Strong Unit Economics

Employment Hero maintained strong performance and unit economics during a period of market turmoil in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Their focus on tight unit economics, instilled from their Series A and B rounds, positioned them well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. A tight employment market, characterized by low unemployment (around 3.6-3.7%), resulted in exceptional net revenue retention and strong growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. The company pivoted to assist clients with recruitment, addressing their primary challenge of finding people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## Personal and Company Philosophy on Remote Work

Ben Thompson operates from home due to family reasons, including caring for a child with special needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. He attributes his ability to work "ridiculous hours" to loving his work, which aligns with his passion for helping businesses employ more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. This personal experience heavily influences Employment Hero's remote-first approach.

Employment Hero's "Master Plan Part Two," written at the start of COVID-19, focused on sustaining remote work globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. Thompson views remote work as "fundamentally different and better" and worth preserving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:19">[07:17:19]</a>.

### Benefits of Remote Work

*   **Flexibility for Diverse Groups**: It provides essential flexibility for:
    *   Working parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:27">[07:27:27]</a>
    *   Individuals with disabilities who may struggle with commuting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>
    *   Pet carers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>
*   **Geographic Accessibility**: Empowers individuals in rural communities, like Armidale, to access high-powered, high-paid jobs typically concentrated in major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:07">[08:07:07]</a>.
*   **Global Inclusion**: Satellite internet systems like Starlink are connecting billions of people in developing countries to the internet, opening up the world of work and education, enabling them to earn more and contribute constructively to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:30">[08:29:30]</a>. This social good is paramount to Thompson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

### Critiques of Forcing Return to Office

Thompson strongly criticizes mandatory office returns for knowledge workers, stating it is "not very intelligent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

*   **Limited Talent Pool**: Forcing a return to the office, even hybrid, restricts recruitment to a small geographic radius (e.g., 25-50 kilometers from a city like Sydney or Melbourne) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:06">[10:06:06]</a>. A remote-first approach allows recruitment from anywhere, with time zones being the only limitation, significantly expanding the talent pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.
*   **Flawed Creativity Argument**: The idea that "serendipitous moments" or group brainstorming in an office lead to great ideas is disputed. Thompson believes most great ideas originate from a single person having time for "intense thought" and understanding concepts from first principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:54">[10:53:54]</a>. Solitude, rather than office interaction, can foster this creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.
*   **Hybrid is the "Worst of Both Worlds"**: Thompson views hybrid models as inefficient, predicting most companies will unfortunately end up there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:49">[11:48:49]</a>.

## Building and Managing a Global Remote Workforce

Expanding a business internationally and managing a global workforce presents significant [[Challenges of working in consulting | challenges]] and complexities, especially concerning legal and cultural differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.

### Challenges of Global Employment

*   **Legal & Regulatory Differences**: Even within Australia, employing across state borders means navigating different public holidays, long service leave laws, and workers' compensation regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>. Internationally, differences in termination and redundancy laws (e.g., New Zealand vs. Australia) add complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.
*   **Time Zones**: Coordinating work across diverse time zones is a constant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>.
*   **Language & Cultural Barriers**: [[Impact of cultural differences on work productivity | Cultural differences]] and language difficulties require thoughtful solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>.

### Employment Hero's "Global Teams" Solution

To address these complexities, Employment Hero developed "Global Teams," a platform designed to help SMEs [[Expanding a business internationally and managing a global workforce | build a global workforce]] with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.

*   **Legal Compliance**: Establishes employment entities in various countries and integrates legal minimum entitlements into the platform, ensuring compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>.
*   **Integrated Services**: Provides payroll and recruitment services worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>.
*   **HR Platform**: Offers a comprehensive HR platform for managing employees, including one-on-ones, performance reviews, and HR/pay files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>.
*   **Talent Portal**: Acts as a portal to global talent, connected to approximately 1,500 different job boards and LinkedIn, allowing users to post jobs and onboard employees from almost any country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: The goal is to make employing someone anywhere on Earth as easy as employing someone in a local town, with onboarding taking as little as eight minutes remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>.

For startups, this means easy access to virtual assistants, bookkeepers, designers, and engineers from places like the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, and Indonesia, which are often more accessible and cost-effective than local capital cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. This allows founders to focus on their core competencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:00">[30:29:00]</a>.

## Developing a Remote-First Company Culture

Employment Hero grew from 180 employees in February 2020 to 825, with the vast majority recruited remotely, establishing a remote-first culture from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>.

### Key Strategies for Culture and Productivity

*   **Asynchronous Communication**: Emphasizing asynchronous communication (e.g., recorded videos, audio messages) allows employees to respond when it makes sense for them, often leading to more considered responses than synchronous meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:16:00">[22:16:00]</a>.
*   **Clear OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**: Clear OKRs, combined with trust and autonomy for employees to achieve difficult, independent tasks aligned with company goals, are crucial for remote-first work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06:00">[23:06:00]</a>.
*   **Technological Solutions**: Language barriers are decreasing with real-time transcription tools that translate meetings into multiple languages on the fly, akin to the "Babel Fish" from *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:49:00">[23:49:00]</a>.
*   **Global Diversity**: A globally diverse workforce (different cultures, religions, races, languages, genders) naturally creates a diverse and inclusive environment, negating the need for separate local diversity initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:33:00">[24:33:00]</a>.
*   **Deliberate Social Connection**: To preserve the social aspect of work, Employment Hero organizes an annual "Global Gathering" (e.g., Thailand, Vietnam), offering a five-day, all-expenses-paid trip for all 800+ employees. This deliberate effort to foster camaraderie and teamwork is believed to build stronger relationships in five days than a year of in-office work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:00">[25:52:00]</a>.

## The Future Vision for Employment Hero

Ben Thompson envisions Employment Hero becoming the world's largest platform for managing human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:00">[30:50:00]</a>. He views traditional "point solutions" (recruitment, onboarding, HR, payroll as separate software-as-a-service offerings) as merely "tools" to achieve a single goal: "talented labor working productively in your business as fast as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:23:00">[27:23:00]</a>.

### New Products and Vision

*   **Swag (Consumer App)**: Employment Hero's first consumer app, Swag, aims to leverage the platform's considerable buying power ($75 billion in salaries managed annually across 1 million+ people, representing 15% of Australia's private sector workforce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:00">[33:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Instapay**: Provides real-time access to earned wages, moving towards a future where employees are paid hourly as they work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:34:00">[34:34:00]</a>.
    *   **Value Proposition for Employees**: Offers discounts and aims to create a strong value proposition for candidates and employees, attracting talent to solve employers' biggest problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:57:00">[35:57:00]</a>.
    *   **Employment Super App**: Swag seeks to be a single app for finding work, managing work, getting paid, and managing spending and savings. It automatically updates an employee's CV based on hours worked and roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:12:00">[36:12:00]</a>.
*   **International Expansion**: Aggressive expansion into markets like the UK is planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:29:00">[37:29:00]</a>.
*   **AI Integration**: Employment Hero is actively developing and releasing AI features, with more advanced "Horizon 2" and "Horizon 3" features planned for future release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:57:00">[37:57:00]</a>.

Ultimately, in five years, Employment Hero aims to be recognized not just as an HR platform but as the primary source of productive, skilled talent that powers businesses, with its tools supercharging employee performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48:00">[29:48:00]</a>. This vision focuses on taking care of all the non-unique tasks, allowing businesses to focus on their core strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:25:00">[30:25:00]</a>.

Rex Woodbury, a partner at Index Ventures and author of "Digital Native," delves into the intricate relationship between [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technology]] and human behavior, offering a unique perspective on consumer trends, generational shifts, and the future of digital interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. His work is driven by a core interest in how people interact with content, culture, and each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

## Personal Drivers and Insights
Woodbury's personal journey highlights the blend of creative and analytical interests that define his approach to [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technology]] and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. Influenced by his father, a doctor who was also a "renaissance man" with a passion for filmmaking, writing, and reading, Woodbury developed an early love for film and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. His interest in how human behavior manifests itself in data, such as box office numbers, bestseller lists, and music charts, laid the groundwork for his career in venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. He believes that [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technology]] is the story of our time, and entrepreneurship serves as a mechanism for social and cultural change at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

He identifies as primarily a left-brain oriented person, with a strong interest in literature and English, preferring interaction and building rapport over solely analytical tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. This perspective informs his view that while he was trained in a "right brain" way through investment banking and later-stage investing, his true passion lies in the human and cultural aspects of [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

## New York: A Metaphor for the Internet
Woodbury famously describes New York City as a metaphor for the internet, emphasizing the shared qualities of wildness, chaos, and diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. He finds energy in the city's "collision of humanity," where interesting characters and quirkiness thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. This mirrors the internet's ability to serve as a haven for "outcasts" or those who didn't belong elsewhere, allowing individuals to find their communities, or "tribes," on platforms like Reddit, Discord, and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This connection to finding belonging is a significant draw for him, both in the physical city and the digital age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## [[Generation Zs relationship with technology | Gen Z]] and the Digital Age
Woodbury highlights [[Generation Zs relationship with technology | Gen Z]] as the first truly "digitally native generation," having come of age with smartphones and social media as integral parts of their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. He acknowledges ongoing discussions about the impact of smartphones and social media on mental health, recognizing a strong correlation between their adoption and worsening mental health among teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. However, he maintains a "perpetual Tech Optimist" stance, drawing parallels to historical anxieties surrounding new [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technologies]] like TV or the printing press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.

He believes that while negative externalities exist, the net impact of [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technology]] is positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

> "I think that you can look through every Tech era of the past and you know people were always saying you know TV rots your mind, the internet runs your mind. I mean, you know, even the printing press was viewed as probably propagating bad ideas and making people lazy by eroding human memory. I mean there's just a long history of backlash to new [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technologies]] and anxiety has always progressed up into the right." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>

He cites examples like the growth of Worthy, an LGBTQ+ mentorship organization that leveraged Instagram for global reach and community building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. He also echoes Jack Conte of Patreon, who notes that the internet's global scale allows individuals with niche interests to find belonging, alleviating loneliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

While acknowledging rising mental health rates and loneliness, Woodbury suggests that these issues stem more from "certain product decisions around social media" and their addictive properties rather than [[technology_and_its_role_in_society | technology]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. He posits that the next wave of consumer apps, like BeReal, might focus on inspiring more authentic connections, potentially bridging online and offline interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. He believes that policy and regulation may be necessary to curb the excesses of ad-driven business models that incentivize prolonged digital engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.

## [[the_future_of_social_media_and_digital_interaction | The Future of Social Media and Digital Interaction]]
A major shift in online attention is away from broad interactions with friends and acquaintances (social media 1.0) towards meeting strangers and forming parasocial relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Platforms like TikTok, Discord, and Reddit facilitate connections based on shared interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.

Woodbury anticipates that the next social network will likely resemble a game, such as Minecraft or Roblox, blurring the lines between creation and play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. He also notes the rise of the Creator Economy, which he broadly defines as "digitally native work" or "job creation platforms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. This trend empowers individuals to dictate their own lives and earn a living in diverse ways online, such as being a TikToker, YouTuber, live-stream seller, or Roblox developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. This phenomenon represents an inspiring alternative to traditional corporate structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.

## Venture Investing in Consumer Behavior
Woodbury's investment philosophy in the consumer space is broad, encompassing human behavior and including B2B and B2B2C models, not exclusively direct-to-consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>. He highlights investments in areas like infrastructure for creator storefronts and e-commerce enablement that embed [[social_impact_and_innovation_in_emerging_technologies | social impact]] into the checkout experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. These capitalize on trends like [[Generation Zs relationship with technology | Gen Z's]] desire to align values with shopping, while still being B2B in their monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.

He emphasizes a "change mindset" rather than a purely "thesis-driven" approach to investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. This involves:
*   Having a pulse on major "tectonic shifts" in the economy and human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
*   Being "entrepreneur-led," recognizing that exceptional entrepreneurs often live years into the future and possess unique insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>.

He identifies three key qualities in the best entrepreneurs:
1.  **Founder-Market Fit**: An "unfair advantage" stemming from a lived experience that informs their understanding of a pain point or opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Examples include a gamer building a gaming company or an Instagram employee understanding Creator Commerce problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>.
2.  **Clarity of Thought**: The ability to understand the order of operations and how to build a large company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
3.  **Unique Insight**: A fresh perspective or a way of viewing the world that the investor hadn't considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.

Woodbury also cautions against biases in the venture world, including those against minority or female investors, and biases derived from past experiences (e.g., dismissing a new idea because a similar one failed before) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. He advocates for an "Eyes Wide Open" approach to pattern recognition, acknowledging that exciting businesses and entrepreneurs can emerge from non-conventional backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. This highlights the [[the_intersection_of_art_and_science_in_venture_investing | intersection of art and science in venture investing]], where intuition and analytical rigor must balance.

## Reflection on Learning
A crucial lesson Woodbury learned "too late in life" but wishes he had internalized earlier is the importance of following one's passions and interests, allowing them to guide career choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>. While he acknowledges the value of hard work and intelligence in various fields, he emphasizes finding areas where one can be "world-class" and true to oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>. He encourages young people to deeply consider the kind of life and career they aspire to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>.

The issue of [[gender_equality_in_australia_and_globally | gender equality]] extends beyond Western nations, presenting unique challenges for women in various parts of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56"></a>.

## Impact of Stereotypes and Social Norms
In many countries, women are seen as needing protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39"></a>. This often translates into deeply embedded stereotypes and social norms that limit women's autonomy and rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31"></a>. For example, in some countries, women cannot leave their homes without the permission of a male guardian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46"></a>. Furthermore, a woman's testimony in certain legal systems may be valued less than a man's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58"></a>. These norms are often built into the laws and structures of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07"></a>.

## Rise of Fundamentalism and Extremism
The rise of fundamentalist religions and extremism is identified as a leading cause of backlash against women's rights globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02"></a>. Extreme forms of Islam, Catholicism, and Pentecostalism are cited as influences that seek to revert men and women to traditional roles, a situation described as retrogressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16"></a>.

## Economic and Social Vulnerabilities
Women in non-Western nations often face significant economic and social vulnerabilities:
*   **Informal Economy Employment** Many women are employed in the informal economy, such as street vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:40"></a>. Lockdowns, as seen during the [[impact_of_covid19_on_gender_equality | COVID-19 pandemic]], can severely impact their ability to earn income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47"></a>.
*   **Repression of Entrepreneurship** In one instance, women who attempted to become digital entrepreneurs by selling clothes online were arrested and incarcerated for "damaging the morality of the nation," forced to read out confessions on their Facebook pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54"></a>.
*   **Limited Access to Careers** A paradox exists where some countries, less gender-equal than Australia, have higher numbers of women in engineering and STEM fields, but often for different reasons than in Western nations, such as a desire for purpose over salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:18"></a>. However, if the organizational culture doesn't align with their purpose, women are less likely to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25"></a>.

## Gendered Impact of Global Crises (e.g., COVID-19)
The [[impact_of_covid19_on_gender_equality | COVID-19 pandemic]] has had a distinctly gendered impact globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58"></a>:
*   **Increased Domestic Violence** There has been a significant increase in domestic and family violence, with reports of a 300% uplift in Hubei Province (Wuhan) alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19"></a>. For nearly a billion women already living in or recently experiencing physical violence in an intimate relationship, home becomes the least safe place due to quarantine and lockdown provisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34"></a>.
*   **Disproportionate Unpaid Work** Unpaid care work, such as childcare, schooling, and caring for elderly parents, disproportionately falls on women across almost all nations, exacerbated by increased time at home during lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17"></a>.
*   **Job Losses** More women have lost their jobs than men due to higher rates of precarious or casual employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50"></a>. This impact is even greater for women of color, Indigenous women, and other marginalized groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:04"></a>.
*   **Threats to Reproductive Rights** Women's reproductive rights have become a battleground, with some states declaring abortion a "non-essential procedure," which particularly disadvantages poor women who cannot travel to other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17"></a>.
*   **Recovery Bias** Post-pandemic recovery projects often focus on "shovel-ready" large infrastructure, which disproportionately disadvantages women as few are employed in construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14"></a>. There is a need for job creation in caring professions like nursing and public health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32"></a>.

These challenges highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of achieving [[gender_equality_in_australia_and_globally | gender equality]] in diverse global contexts, requiring nuanced approaches that consider local cultural, economic, and social realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:50"></a>.

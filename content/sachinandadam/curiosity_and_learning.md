The Sachin Adam Show podcast emphasizes the importance of [[intellectual_curiosity_and_the_creation_of_timeless_content | curiosity]] and living an impactful life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Despite having produced 22 episodes, the hosts admit they don't fully know what the podcast is about, but they pursue it anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

The podcast was initiated because the hosts believe there are many amazing people in the world to [[learning_and_career_development_in_startup_environments | learn]] from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. They suggest that valuable [[learning_and_career_development_in_startup_environments | learning]] can be captured even over a cup of coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A core belief is that if one is open to [[learning_and_career_development_in_startup_environments | learning]] and willing to work hard, "the sky's the limit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The Hosts' Embodiment of Curiosity and Learning

The hosts, Sachin and Adam, both 21-year-old university students, exemplify the themes of [[intellectual_curiosity_and_the_creation_of_timeless_content | curiosity]] and [[learning_and_career_development_in_startup_environments | learning]] through their personal pursuits and academic choices.

### Sachin
Sachin identifies as an "annoyingly extroverted" university student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. His obsessions include social enterprise, fitness, and the philosophy of seeking discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Adam
Adam, the other half of the show, studies a mix of economics, philosophy, and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. He describes himself as "super curious about a bunch of things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, with a primary passion for the intersection of business and social impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## A Shared Journey of Self-Discovery

Both hosts are on their own journeys of [[selfdiscovery_and_finding_ones_place_in_the_world | self-discovery]] and finding their place in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. They acknowledge that anyone claiming to have life figured out is likely "bullshitting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The podcast serves as an invitation for listeners to join them on this journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

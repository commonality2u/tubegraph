[[Pathways into Management Consulting]]

The decision of a career path after university can be challenging, especially for business students who often consider conventional options such as consulting, law, or investment banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Both Sachin and Adam, co-hosts of The Sachin and Adam Show, aimed for highly successful and impactful careers, ultimately choosing management consulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. They believe they made the best decision possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

The pathways into consulting can be drastically different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Adam's Journey

Adam's initial passion was the public sector, specifically working for the UN, driven by a love for economics and a desire to help the greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. He pursued this interest with a four-month internship at the New South Wales Treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. However, he quickly became disillusioned with the culture, work, and people there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

This experience led to a personal crisis, where he almost dropped out of university to join the army full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Realizing this might not be the best idea, he committed to finding his true career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. His strategy involved two key actions:
1.  **Networking**: He connected with many people, learning about their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
2.  **Diverse Internships**: He undertook various internships, including in investment banking, corporate finance, multiple startups, and several consultancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Through these discussions and experiences, Adam discovered that consulting offered "awesome people" and "really fascinating projects," and he felt his skills were well-aligned with the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This exploration solidified his strong conviction to pursue consulting after university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Sachin's Journey

Sachin's university years were marked by an obsession with startups and [[entrepreneurship_and_risk_management_strategies | entrepreneurship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. During his first two years, he interned in venture capital and startups, embodying the "obnoxious startup boy" who believed "corporates are bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

However, in his third year, he decided to do a consulting internship, primarily to satisfy his Indian parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This decision proved transformative. Through a university program, he was placed on a team he "absolutely fell in love with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Despite expecting a world of suits and boring people, his very first project involved helping create VR headsets for people in rural Australian communities to access internships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This experience completely reshaped his perception of what "corporate" and "consulting" could be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Reasons for Choosing Consulting

Both Sachin and Adam ultimately chose management consulting for several compelling [[reasons_for_choosing_a_career_in_consulting | reasons for choosing a career in consulting]]:

*   **Exposure to Diverse Industries**: Consulting offers projects spanning various sectors like energy, financial services, government, and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This allows consultants to work on a wide range of problems, from creating new fintech apps for banks to conducting due diligence for multi-billion dollar private equity transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **The People**: Consulting attracts highly intelligent and ambitious individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. As a junior consultant, one gains the rare opportunity to be in the room with high-power executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Broad Set of Exit Opportunities**: Consulting often serves as a [[consulting_as_a_springboard_for_future_opportunities | springboard for future opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Due to the diverse and challenging nature of the work, consultants often transition to big tech, startups, investing (private equity or venture capital), or various industry roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

While the [[benefits_of_a_consulting_career | benefits of a consulting career]] are significant, there are also [[challenges_of_working_in_consulting | challenges of working in consulting]]:

*   **General Skill Set**: The exposure to many different industries can be a "double-edged sword." While fascinating for young professionals, the frequent project changes (every one to three months) limit the time to develop deep competencies in specific areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Work-Life Balance**: Not all consultancies offer a good work-life balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Many firms may require 60-80 hours of work per week, plus extended travel periods, making it difficult to maintain personal relationships and hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Management consulting is "definitely isn't any nine to five" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

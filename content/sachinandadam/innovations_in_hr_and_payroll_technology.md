Employment Hero, an Australian software company valued at over a billion dollars, specializes in creating software for HR and payroll functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Led by CEO and founder Ben Thompson, the company has navigated a period of significant macroeconomic challenges in the tech market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Strategic Approach in a Challenging Market

Employment Hero entered the recent economic downturn with a strong focus on maintaining optimal unit economics, a strategy instilled by John Henderson from AirTree during their Series A and B funding rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Despite high interest rates, the company has maintained exceptional net revenue retention and strong growth, benefiting from a tight employment market where recruitment remains a major challenge for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This environment has led Employment Hero to expand its services "Upstream" into the recruitment market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

Thompson develops strategic "master plans" that outline the company's long-term vision, with "Part One" and "Part Two" already executed, and "Part Three" currently underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. These plans are distilled, high-level perspectives on the company's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:00">[31:51:00]</a>.

## The Remote-First Philosophy

A cornerstone of Employment Hero's strategy, particularly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, is a "remote-first" approach to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. Ben Thompson emphasizes the social good of remote work, advocating for its preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

> "Remote work empowers those billions of people to live better lives, earn more money in better ways, legally and constructively contribute to societyâ€”like, that is what's at stake when I read these headlines... about we want people back to the office" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>

Key benefits and practices of the remote-first model include:
*   **Flexibility and Accessibility** It provides flexibility for working parents, individuals with disabilities, and pet carers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. It also enables people in rural communities to access high-powered jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.
*   **Global Talent Pool** Remote work connects billions of people in developing countries to the world of work, especially with advancements in internet access like Starlink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. Companies adopting a remote-first approach can recruit from anywhere, overcoming geographical limitations of traditional office-based hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Creativity** Thompson argues that intense thought and great ideas often come from solitude, not necessarily from in-person brainstorming sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
*   **Asynchronous Communication** To manage different time zones and individual work preferences, Employment Hero prioritizes asynchronous communication, using recorded messages and allowing employees to respond when it is most convenient for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:00">[22:10:00]</a>.
*   **Clear Objectives (OKRs)** Setting clear Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and giving employees autonomy and trust are crucial for effective remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>.
*   **Cultural Integration** Despite being a global workforce, Employment Hero fosters strong team bonds through deliberate efforts, such as an annual "Global Gathering" where all 825 employees are offered a paid trip to a foreign country for team building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:00">[25:52:00]</a>. The company's global remote-first approach naturally leads to a highly diverse workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>.

## Key Product Innovations

Employment Hero is moving beyond being just a core HR and payroll provider to become a comprehensive platform for managing human capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:09:00">[27:09:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is to simplify the process of acquiring and managing "talented labor working productively" for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>.

### Global Teams

This product is designed to enable small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to build and manage a global workforce with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.
*   **Legal Compliance and Payroll** Employment Hero has established employment entities in various countries and embedded legal minimum entitlements into its platform, along with organized payroll services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>.

This includes integration with LinkedIn for free job postings globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>.

### Swag (Consumer App)

Swag is Employment Hero's first consumer-facing application, built to leverage the substantial buying power of the over one million people managed by Employment Hero's payroll platform (representing about 15% of Australia's private sector workforce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:00">[33:01:00]</a>. The app aims to help employees manage the [[Challenges and innovations in the fintech industry | cost of living crisis]] by making them "better off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a>.
*   **Instapay** A key feature, Instapay, gives people real-time access to their earned wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:34:00">[34:34:00]</a>. Thompson envisions a future where people are paid hourly, with money ticking into their bank account as they work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:00">[35:04:00]</a>.
*   **Hero Shop** The app also offers discounts and other benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:26:00">[35:26:00]</a>.
*   **Employment Super App** Swag is envisioned as a comprehensive "employment super app" where users can find work, manage work, get paid, and manage their spending and saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:12:00">[36:12:00]</a>. It integrates employment history, allowing a user's CV to be constantly updated based on hours worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:41:00">[36:41:00]</a>.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI) Features

Employment Hero has already released several [[Artificial Intelligence and Workforce Transformation | AI features]] and is working on "Horizon 2" and "Horizon 3" features that are months or a year from release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:59:00">[37:59:00]</a>.

## Future Vision

Ben Thompson's vision is for Employment Hero to become the world's largest platform for managing human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:09:00">[27:09:00]</a>. The company aims to move beyond offering fragmented "point solutions" for HR functions, instead providing a unified platform that acts as the primary source of productive, skilled talent for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:23:00">[27:23:00]</a>. The platform will empower businesses to "supercharge the performance" of their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>. This ambitious goal is expected to be achieved sooner than the initially projected five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:14:00">[30:14:00]</a>.

The landscape of investment is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by a growing emphasis on social and environmental impact. Sir Ronald Cohen, a pivotal figure in this shift, not only effectively brought venture capital to the UK but also pioneered [[the_origins_and_evolution_of_impact_investing | impact investing]], revolutionizing the field by integrating social, environmental, and governance (ESG) standards into investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## The Evolution of Impact-Driven Capital

The concept of impact investing, initially nascent, has expanded dramatically. The underlying idea of social impact bonds, which link financial returns to social objectives, has transcended the charitable sector and entered the mainstream bond market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. In a remarkable development, a trillion dollars was raised in the last year through sustainability-linked bonds and loans, where the interest rate on the capital decreases if the company achieves a predefined social or environmental target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. This signifies a monumental shift in how capital is deployed, highlighting a future where financial success is intrinsically linked to positive societal and environmental outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

### Shifting Market Dynamics

This paradigm shift is driven by several factors:
*   **Consumer and Talent Preferences** [[Trends in consumer investing | Young consumers]] and talent are increasingly opting out of supporting companies that cause harm, instead seeking out entities with a positive societal footprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>.
*   **Investor Awareness** Investors have recognized this trend, leading to a surge in ESG-focused investments. What was once $13 trillion in ESG funds has now grown to over $40 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.
*   **Defined Impact Investing** Impact investment is now formally defined by the intention to create both impact and profit, coupled with the crucial element of measuring the impact generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. This sector, virtually non-existent previously, now commands over $2 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>.

## Optimizing for Risk, Return, and Impact

The economic system is undergoing a fundamental change, moving beyond the traditional balance of risk and return to an optimization of risk, return, and impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Soon, it will be unacceptable to pursue profits without considering their consequences on people and the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>.

### The Role of Technology in Impact Measurement
Values are changing, and [[the_impact_of_technology_and_AI_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | technology]] is once again at the forefront of this evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>. Powerful technologies like [[the_impact_of_technology_and_AI_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | artificial intelligence]] and machine learning are enabling the delivery of global impact in unprecedented ways, through innovations in [[the_future_impact_of_blockchain_and_fintech_in_emerging_markets | fintech]], remote learning, remote medicine, and [[Combating_Climate_Change_through_Investment | clean energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

A critical missing piece has been the standardized measurement of impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. Efforts are now focused on developing methods to measure a company's impact similar to how financial risk and profits are assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.

Sir Ronald Cohen has led an initiative at Harvard Business School to publish the environmental and employment impacts of thousands of companies in monetary terms, accessible through the HBS Impact-Weighted Accounts (IWA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. This research reveals:
*   Approximately 450 out of 3,000 companies assessed create more environmental damage than profit annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
*   A thousand companies generate damage equivalent to 25% or more of their profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>.
*   Two-thirds of companies create less than a quarter of their profit in damage, indicating a pathway to transition to net zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

Furthermore, impact measurement extends to diversity, with data on "diversity debit" providing insights into employment demographics. For example, Amazon has a $6 billion diversity debit, while Apple has $2.5 billion. However, relative to total wages, Amazon (16% diversity debit) performs better than Apple (24%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.

## The Future of Business and Investment

For the next generation of leaders, the business environment demands transparency on impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. The most successful companies, exemplified by Tesla, integrate a positive objective beyond mere profit-making into their core mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. Elon Musk's creation of a trillion dollars in value over 20 years stems from aligning with consumer demand for less polluting products, attracting top talent, and gaining investor confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. This represents a "mega-trend" where new models will emerge that achieve social good while ensuring financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>.

The ability to measure and manage impacts is becoming an imperative for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. This includes redefining product strategies to deliver health improvement instead of degradation, as seen in the case of Danone, which, despite its impact-driven leadership, faced challenges related to the health harm caused by the sugar content in its products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.

Research from Harvard shows a correlation between companies that pollute more and lower stock market valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. Companies that deliver positive impact attract consumers, talent, and investors, ultimately becoming more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. This new model of optimizing for risk, return, and impact is seen as the future of successful, valuable companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.

### Key Problem Areas for Impact Investment
While various areas demand attention, Sir Ronald Cohen emphasizes education as the most significant lever for social improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. Despite its importance, education systems, particularly in emerging countries, often fall short in fostering social mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>.

An initiative, the Education Outcomes Fund, aims to revolutionize educational attainment globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>. This billion-dollar fund for education in Africa and the Middle East, led by Dr. Anna Kabul, uses a "pay-for-success" model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>. Professional teams sign contracts with NGOs and businesses, promising payment upon the achievement of specific educational outcomes (e.g., improving the education of 300,000 children for $30 million), with higher payments for girls, rural students, or children with disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. This model attracts investment through funds, such as a $100 million fund from UBS and Bridges Ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. This approach enables social entrepreneurs to raise capital based on their ability to deliver measurable improvements, with investors receiving returns linked to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. With 800 million children globally out of education or not learning, such funds could transform attainment levels worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.

The future of business and investment is one where companies, individuals, and systems are designed to "do good and do well" simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. This dual approach is essential to address the consequences of capitalism, including planetary destruction, economic inequality, and the erosion of social mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.

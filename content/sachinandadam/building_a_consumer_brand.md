Building a resonant consumer brand in today's competitive market requires a blend of strategic vision, deep customer understanding, and a willingness to iterate rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Ellie Hansen, a principal investor at Sid Stage Ventures and a previously exited founder of consumer companies, shares insights from her experience in advertising, founding companies like Flos, and investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Key Principles of Brand Building

### Understanding the Customer
A core aspect of building a consumer brand is listening to customers to understand what they truly want, not just what a founder *thinks* they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This means:
*   **Customer Data:** Taking in customer data with an "ear to the ground" and listening to trends in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Human Insight:** Brands that succeed understand an honest truism about the human condition that resonates with most people, allowing for empathy and shared experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>. For example, the common experience of flossing rigorously a week before a dentist appointment to appear diligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>.

### The Role of Stubbornness and Vision
While listening to customers is crucial, a founder also needs to balance this with their own intuition and vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This requires a degree of stubbornness, which is common among successful founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. It's about having a deep perspective on the world and sticking to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Product and Storytelling
[[Branding and marketing strategies|Branding and marketing strategies]] are vital for a consumer brand, which relies heavily on storytelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. However, it's not everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. The product itself must be amazing and loved by customers; it needs to "sell itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. Ellie Hansen, being an industrial designer by trade, prioritizes product design first, followed by marketing and advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

### The "Good Enough" Principle
A key lesson in [[Branding and marketing strategies|building a consumer brand]] is to "don't let perfect be the enemy of good, and good be the enemy of done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. It's more important to get a message out there, test, iterate, and receive feedback than to strive for absolute perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. Often, the less polished work is what truly resonates with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

## Performance Marketing vs. Brand Building
Historically, creative advertising (focused on big brand ideas like "Nike: Just Do It") has been segregated from performance marketing (often relegated to social media) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. However, Ellie Hansen argues that these are inherently linked and additive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.

> "Your brand is every experience and expression, uh, of, of, for the customer, you know, it's every idea, experience, and expression that's out there in the world and that includes your social media, that includes your storefront, that includes your website, that includes your packaging. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>"

If a customer's primary interaction with a brand is through social media (e.g., UGC on TikTok), then that becomes their entire brand experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>. Therefore, all marketing efforts, including performance marketing, must be grounded in the overarching brand story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.

### Optimizing the Funnel
To effectively integrate performance marketing and brand, founders must be highly attuned to their marketing funnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>. This means measuring every data point to identify specific issues:
*   **Click-through rate (CTR):** A low CTR indicates creative is not resonating in performance marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.
*   **Bounce rate:** A high bounce rate suggests problems with website messaging, imagery, or copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.
*   **Add-to-cart/Checkout:** Issues here point to different creative or user experience problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

Understanding these granular details allows for targeted A/B testing and iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

## Case Study: Flos
Ellie Hansen co-founded Flos, the world's first patented electric flosser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Despite flossing being an "unsexy" industry often associated with fear, stigma, and shame, Flos aimed to inject fun into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

*   **Brand Strategy:** Flos defined itself as an "accessibility brand," focused on making flossing accessible to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.
*   **Playful Branding:** They used humorous taglines like "Good Oral" to evoke a smile and challenge the serious nature of oral care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.
*   **Attention to Detail:** Accessibility was integrated into every touch point, including learning Braille to put it on product packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.
*   **"Oral Beauty":** Flos identified an opportunity to position oral care within the beauty industry, contrasting with the traditionally "boring and hygienic" aesthetic of dental products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>. This aspirational branding sought to make flossing feel like a pampering beauty routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.
*   **Habit Building:** Drawing on behavioral science, they focused on gamification and nudges to help customers build a regular flossing habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.

## Navigating Cultural Nuances in Branding
[[Cultural influences on branding|Cultural influences on branding]] significantly impact a brand's willingness to take risks and stand out.

### US vs. Australia
*   **Service Culture:** The US has a strong culture of service and exceptional customer touch points, which often bleeds into product design (e.g., Slack's time zone message feature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.
*   **Offensive Advertising:** Australian advertising has historically been more willing to be offensive and is known for its world-class humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.
*   **Risk Aversion:** Despite this, Australian founders may be less willing to create polarizing brands due to "tall poppy syndrome," a fear of being cut down for standing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. This can lead to "nothing burger" brands that are not loved or hated, failing to cut through the noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>.
*   **Competition Culture:**
    *   **US:** A "dog-eat-dog" culture where winning often means beating the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>. This encourages differentiation and bold statements.
    *   **Australia:** More of an "underdog" culture where success is about beating the odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>. This fosters a more collaborative and egalitarian environment but might disincentivize founders from taking risky, polarizing stances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.

### The Value of Polarization
For a brand to cut through in a crowded market, it often needs to be polarizing, meaning 80% of people might not love it, but 20% will deeply resonate with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:31">[00:45:31]</a>. This can be scary for founders, as it involves putting the business and oneself "on the line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. However, clearly defining a brand's stance sends a "bat signal" to those who agree, fostering strong loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.

## Future of Consumer Brands: D2C vs. Retail
The economics of Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) have shifted; customer acquisition costs (CAC) have significantly increased, making traditional D2C less viable for some categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. This has led to an "equalization" between D2C and retail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>. Winning D2C brands often have:
*   A celebrity-backed approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>.
*   A sticky organic content strategy (e.g., on TikTok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>.

Australian consumer brands have a unique opportunity for global expansion.
*   **Revered Lifestyle:** There's a recognition in the US market that Australian lifestyle and brand are highly revered and loved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.
*   **Geographical Advantage:** Australia's geographical location offers access to APAC markets, which American brands often only consider at later stages (Series B+) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>. This breaks down the traditional "limiting factor of geography" for Australian consumer brands seeking venture-scale returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. Examples of globally successful Australian brands include Aesop, Zimmermann, and Who Gives A Crap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

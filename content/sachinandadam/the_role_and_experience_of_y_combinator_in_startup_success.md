Y Combinator (YC) is widely considered the most prestigious accelerator program in the world, mentoring startups with some of the biggest names in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:25">[01:34:25]</a>. It attracts top investors and startups, creating a significant network effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:09">[02:36:09]</a>.

## Moses Low's Journey to Y Combinator
Moses Low, a fintech entrepreneur, grew up in Australia and later moved to the U.S. to attend Y Combinator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. He initially graduated from UNSW with a high distinction before starting his career as a management consultant at BCG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. His startup, Zendit, became the first Indonesian business to go through Y Combinator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:47">[01:28:47]</a>.

Moses's journey into entrepreneurship was influenced by an early life game at age 13, where he discovered a knack for business by creating monopolies and strategic pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. He was fascinated by the capital reserve system and the idea of banks printing money, leading him to study finance and information systems with an ambition to "own a bank one day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. He learned about startups from the Atlassian founders, who were a few years ahead of him in a scholarship program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

He chose management consulting to learn how businesses think and how to structure thoughts, aiming to gain confidence in speaking to senior figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. His goal was always to get to Silicon Valley, seeing Australia as too small for big ideas and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:48">[01:06:48]</a>. An MBA at Berkeley provided a route into the Valley, allowing him to leverage the "student card" and access a vast network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

> [!quote] Advice on Entrepreneurship and Startup Success
> Moses was advised by mentor Justin Kan to "be a cockroach," emphasizing survival and doing "whatever it takes to survive" in the startup world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. This "cockroach mentality" is embraced internally at Zendit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Another key piece of [[advice_on_entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | advice on entrepreneurship and startup success]] was to keep personal burn low, enabling more options in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.

## Experience in YC Proper
Moses's experience with YC's main program, "YC Proper," was unique because he was based in Asia and missed many in-person dinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. However, he highlights three key benefits:

### Pressure Cooker Environment
Initially, Moses felt Zendit was "probably the worst decision YC had ever made," comparing himself to other successful companies in the batch, like a drone delivery company that signed with NASA or an Australian compliance software company growing profits 20% monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This intense environment forced a choice: "Do you cry? Do you work harder?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. The pressure cooker was ultimately beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Quality of Advice
YC provided invaluable advice from "billion-dollar founders" like Jeff Ralston (Yahoo Mail founder), Jessica Livingston (YC co-founder), and Justin Kan (Twitch founder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. This advice was rooted in direct experience: "When I face my situation in this company, this is what we did in company B, this is what we did and at Twitch this is what we did" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Justin Kan's advice on how to pivot was particularly critical, changing Zendit's trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

### Demo Day Advantage
YC creates a "perfect situation" where startups are perceived as the "hottest company for a day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This "stamp" from YC was crucial for Zendit to raise capital, especially for a company focused on Indonesia, a market few knew about in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## Experience in YC Growth
Moses also participated in "YC Growth," a different program for growth-stage companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. This 12-week program involved a more intimate group of 18 companies, with CEOs of mega-growth companies brought in to share insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. Problems faced by Series B onwards companies are more similar across the board (e.g., scaling, hiring executives, compensation) compared to early-stage companies trying to find product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Moses took extensive notes and implemented many of the strategies discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Impact and Legacy
Y Combinator significantly influenced Moses's mindset, exposing him to "billion-dollar ideas" and shaping his perspective on the startup world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. A key anecdote involved Rob Chandra, a successful VC, who told Moses not to talk to him unless his idea was "worth a billion dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This expectation shifted Moses's self-belief, making him realize he *could* come up with such ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

Zendit leveraged the classic consumer startup playbook, copied from companies like PayPal and Uber, by "giving away money for free" to drive viral effects and incentivize referrals, leading to rapid user growth once product-market fit was found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This strategy helped Zendit acquire 16,000 users in six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

Moses envisions Zendit as a digital infrastructure business for Southeast Asia, building essential services like payments, credit risk, and data products, similar to what AWS did for compute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. He also aims to foster a "Zendit mafia," inspiring a new generation of entrepreneurs who build companies that "change our world" and do "good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. As a measure of this [[building_a_successful_tech_startup | building a successful tech startup]], two Zendit alums have already been accepted into YC, a significant increase from zero Indonesian companies in YC five years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

Startups globally are increasingly prioritizing "high taste" designers and creatives, a trend driven by advancements in technology and the evolving landscape of creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This shift highlights a fundamental change in what differentiates successful companies in a crowded market.

## Why High Taste Matters

The core reason for this emphasis lies in the diminishing cost of creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. As tools like AI make it easier and faster to produce content and products—envision creating an entire movie in minutes through prompting—the challenge shifts from execution to conception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The difficult part is no longer *how* to build, but *what* to build—the "taste of the idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

As [[product_development_and_innovation_in_tech_startups | everything gets easier to build]], there will be increased competition in every category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. In this environment, [[role_of_design_and_taste_in_business | design and taste]] become crucial differentiators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. While some might see this as a new trend, truly great founders have always prioritized design and possessed good taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

## Design in AI and Consumer Technology

A prime example of this trend is OpenAI's partnership with Jony Ive's Hardware IO, signaling a move beyond being solely a model company to becoming a general consumer technology company that integrates hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. This strategic decision by OpenAI aims to position them as the "next Apple," but with AI powering the entire stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

In the consumer space, [[importance_of_effective_branding_and_pr_for_startups | brand]] and user interface design create a significant "brand moat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Users develop familiarity and comfort with interfaces like ChatGPT, making them less likely to switch even if competing products, such as Google AI Studio, offer similar capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. This suggests that a strong brand built on intuitive design can be a powerful competitive advantage in AI-driven markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

## The Role of Creativity and Taste

The overarching theme for successful startups is the intersection of technology and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>. This cultural focus applies across all facets of a business, from product development to sales and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.

For individuals, [[pursuing_quality_and_taste_in_creative_work | cultivating taste]] and [[the_role_of_creativity_in_tech_startups | creativity]] can stem from diverse sources, such as art history, documentaries, and biographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. This engagement with varied interests, even if seemingly unrelated to business, can lead to unexpected insights and a stronger sense of curiosity, which pays off in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

> "Curiosity actually does pay off in the long run and you don't need to try and always be utilitarian about it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>

The focus on [[identifying_and_hiring_talent_in_startups | hiring]] individuals who can creatively direct and contribute to a high-quality output, like Tom's role in media operations, underscores the practical application of this philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. It's about bringing "magic" and "highest quality" to the user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Ultimately, while models may commoditize, the ability to build and brand applications with high taste remains critical for gaining market share and fostering user relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. This is why companies that master [[the_influence_of_branding_on_vc_firms_and_startups | branding]] and design are set to lead in the evolving tech landscape.

Instant, founded by Liam Milwood at age 17, has rapidly grown into a $100 million company in just four years, managing a team of 70 and expanding globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The company aims to grow at 25% month-on-month and achieve a billion-dollar valuation within the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Driving Force Behind Growth

Liam Milwood's intense drive stems from a desire to prove doubters wrongâ€”whether it's employees with no respect for the company, investors who dismissed Instant as a "side hustle," or those who rejected their early efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This competitive spirit is balanced by a motivation to prove right those who believed in him, including his parents who invested in the early angel round, and to make early employees wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. His overarching goal is to build the best and fastest-growing company in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

The journey of a startup is described as having significant ups and downs, ranging from "super depressing" to "super fulfilled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The excitement of building something truly impactful often overrides the stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:35">[03:15:35]</a>.

## Core [[strategies_for_rapid_growth_and_success_in_startups | Strategies for Rapid Growth]]

### Revenue Obsession

A fundamental shift towards being obsessively focused on revenue became Instant's northstar goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Instead of numerous OKRs, the company had one clear objective: achieve a million dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>. This goal was gamified internally as "million dollars to hoola," with the promise of a team trip to Hawaii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>. This singular focus aligned the entire organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>.

### Speed and Urgency

Instant emphasizes speed and urgency as core values, viewing "momentum" as the solution to every company issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:06">[03:06:06]</a>. This is achieved through:
*   **Weekly Sprints**: Everything operates on a week-by-week basis, with weekly sprints towards quarterly goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:52">[01:51:52]</a>. This prevents slowdowns and ensures consistent prioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Decision-Making**: People are empowered to make decisions quickly and work flexibly, as long as they achieve their clearly defined weekly targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Overthinking**: The company actively avoids the "slowness" and "overthinking" that can come from traditional corporate backgrounds, instead infusing an energy to "go and figure out how to achieve it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### Talent and Team Structure

Instant's approach to talent and team structure supports its rapid growth:
*   **Hiring "A-Players"**: The company looks for individuals who are competitive, good communicators, and possess the energy to move quickly, often displaying signals like speaking quickly or loudly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:12">[03:22:12]</a>. A key perk listed on their website is the opportunity to "work with A players" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:01">[03:32:01]</a>.
*   **Lean Team and Focus**: They avoid a bloated team, getting rid of underperformers quickly and ensuring individuals are obsessed with one particular focus area (e.g., a salesperson focusing only on Australian revenue targets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:50">[01:59:50]</a>.
*   **Centralized Operations**: An early and conscious decision was made to centralize the operations team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:50">[04:49:50]</a>. This offloads time-consuming administrative tasks (like finding sales contacts, updating CRMs) from core roles, allowing salespeople to focus on selling, marketers on lead generation, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:46">[04:57:46]</a>.
*   **Strategic Hires**: Controversial but impactful early hires included a personal assistant (eighth hire) to manage the founder's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:50">[05:37:50]</a> and in-house recruiters to ensure a consistent pipeline of talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:33">[05:03:33]</a>.
*   **Positive Culture**: Leaders are coached to lead with positivity, fostering a supportive environment where clear direction and feedback (positive and negative) help people grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>. In-person work, especially early on, helped build a positive and communicative culture, reducing HR issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:18">[05:15:18]</a>.
*   **Strong Leadership Alignment**: A tight, trusting core leadership team (CEO, co-founder, COO) where direct, uncensored discussions can occur without fear of stressing out colleagues, which then ripples through the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:13">[05:52:13]</a>.

### [[fundraising_and_business_growth_strategies | Fundraising]]

Instant successfully raised $18 million in 10 days for its Series A round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Strategic elements of their fundraising included:
*   **Timing**: Raising capital when it wasn't critically needed, and timing the raise at the end of the year to create urgency for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:06">[06:04:06]</a>.
*   **Creating Urgency**: Using tactics like sending investor updates instead of formal pitch decks and implying existing term sheets to accelerate the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>.
*   **Investor Focus**: Hummingbird, a key investor, focused heavily on assessing the founder's character and thinking rather than just metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:20">[05:18:20]</a>.

## Product Expansion

While initially successful with a checkout product, significant revenue growth came from their "Audiences" product, which grew from zero to over 500 customers and $7-8 million in revenue in 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Instant plans to further expand its product suite to own 20-25% of a merchant's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a> and aims to build the first completely automated retention marketing platform for e-commerce brands, essentially an AI-powered marketing manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

## Global Expansion

Instant's growth journey began in Australia, where they leveraged market knowledge and connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:48">[04:48:48]</a>. Their approach to US expansion involved a key learning: treating it like starting a whole new business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This means rebuilding brand reputation, securing initial big customers, and hiring strong local talent, rather than expecting Australian strategies to directly translate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. The company aims to replicate its multi-million dollar monthly revenue growth in the US and other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

Maintaining "hyperfocus" is critical during international expansion, ensuring teams in different regions (e.g., Australia vs. US) remain concentrated on their specific objectives without distraction from other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

## AI's Impact on Retail Software

While initially skeptical of the AI hype, Instant has strategically moved into building AI-powered products, aiming for product-led growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. AI is seen as a way to "supercharge" brands' ability to execute at the same velocity as larger competitors, particularly in areas like content creation, retention marketing, and advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. For retention marketing, AI enables continuous, personalized changes to messaging and offers based on customer behavior, a task impossible for a human marketing manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

## Differences Between US and Australian Startups

Liam Milwood observes that US startups, particularly in San Francisco and New York, exhibit an incredible pace and sense of urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. People talk in weeks rather than months, and there's a strong competitive drive to be the best, knowing that otherwise, the company might "die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. The caliber of talent in the US is perceived as insane, often stemming from previous startup experience, intense university backgrounds, or a deep-seated need to prove something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

While some Australian startups move into the US very early, Instant found success by first establishing strong growth in Australia to fund its international expansion, learning regional differences along the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Instant's northstar is to achieve a billion-dollar valuation by the end of 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. Key future goals include having at least three products in the market, each generating over $10 million in revenue, and making a significant impact on the US market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. The company continues to forward-plan rigorously, anticipating future hiring and product development needs well in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

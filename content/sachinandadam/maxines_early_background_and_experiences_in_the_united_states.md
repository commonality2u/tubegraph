[[maxine_minters_journey_as_australias_first_female_solo_gp | Maxine Minter]] is Australia's first female solo GP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. She is described as incredibly driven, passionate, and sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Her current venture is Coventures, a $10 million pre-seed fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Early Background
As a child, Maxine was fascinated with "how stuff works" and was obsessed with books about how bricks, concrete, and building materials were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Her mother recounted a story of a four-year-old Maxine looking into a manhole and declaring, "I believe in bricks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

In her teenage years, Maxine made a "hard pivot away from anything intellectual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, describing herself as an "absolute grommet" who hung out at the beach and focused on fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. She didn't love school and was at the bottom of her class for English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

However, in year 10, she decided she wanted to do well academically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, stopping drinking in year 11 and focusing on improving in English and Math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This shift led her to fall in love with intellectual pursuit and the feeling of striving for mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. She discovered a deep love of intellectual stimulation and curiosity, particularly "understanding how something works at its brass tax" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. An example of this was reading the entire Australian Constitution before starting law school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This intellectual journey was influenced by a high school teacher, Mrs. Hickey, who made being good at English seem "cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

Maxine pursued law at university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, initially aiming to be a criminal barrister influenced by "Law and Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. She spent almost a decade in law, starting as a paralegal in her first year of law school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. She enjoyed the intellectual stimulation and structured environment of law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>, working with influential mentors like Dan Friedman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

Despite her mother being an entrepreneur who built businesses out of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, the concept of a "startup" or "entrepreneur" was not in Maxine's "vernacular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a> until she left Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. She even started her first company in her second year of law school primarily for cash flow, not conceptualizing it as a large business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

## Experiences in the United States
Maxine decided to move to the US to "see what the future looks like for the law and then try to bring it back to Australia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. She chose Stanford University for its well-known interdisciplinary work, intending to study business and computer science alongside law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

Her time at Stanford's Graduate School of Business (GSB) shifted her perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. She felt more at home with the "pace of new ideas" and the "dynamism of the people" there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. Unlike the rigid law field, where intellectual curiosity was not celebrated, the GSB and the startup ecosystem valued it immensely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.

A pivotal moment was taking Fern Mendelbaum's course on "entrepreneurship from diverse perspectives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. This course blew her mind and was one of the first times she identified her own mother as an entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>, realizing that her mother's hustling in a yoga-related business was a form of entrepreneurship not celebrated in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

### Cultural Contrasts: Australia vs. USA
Maxine observed significant cultural differences between Australia and the US, a topic she explored in depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. She noted that in America, there's a celebration of "outlier behavior," with "everyone trying to be different from each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. This individualism is deeply ingrained in the US cultural fabric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

In contrast, Australia is "very much focused on collectivism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>, where people tend to be more similar than different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. She gives an example of finding almost identical outfits and shoes in many parts of Sydney (e.g., Paddington, Surry Hills, Bondi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>, while this density of similarity is harder to find in diverse US cities like San Francisco, except perhaps in specific areas like the Marina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.

### Executive Coaching in the US
Maxine found that in the US, there was a universal desire to be at the top of one's field, leading to a natural embrace of executive coaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. Many top performers, especially those with backgrounds as elite athletes, saw coaches as essential for performance uplift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. This contrasted with her initial experience in Australia in 2020, where executive coaches were often seen as "therapy adjacent" rather than "performance adjacent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. This shift in perception was a key learning for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

She later learned to invest in the "US style" of pre-seed investing, a model that Australia did not yet institutionalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. This perspective, gained from an ecosystem that had been compounding for decades, helped her identify a unique opportunity in Australia's underfunded pre-seed market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>, leading to the foundation of Coventures.

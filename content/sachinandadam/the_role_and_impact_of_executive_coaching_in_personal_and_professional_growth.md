Executive coaching is a field focused on enhancing an individual's performance and development in a professional context. Maxine Minter, Australia's first female solo General Partner (GP) and a former executive coach, has deep insights into the role and impact of coaching, having both experienced it herself and coached top performers in Silicon Valley startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Understanding Executive Coaching

Executive coaching aims to help individuals, particularly leaders and founders, achieve higher performance and navigate complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. Maxine notes that in the U.S., there's a widespread desire to be at the top of one's field, which naturally leads to seeking assistance from people who can help achieve that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>. This mirrors the sports world, where athletes have coaches to observe their performance, apply frameworks, and guide them through processes of performance uplift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.

## Shift in Perception: Performance vs. Therapy

When Maxine returned to Australia in 2020, she observed that executive coaches were often perceived as "therapy adjacent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. However, in the U.S., the view was much more "performance adjacent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. This perception is now shifting in Australia, with a growing recognition of coaching's role in professional development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. For Maxine, having a coach transformed what would have been one of the hardest journeys of her life into a "fun" experience, akin to being in a constant [[personal_and_professional_growth_through_coaching | dopamine of learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.

## Key Learnings and "Unlocks" from Executive Coaching

Executive coaching provides significant "unlocks" by helping individuals address specific challenges and develop crucial skills.

### From Competition to Collaboration

Maxine highlights a profound shift from a competitive mindset to one of collaboration, inspired by Megan Kash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. While competition can build motivation, collaboration is a "much more sustainably powerful place" to build motivation and generate incredible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Maxine found that competition was often a long-term destructive force for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This realization came from an "aha moment" in coaching, where she understood that a competitive mindset can negatively influence outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

### Navigating Interpersonal Dynamics and Soft Skills

A common challenge faced by executives, especially as they scale organizations, is the mastery of interpersonal dynamics and soft skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. Executives are measured not by their intentions or what they say, but by what their team does with the information received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. It can be frustrating for those who excel in tactical and analytical areas to find themselves unable to "control" outcomes in the realm of human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. Coaches help executives learn to influence others, maximize team potential, and improve co-founder dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.

### The Psychology of Personal Performance

Coaching also delves into the psychology of one's own performance, helping individuals understand their optimal working methods and lean into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. This includes recognizing and addressing issues like feeling overwhelmed or working on the wrong things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>.

### Strategic Focus and Long-Term Vision

Founders often juggle multiple time scales, from weekly tasks to long-term game strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. Coaching helps founders prioritize problems, strategize their focus, and think about how to build the business over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. It also prompts reflection on who they need to become as a leader in the future, as the company's success is dependent on their [[personal_and_professional_growth_through_coaching | personal growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.

## The Founder's Journey: Adapting to Growth

The growth of a company, particularly in a startup environment, is often exponential, while human development is non-linearâ€”characterized by plateaus and sudden "unlocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>. This means the company can only move as fast as its founder is able to move, or it will outpace them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. The skills required to reach the first million in revenue are often completely different from those needed for the next million or 100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>.

Great founders, like Alex of Linktree, demonstrate an incredible ability to learn, combining low ego with high influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>. This allows them to embrace a "beginner's mindset" even in high-stakes environments, absorbing information and rapidly accelerating their learning curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. The humility to admit "I don't know, can you help me learn?" is a powerful [[personal_and_professional_growth_through_coaching | skill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

## Transferable Skills from Coaching to Venture Capital

Maxine identifies several skills gained from her coaching practice that are crucial in the VC world:
*   **Building Rapport:** Establishing trust and ensuring the person knows you are "on their side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.
*   **Explicit Communication:** Clearly stating intentions and goals, which helps manage expectations and avoid misinterpretations (the "impact and intention" framework) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Radical Candor and Kindness:** Communicating directly with genuine care for the other person's best interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. This requires monitoring one's own state, as resentment or fatigue can hinder effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.
*   **Assessing Growth Mindset and Grit:** In pre-seed investing, where data is limited, assessing a founder's [[changing_beliefs_and_personal_growth | growth mindset]] and grit is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>. This involves looking at self-reported mindset, past performance, and diligence through speaking to others who know the individual, as well as observing [[personal_growth_and_selfawareness | self-awareness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>. An "absence of openness" can be a sign of discomfort, which might indicate a lack of vulnerability needed for rapid development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.

## Maintaining Work-Life Harmony and Preventing Burnout

Executive coaching emphasizes the importance of managing one's life to maintain effectiveness and prevent burnout.
*   **Time and Energy Management:** Maxine meticulously tracks her time, planning her day religiously and constantly asking if she's working on the "highest leverage thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>. This allows for hard trade-offs, delegation, and reprioritization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a>.
*   **Joy Auditing:** Regularly auditing activities that bring joy versus those that sap energy allows for prioritizing work that leads to sustained effort and satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>.
*   **Work-Life Harmony:** This involves balancing work with activities that nourish and provide "cross-training" for the mind, such as advisory work, committee roles, or chatting with people from diverse industries and stages of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>. It also crucially includes dedicated time for personal relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Decision Fatigue:** Simplifying routine decisions (like choosing clothes or even a life partner) frees up mental energy for higher-leverage, impactful decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>.
*   **The Danger of Stress:** Being constantly in "fight or flight" mode can neurologically hamper decision-making, leading to poor choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. Giving oneself space to think and make decisions from a calm place is essential for optimal performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>.
*   **Individualized Approach:** Recognizing that "universal laws" about performance don't apply to every unique individual is key. [[Personal Growth and Work Life Balance | Work-life harmony]] is achieved by running experiments and compounding on personal insights to find what truly works for oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>.

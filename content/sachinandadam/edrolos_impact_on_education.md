Edrolo is an ed-tech startup co-founded by Duncan Anderson, whose mission is to improve education by providing resources to secondary schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The company aims to foster a "love of learning" among students by making educational content engaging and relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Duncan Anderson himself is characterized as a "hyper-learner" with a "crazy growth mindset," constantly seeking to learn about himself and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Core Philosophy and Mission

Duncan Anderson believes that one's mind is their "ultimate creation" and that individuals should consistently upgrade themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The purpose of Edrolo is to help minds reach a point where they can build themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. He argues that existing curriculums can be either interesting or boring, and unfortunately, they are often boring for many students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, leading to rote learning rather than true understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

Edrolo aims to create educational resources that students "love or like," moving away from the common "dislike or hate" sentiment towards existing materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The foundational principle is that understanding is crucial; if students cannot understand, nothing is interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Evolution of Edrolo's Approach

Initially, Edrolo started as a two-sided tutoring marketplace, inspired by the idea of "YouTube for VCE or YouTube for HSC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. This model aimed to democratize access to great teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. This initial product found significant traction, especially in Victoria, where it achieved about 97% penetration in schools for its product and over 80% market share in various subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.

Over time, the company's strategy evolved based on what they learned about the education market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. The core insight was to influence the maximum amount of time students spend learning, which means integrating with the core resources used in classrooms, historically textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. Edrolo shifted towards creating a new generation of "hybrid resources" that combine the video content with textbook-like materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. This led them to become a significant printer of educational materials, shipping "40 container shipped worth of paper" in a year, a surprising outcome for an ed-tech company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

## Unique Content Creation and Pedagogical Approach

Edrolo's approach is distinguished by:
*   **In-house Content Creation:** Unlike traditional educational publishers that often rely on part-time teacher-authors, Edrolo employs full-time, in-house content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. This allows them to spend significantly more time (five to ten times more) developing resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>, ensuring quality and accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.
*   **Extensive Research and Development:** A typical resource takes about a year to build, with the first six months dedicated solely to research and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>. Teams of up to ten people prototype content, analyze academic research, and review existing products to identify best practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>.
*   **Emphasis on Mental Models and Innovation:** Edrolo integrates mental models into every core unit of learning across subjects like math, science, and humanities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>. For instance, in mathematics, they create visual models and systematically embed a "math vocab bank" of over 100 operator words extracted from standardized tests like NAPLAN and PISA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>.
*   **Discouraging Rote Learning:** They intentionally vary question structures to prevent students from simply memorizing procedures. By changing the placement of unknowns in word problems, students are forced to understand the underlying concepts and apply a "unit of innovation" to solve problems, rather than relying on "if-then statements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. This aligns with findings that muddling up questions and testing for deeper insight leads to astronomical results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Vision for Education

Edrolo faces significant [[challenges_in_the_current_education_system | challenges]] because its product (content) and acquisition (sales to schools) do not easily scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. Content made for one curriculum (e.g., Year 12 math in Victoria) cannot be directly sold to another (e.g., Year 12 math in New South Wales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>. Sales to schools often require intensive enterprise sales efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>.

Despite these hurdles, Edrolo's long-term [[the_future_of_education_and_online_learning | vision for education]] is ambitious. Duncan Anderson believes that the education system is paramount for preparing humans for a future where repetitive jobs are increasingly replaced by machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>. The goal is to raise the proportion of people who can "upgrade themselves" or perform non-repetitive jobs from a current estimated one-third to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. This focus on cultivating innovation ability within existing curriculums is seen as crucial for preventing a "useless class" and addressing societal inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.

Edrolo focuses on improving [[the_role_of_education_in_social_improvement | education]] within the existing system rather than advocating for radical changes like new curriculums, more funding, or different teachers, acknowledging the difficulty of enacting such large-scale reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. The key is to make existing content "delicious and nutritious" to combat the prevalent sentiment that learning is "dislike or hate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. By providing high-quality, engaging resources that can capture a majority of the six hours a day young people spend learning, Edrolo aims to significantly influence human minds and contribute to societal progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.

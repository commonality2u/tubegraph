The technology, media, and telecommunications (TMT) industry is experiencing a rapid rate of change due to the convergence of various [[predicting_future_trends_in_society_space_art_and_technology | mega trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>. This sector often acts as a bellwether for new technologies and their integration into society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

## Impact of Technology and AI

Several key technologies are profoundly influencing the TMT landscape:
*   [[the_impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | Artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>
*   [[the_impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | Advanced wireless networks]] like 5G and Wi-Fi 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>
*   [[the_impact_of_technology_and_ai_on_future_industries_and_opportunities | Cloud computing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>

These trends are integrating into various parts of the industry, including media, broadcast media, and journalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.

## COVID-19's Influence on Telecommunications

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the telecommunications (telco) industry, calling into question previous assumptions and creating new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>. Telcos have faced consistent margin squeeze over the last decade due to cheaper data and optimized customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

Research suggests two critical uncertainties for telcos:
1.  Their ability to monetize critical infrastructure, such as fiber and mobile networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.
2.  The rate at which customers adopt more digital interactions across all types of organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.

Examples of increased digital interactions include [[future_trends_and_transformations_in_education_technology | telehealth]] and [[future_trends_and_transformations_in_education_technology | online education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

In response to these scenarios, telcos face strategic choices:
*   **Seize opportunities**: Develop and monetize new offerings related to digital interactions, such as virtual health or education services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.
*   **Bunker down**: Cut costs and focus on reducing the cost to serve, especially if economic conditions worsen and consumers are unwilling to pay extra for services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. This shift towards a commodity game is accelerating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.

## Innovation in Technology

### Hyper-Quantified Athlete and Sports Monetization
A significant trend involves the "hyper-quantified athlete" and its potential to monetize previously unmonetizable or "tier two" sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>. By gathering extensive [[role_of_data_and_technology_in_media_and_entertainment | data]] on each game, player, and play, it becomes possible to provide streaming, enable wagering, and unlock other applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

### Monetization of Women's Sports
Australia is seen as a leader in the monetization of women's sports, which, despite immense talent, globally remains a relatively small industry compared to the male-dominated multi-billion dollar sports market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>. Technology and increased emphasis on female talent could lead to a more equal playing field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.

## The Future of Streaming and Subscriptions

Streaming services like Netflix have fundamentally changed the media and [[role_of_data_and_technology_in_media_and_entertainment | entertainment]] landscape by offering personalized recommendations and vast content choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.

Key observations and [[predicting_future_trends_in_society_space_art_and_technology | predictions]] regarding streaming and subscriptions:
*   **High Adoption**: 90% of Australians have a streaming video on demand subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.
*   **Multiple Subscriptions**: 20-25% of Australians have at least five streaming subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>, and on average, people have 10-12 digital subscriptions (including news, music, video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>.
*   **Re-aggregation**: The "unbundling" of pay TV bundles has led to a proliferation of streaming services, making content searching difficult. An "aggregator" platform may emerge to re-bundle and simplify content discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>.
*   **Business Models**: While subscription video on demand (SVOD) is prevalent, there are strong examples of advertising-supported models (AVOD) globally, particularly in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>. The future balance between paid and ad-supported content remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.
*   **Content and Competition**: Exclusive content drives competition, leading to massive content budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>. Companies like Apple and Amazon, whose core business models are not content-driven, have different intentions for streaming compared to content-centric companies like Netflix, which could further influence the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>.

## Connectivity Ecosystem
5G technology is being delivered in its standalone form in Australia, posing a significant challenge for telcos in monetizing this infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. This challenge is expected to create new opportunities for other players in the connectivity ecosystem, such as tower companies, hyperscalers, and less traditional entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.

Max, the co-founder of Superpower, emphasizes the importance of ignoring most conventional advice, particularly in fast-evolving fields like technology and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. He asserts that approximately 90% of advice should be disregarded because it is based on past reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Why Conventional Advice is Often Wrong

The relevance of past-based advice has diminished significantly, especially with the rapid advancements in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Predicting the next five years is exceedingly difficult today, unlike 50 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

In the healthcare sector, for example, no "generational healthcare company" like an Apple or Amazon of healthcare currently exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Therefore, relying on what has "worked" in the past is unproductive because, by definition, nothing has truly succeeded on that scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This realization provides a [[importance_of_creativity_and_risktaking | liberating confidence]] to forge a new future, even if it contradicts prevailing opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Contrarian Views and Investment

When seeking capital in the early stages of a startup, founders often pitch to investors who may have a less [[contrarian_thinking_and_controversial_opinions | contrarian view]] of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. While average investors prefer a "mean reverting safe story" and expect founders to echo their own theses, elite investors think differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. They respond positively to novel or interesting ideas, especially those reasoned from first principles, even if they initially disagree with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

However, Max acknowledges the inherent [[importance_of_creativity_and_risktaking | risk]] in this approach: most [[contrarian_thinking_and_controversial_opinions | contrarian views]] are indeed wrong, and the consensus is often correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The key lies in understanding what should exist in the world, starting from a place of emotion and customer needs rather than market logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Superpower's Experience
Max's company, Superpower, has firsthand experience with [[contrarian_thinking_and_controversial_opinions | contrarian beliefs]] proving correct:
*   Three years ago, Max believed that doctors would eventually be replaced by AI and that healthcare would be solved as an informatics problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Many disagreed, emphasizing the "human touch" in medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. However, the rise of large language models like ChatGPT has shown that AI can effectively function as a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. To truly change healthcare, technology capable of processing vast amounts of data is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   Another widely held dogma was that "prevention doesn't work," and people only care about curing sickness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Max believes this is false, citing companies like Neco Health and Prouvo that have achieved significant success by enabling people to take proactive steps for their health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Personal Discarded Ideas
Max often discards ideas and focuses intensely on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. He has increasingly come to:
*   Care less about what others think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.
*   Index less on learning by reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>.
*   Believe there are fewer "requirements" to achieve goals than we perceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>. Max suggests that many self-imposed requirements stem from fear, which he sees as the primary obstacle to achieving what one desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>. He tries to combat this by immediately addressing uncomfortable or uncertain tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>.

## Learning Without Conventional Consumption
Max's learning style has evolved; he consumes less traditional media like podcasts and books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. He found that watching a couple of TV shows in late 2023 taught him more than reading ten non-fiction books, due to his increased real-world context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. His primary modes of learning now include:
*   Watching specific TV shows that act as a "mirror to the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>.
*   Engaging in discussions with a small circle of people who challenge and improve his thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>.
*   Reasoning from first principles and observing the real-time outcomes of his decisions within his company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.
He warns that many people use consuming content as an excuse to delay taking action, often out of fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.

## Principles of Success
Max attributes his success to several key strengths:
*   **First Principles Reasoning**: The ability to fundamentally reason why something should exist, rather than following established dogma or external examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>. This allows for [[contrarian_thinking_and_controversial_opinions | unique beliefs]] and early bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>.
*   **Strong Dot Connecting / Pattern Matching**: The capacity to observe existing information and analogies to derive new insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>.
*   **Interdisciplinary Understanding**: Obsession with learning and intersecting different domains such as technology, design, marketing, consumer psychology, and economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. Max believes understanding the intersection of these fields impacts everything a company does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.

## Looking Ahead: Post-AGI World
Max shares [[contrarian_thinking_and_controversial_opinions | controversial opinions]] about the future in a post-AGI world:
*   **"People Bros" are Underrated**: In a world where information, skill, knowledge, and coding become commoditized, human relationships and the ability to connect with people will remain scarce and vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>. He argues that even top "tech bros" like Sam Altman and Elon Musk are fundamentally "people bros" who understand this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.
*   **Real-World Interface**: Companies that interface with the physical world (e.g., healthcare, deep tech, real estate, space) will become more important as the cost of digital goods approaches zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>.
*   **Decline of Junior White-Collar Roles**: Max is bearish on junior roles in white-collar professions (e.g., lawyers, doctors, accountants, bankers, advertisers) because AI will commoditize much of their "busy work" and skill-based tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>. AI will square any output, meaning 1x contributors will compete with 100x enabled by AI, potentially leading to increased inequality and the need for Universal Basic Income (UBI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. This is antithetical to traditional VC thinking that prioritizes high-gross-margin software businesses, which Max believes will be disrupted first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>. He suggests that businesses with lower gross margins and operational complexity (like Airbnb or Uber) may have stronger moats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>.
*   **The "Magic" of Exponential Output**: Max's word for the year is "magic," referring to identifying high-leverage inputs that can drive 10x or exponential outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. It also refers to exploring "woo-woo" or mystical concepts that might eventually become scientific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:34">[00:52:34]</a>.

Max holds himself accountable for taking more [[importance_of_creativity_and_risktaking | risks]] and maintaining authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>.

Running a business is not always a "rosy road where everything goes up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Founders must be prepared to [[economic_downturns_and_strategies_to_weather_them | navigate crises]] and emerge stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Preparing for Crisis

The key to navigating a crisis successfully is to prepare *before* it happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. It's akin to preparing for a cyclone before it hits, ensuring your bunker is ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. This involves:

*   **Studying Hardship** Reading about others who have endured significant challenges, such as "Man's Search for Meaning" by Victor Frankl or "Endurance" by Shackleton, can teach one to endure far more than they think possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   **Developing a Stoic Mindset** Incorporating principles from stoicism, such as focusing on what can be controlled, is crucial. During a crisis, this means concentrating on actionable steps like caring for customers and strategizing the next move, rather than "sitting there whining about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   **Anticipating Crises** Business leaders should assume that crises will "definitely happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a> and should therefore proactively build an "arsenal of tools" to use when they strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Strategies During Crisis

### The [[impact_of_covid19_on_business_strategy | COVID-19]] Experience

For Payat Travel (now Slice), the [[impact of COVID19 on business strategy | COVID-19 pandemic]] served as a stark example of crisis management. The business, focused on international flights from Australia, saw 95% of its revenue "evaporate" overnight due to border shutdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

During this period, the co-founders focused on what they *could* control:
*   **Customer Care** Ensuring customers received refunds or credits was paramount to protecting the brand's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **Strategic Adaptation** Despite relying on government support (JobKeeper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, they decided to explore expansion. Observing flight scanner data, they noticed significant air traffic in the US compared to Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Within four weeks, they launched in the US, and within three months, they had returned to pre-COVID revenue numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

### Financial Resilience and Risk Management

[[bootstrapping_a_startup_and_managing_financial_risks | Bootstrapping]] a business from the start instills a profound understanding of financial metrics, which is vital during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.
*   **Deep Metric Knowledge** Without external funding, founders must intimately understand their customer acquisition costs, payback periods, and potential losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Personal Sacrifice** The co-founders initially invested their own savings, used personal credit cards, and took out friends and family loans, personally guaranteeing the debt. This meant they were at risk of personal bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. To fund the US expansion during COVID-19, one co-founder sold his car, and the other refinanced his house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

### Balancing Risk and Opportunity

Successful [[entrepreneurship_and_risk_management_strategies | entrepreneurship]] involves intuitively [[prioritization_and_focus_in_business | pricing risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This means:
*   **Regret Minimization** Sometimes, the greater risk is not pursuing an opportunity ("risk of omission") rather than the direct financial loss ("risk of commission") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.
*   **Long-Term View** A long-term perspective often encourages being "risk-on" while simultaneously covering the downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
*   **"Pirate Mode" for New Ventures** For established businesses looking to innovate or expand, adopt a "pirate mode" approach. This means dedicating 95% of effort to upside creation and 5% to downside protection for new products or market expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. This allows for fast, aggressive movement while mitigating absolute critical risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>.

### Learning from Hardship

Crises, while difficult, are defining moments that can build resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   **Thick Skin** Enduring severe challenges, like losing 90% of business overnight, builds "really thick skin" and prepares founders for future adversities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.
*   **Stronger Relationships** A co-founder relationship can be strengthened through shared suffering, as mutual support is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

> "If it works, you're a genius; if it doesn't work, you're an idiot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. The ultimate outcome often dictates the narrative of risk-taking.

### Post-Crisis Growth and Evolution

After securing [[fundraising_and_business_growth_strategies | venture capital funding]], the challenge shifts from pure survival to scalable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.
*   **Balancing Aggression and Professionalism** As a CEO, it's crucial to balance the "hyper-founder mode" of aggressive risk-taking with the professionalism required for a larger organization, ensuring discipline without stifling innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:37:59]</a>.
*   **Instilling Culture at Scale** Maintaining the founding DNA of calculated risk-taking and aggression as the team grows is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. This involves writing down principles and cultural tenets in shared documents (e.g., Notion) to guide decision-making across a larger organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.
*   **Prioritizing Upside Creation** A fast-growing venture business should prioritize upside creation (e.g., 90% focus) over excessive downside protection (e.g., 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>, differentiating itself from more established entities like banks.

> "If you want balance and if you want safety, don't do this. Don't go start a company. It's not good for that... it's 90% pain and 10% happiness if you're lucky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. However, going "all in" often triggers creativity and resourcefulness, increasing chances of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>.

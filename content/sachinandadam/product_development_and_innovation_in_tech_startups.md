Cutable is an AI-powered platform aimed at revitalizing the advertising industry by bringing back the "golden age" of advertising through innovative product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Founded by Jack White, who grew up in the advertising world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, and Sam Krenberg, who previously sold A Cloud Guru for $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, Cutable focuses on combining deep industry insight with cutting-edge AI technology to create effective and engaging advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.

## The Genesis of an Idea

The initial concept for Cutable emerged from Jack White's frustration with traditional advertising agency practices, particularly the lack of attention given to digital channels and the inefficient content production approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. He saw an opportunity to automate the process of repurposing content, moving away from manual methods like chopping down TV spots for social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

Jack began to prototype a system to solve the problem of "cutting up content," which involved clients requesting new videos from hard drives of existing material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. For years, this "crappy system" relied on human editors behind a loading screen that deceptively claimed the video was "now being prepared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. He was focused on solving a specific problem rather than building a scalable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

The pivotal moment for Cutable's product development came when Jack met Sam Krenberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. Sam, who had been exploring AI capabilities like voice models and image generation for a year, recognized that the human-in-the-loop steps in Jack's system could be automated by integrating AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

## The Role of AI and Creativity

Cutable's product development is rooted in the belief that while AI improves, human creativity becomes even more leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Sam notes that his previous venture, A Cloud Guru, succeeded due to its creative element, transforming tech training into an engaging experience with personality and narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This past experience with content as a differentiator eased his transition into the seemingly different world of advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

The founders share a view that everyone possesses creativity, but the difference lies in the technical ability to bring ideas to life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Sam's personal project of building an AI-animated storybook for his kids exemplified this fusion of creativity and technical skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

While AI can replicate existing content or even generate vast quantities of ads, the challenge lies in its ability to truly innovate or "push the state-of-the-art forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. Human connection and appreciation for human effort are innate; an AI-generated video, no matter how real it looks, often doesn't resonate as deeply as human-created content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. This suggests that human-generated content will likely command a premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.

AI acts as a tool to support humans, enabling quicker testing of creative variables and refining the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. The belief is that if creatives embrace AI, it can bring more people into the field, leading to better creatives and ultimately better "craft" in advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

## Focus on Quality and Creative Concept

Cutable's competitive advantage centers on the quality of its ads and its deep understanding of brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. Their philosophy is that the most critical factor for success in advertising is making "better ads" that resonate with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. They view ads not just as transactional messages but as a form of entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.

The company's methodology is modeled on how the best agencies produce ads, ensuring that the AI generates content with a strong creative concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. Instead of optimizing a single ad, Cutable's motto is to create ad sets and let algorithms determine what works best for a specific brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. This approach allows them to learn and understand what resonates with a brand's audience, building a "moat" of proprietary knowledge about the brand's tone of voice and effective concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

Jack dismisses competitors who focus solely on quantity, calling their output "internet garbage that no one wants" because it lacks genuine creative thought and understanding of brand voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. He compares these to "counterfeit" products that might look real but fail when put to the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.

Ultimately, winning in this space requires both quality and quantity, a balance that is difficult to achieve and where no one has yet fully succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

## The Importance of Customer Mindset and Strategic Pivots

Cutable experienced a significant pivot in its product strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. Initially, they were swayed by large brands and their revenue, despite receiving signals that their product wasn't perfectly aligned with these customers' traditional ways of working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. Large companies often have ingrained mindsets that resist adapting to modern advertising models and technological realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>.

A breakthrough occurred during an off-site retreat in San Francisco where the team realized they were deviating from their core vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. They decided to redefine their Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) not by size, but by attitude: seeking customers with an "experimental mindset" and a progressive view of advertising for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.

This shift was validated by interviewing over 50 small to medium businesses who were already building their companies on platforms like Facebook and prioritizing ad effectiveness over traditional constructs like 30-second TV spots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. The pivot was a clear decision, emphasizing the importance of aligning product development with the right customer mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>.

## Process and Collaboration in Product Development

Developing Cutable's product involves a unique blend of advertising expertise and engineering prowess. This requires the company to bridge two very different worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.

*   **Interdisciplinary Teams**: Agency and advertising experts develop new approaches and strategies, often prototyping them using external models. They then rapidly share findings with the engineering team to understand what worked and how to integrate it into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.
*   **Defining Terminology**: A key challenge has been standardizing terminology. Engineers require precise definitions for concepts that advertising professionals might use interchangeably (e.g., "idea" vs. "concept"), leading to the creation of a "bible of words" to ensure clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.
*   **Systemization of Creativity**: Advertising professionals must adopt a more systematic approach, documenting how they arrive at ideas so that the process can be analyzed and made repeatable, rather than relying solely on intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>.
*   **Non-Linear Process**: While the product development process has a clear start (insight) and end (ad), the middle is non-linear and iterative, involving constant checking and refinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>. AI helps by allowing for rapid prototyping and exposure of thinking, connecting disparate parts of the creative process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.

The most challenging problem for Cutable is enabling AI to "recognize a good idea" or a good ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. If AI could reliably identify high-quality concepts, the solution might involve generating vast quantities of ads and then selecting the best ones, rather than focusing solely on creating the perfect ad every time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

## Measuring Success and Future Outlook

Cutable's core focus is on [[Building a successful tech startup | Product-Market Fit (PMF)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>. They prioritize this single metric, which asks customers how disappointed they would be if the product no longer existed, as a rollup of the product's overall value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>.

Quarterly objectives are highly specific and concisely crafted, sometimes just 30 words long, to ensure everyone in the company is aligned and focused on solving one particular problem at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>. This approach optimizes for speed and prevents teams from diverging in different directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.

The founders are driven by their passion for solving complex puzzles and the excitement of the problem they are addressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:15">[01:00:15]</a>. They aim to "create a world where people actually do enjoy watching ads again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:58">[00:58:58]</a>. The collaborative journey with their team is also a significant motivator, providing camaraderie and shared experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>.

[[The balance of risk and ambition in building tech startups | Taking a long view]] on product quality, inspired by founders like Duolingo's, is a deliberate strategic choice for Cutable, even if it means lower initial revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. This requires investors who are aligned with this philosophy and understand the commitment to quality over rapid market share acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. While the long view in a rapidly evolving AI landscape might seem endless, Cutable manages this tension by continuously shipping product and gathering customer feedback while maintaining a high bar for quality before public launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.

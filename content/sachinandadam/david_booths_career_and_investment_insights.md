David Booth is a co-founder and chairman at On Deck and an investor at Blackbird Ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. He has made over 300 investments as an angel investor and through On Deck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## The On Deck Journey

On Deck, co-founded by David Booth, emerged as one of the largest education companies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:55">[01:28:55]</a>. It gained significant traction on Twitter from late 2020 to mid-2021, becoming a "current thing" due to its focus on community during the early pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">[02:20:20]</a>.

### Origins and Pandemic Pivot
On Deck's initial business heavily relied on in-person experiences, which presented a crisis with the onset of the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Instead of canceling, they pivoted to a virtual cohort model, transferring the "magic" of offline retreats, small group dinners, and curated one-to-one connections online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This accidental shift led to the rise of "cohort-based courses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

At its peak, On Deck operated around 37 different individual communities, each serving a specific persona and interlocking to form a "campus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This included:
*   **Founder Fellowship (ODF)**: Bringing together aspiring and existing founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   **Specialized Fellowships**: For product managers, engineers, climate tech, fintech, healthcare, and longevity tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. These targeted professionals not typically self-identifying as founders but operating in specific industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **Adjacent Communities**: Such as On Deck Angels (investors) and OD50 (job seekers), creating a bidirectional flywheel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

### Growth and Challenges
On Deck raised over $100 million to support its ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. They rapidly scaled their team from five pre-pandemic to 200 members in 40 countries, hiring globally based on demonstrated expertise and passion within their communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

The company experienced significant [[startup_growth_and_investor_dynamics | challenges]] and restructuring due to:
1.  **Vaccine Rollout**: People returned to in-person interactions, reducing engagement in digital communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
2.  **Market Shift**: The crypto and tech bubbles collapsed around May 2022, leading to companies cutting learning and development budgets and reduced consumer discretionary spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
3.  **Company Structure**: Ambition led to building many different things, which became unsustainable when market conditions shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. The fund's expected LP capital and management fees dried up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

This necessitated significant layoffs and a strategic scaling down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Some business units were spun out, with teams building independently, such as a talent team forming a new company focused on helping people find jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

### On Deck Today
On Deck has scaled back to its core roots: building relationships offline to grow networks online, anchored back in San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. The current model involves a week-long in-person retreat with 120 experienced or aspiring founders, providing resources and a community to build conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy & Insights

Booth leverages his extensive network and experience to offer [[key_investments_and_experiences_in_venture_capital | investment insights]]. He emphasizes:

*   **The "Golden Rule" of Silicon Valley**: Treat people as if they're the next unicorn founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Being helpful now can lead to future opportunities, whether it's investment, references, or recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
*   **Importance of Networks**: On Deck, AngelList, and New Zealand Venture had been nexus points for networks, allowing Booth to easily connect founders or explore new areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Data Points**: His thousands of conversations with founders across industries and countries provide "raw data points" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This allows him to see common problems and patterns, regardless of specific industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. On Deck's process of pre-application, application, interview, and community participation provided rich [[datadriven_venture_capital_strategies | data points]] for investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

### Founder Motivation Framework
Booth has a framework for understanding what motivates founders, distinguishing between external and internal factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>:
*   **External Negative**: Fear of failure or being laughed at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **External Positive**: Seeking public validation or being recognized as an expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **Internal Positive**: Belief that a problem needs to be solved, driving action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
*   **Internal Negative**: A sense of invalidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

He notes that over-indexing on one quadrant can lead to burnout; a mix of all four is crucial for sustained motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

### Qualities of Best Founders
*   **Hyper-fluency**: An ability to discuss a subject back and forth, leaving others energized and wanting to learn more, regardless of the subject's initial interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This indicates raw intelligence and deep understanding of a space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Intentional Team Building**: For co-founders, building a symbiotic relationship where complementary skills and personalities (e.g., chaos and order) balance each other is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

### Advice for Founders
*   **Build Your Community**: Surround yourself with peers who are a few steps ahead or on the same journey. Seek out "Mastermind groups" or small founder cohorts for shared learning and support, rather than just seeking advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   **Go Global**: For those serious about building a global company, spending time in key global tech hubs like Silicon Valley, London, or Singapore is essential to gain experience and network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

## Personal Reflections & Career Evolution

### Misconceptions and Ambition
David Booth perceives himself as an introvert, despite appearing extroverted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. His desire for structured social gatherings stemmed from a dislike of unstructured ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. He doesn't believe he's "made it" and always looks to the next big thing, viewing past achievements as footnotes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. His ambition is driven by curiosity and a desire to raise the aspirations of those around him, having experienced this personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### Early Entrepreneurial Spirit and Agency
Booth showed early entrepreneurial tendencies, including importing first-generation iPods and reselling them for arbitrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. He also co-founded a clothing brand and ran events during university, intentionally choosing paths outside the conventional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

His parents played a crucial role in cultivating his agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. After a failed venture involving fraudulent iPod Nano imports that led to significant financial loss as a teenager, his parents used it as a teachable moment about concepts like "limited liability company" and encouraged him to "go and build it again," rather than telling him to just get a job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This fostered a mindset of building small businesses rather than just trading time for labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

### Impact of On Deck Journey
The intensity of building On Deck expanded Booth's capacity, likening his brain to a muscle worked to its limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. This experience has given him a "high-capacity brain" capable of "constructively navigating chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. He has grown as a leader, gaining shortcuts and insights from seeing "how the sausage is made," and has become more emotionally intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

He now aims to be intentional about putting family first, building his ambition around his life rather than the reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. He acknowledges that life has chapters (e.g., before/after kids) and that transparency with a partner about intense periods is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. His wife describes him as "unexpected" and "somewhat chaotic," but also now recognizes his straightened priorities and family orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

## Key Relationships

### Eric Torenberg (On Deck Co-founder)
Booth describes his relationship with Eric Torenberg as symbiotic: Booth was the "force of order," while Torenberg was the "force of chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. Torenberg brought energy, challenged them to think bigger and faster, and unlocked networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>. Booth, the "humble Kiwi" who preferred to be behind the scenes, complemented Torenberg's larger public persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>.

### Keith Rabois (Founders Fund)
Keith Rabois, from Founders Fund, led one of On Deck's investment rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Booth describes him as a highly opinionated "force" and one of the best operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>. In a notable Series A decision, On Deck chose Founders Fund over Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), partly because Founders Fund was more flexible on ownership stakes, leaving space for Angel investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. While Rabois was not on the board, Booth later reflected that having a board with diverse skills and investor representation is valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>.

## Return to New Zealand

Booth returned to New Zealand for quality of life reasons and to raise his family, acknowledging the country's values and safety compared to places like San Francisco for young parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

He sees "New Zealand as an identity, not a geography," and views the diaspora of New Zealanders overseas not as a "brain drain" but as individuals gaining invaluable experience in leadership roles at global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>. His current motivation is to understand and connect with this diaspora network, to bring that experience back, paint pathways, and create more role models for future generations of Kiwi builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.

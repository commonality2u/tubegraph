Vinny Pujji is the co-founder of Left Lane Capital, a leading growth consumer investment firm that was rated among the top 25 growth equity firms globally in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Pujji co-founded Left Lane Capital at the age of 27, after six years at Insight Partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Early Career at Insight Partners
Vinny Pujji joined Insight Partners directly after university and spent six years there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. When he joined, Insight Partners was a 60-person firm, which later grew to 120 people by the time he left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. He observed the firm's growth into an institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

### Learning to Invest
Pujji's investing style at Left Lane Capital is very similar to what he learned at Insight Partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Insight's strategy involved an "outbound" approach, where new hires were immediately put on the phones to call companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. This hands-on method involved speaking with thousands of companies a year, leading to learning through trial and error, and understanding different business models and investment fits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. He appreciated this learning method, comparing it to problem-solving like a five-year-old by trying many things and failing quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

Unlike the "elite" VCs in San Francisco who traded deal flow, Insight Partners acted more like "cowboys" who cold-called companies, often investing in bootstrapped businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. Pujji built his own VC network by asking companies who led their previous rounds and then reaching out to those firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. He was often the first or second person from Insight that these firms had met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. He also spearheaded Insight's investing activities in India, going there quarterly to invest in companies like *Chargebee* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. Indian VC firms were initially very open to outside VCs, providing marketing sheets of their portfolio companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

## The Genesis of Left Lane Capital: Insight Next
During his time at Insight Partners, Pujji and a small, four-person team initiated an effort called "Insight Next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. This team focused specifically on investing in early-growth internet companies, a departure from Insight's core focus on late-stage enterprise software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

Pujji found enterprise software to lack innovation, as its models were well-understood for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. Internet companies, however, presented more nuanced business models like freemium, consumer, subscription, or marketplace, and required a different playbook than traditional enterprise sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.

The "Insight Next" team invested in companies such as *The Farmer's Dog*, a pet food company projected to reach over a billion dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>, and *Calm*, the meditation app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>. They also invested in *Chargebee* when it had 2,000 customers, helping it grow to thousands more with a significantly higher average customer payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. The team found unique insights by analyzing usage files, correlating data, and identifying patterns that other investors missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. This led to a high win rate, securing about 90% of the term sheets they offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. They operated as an independent "fund within the fund" with separate pipeline meetings and investment committees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.

## Founding Left Lane Capital
In 2019, due to their strong performance and identified niche, Pujji and his partners negotiated a spin-out from Insight Partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>. Left Lane Capital became a continuation of the strategy developed within "Insight Next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

The name "Left Lane" came from an experience on their way to an LP meeting, where they used the high-occupancy vehicle lane (the "passing lane" in the U.S.) to get ahead of traffic. This symbolized their ability to move faster by being together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.

### Challenges and Responsibilities as a Founder
Pujji was initially "shocked" at the difficulty of starting Left Lane Capital, having taken the infrastructure of Insight Partners for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. He describes having to take on three additional jobs:
1.  **Finding, evaluating, and investing in companies**: This inherently includes winning deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.
2.  **Managing companies**: He prioritizes being responsive to portfolio companies, considering it a failure if he can't respond to an email within a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.
3.  **Building the firm**: This includes hiring, building firm culture, and creating training materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>.

He also notes the significant challenge of fundraising, having met close to a thousand limited partners (LPs) to raise their funds, resulting in about 950 rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>. This experience instilled tremendous empathy for companies raising capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>. Despite the high churn in the industry, Left Lane Capital has maintained its team with no one leaving the firm in over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. Pujji now views his primary role as building the infrastructure to empower others within the firm to become "deal quarterbacks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

### Investment Philosophy: "Utilities"
Left Lane Capital seeks businesses that can become "utilities" â€“ indispensable services that simplify complex or stressful problems for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.

Notable examples of investments that embody this philosophy include:
*   ***Henry***: A company in Australia that automatically calculates and pays taxes and provides automated bookkeeping for sole proprietors, charging one percent of earnings. Pujji notes its incredible retention despite serving single-person businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.
*   **Property Tax Negotiation Company**: Left Lane invested in a company that automatically fights for homeowners to reduce their property taxes, taking a percentage of the savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.

Pujji describes these companies as having high retention rates and addressing a fundamental, often stressful, need for their users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>.

Moses Low is a fintech entrepreneur who grew up in Australia before moving to the United States to participate in Y Combinator, where he has been running his fintech company, Zendit, for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Zendit was the first Indonesian business to go through Y Combinator, which is considered the most prestigious accelerator globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Early Life and Entrepreneurial Roots

Moses Low's [[tim_fungs_entrepreneurial_journey | entrepreneurial journey]] began even before his time, inspired by his grandfather, who started as a stick collector and seller and managed to send nine children to universities overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Growing up between Malaysia and Australia, Moses experienced a pivotal moment at age 13 in Canberra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. His teacher assigned a "life game" where he and a friend became the "doctors" in a village, a monopoly based on a math test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. They leveraged this monopoly to charge high prices, then bought an electronics business, dropping prices to make their competitor bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This experience led his teacher to suggest business as a career path, instilling an entrepreneurial mindset from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Moses's fascination with money began after discovering the capital reserve system, finding it "cool" that private institutions could "print money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This led him to pursue finance and information systems at UNSW, believing technology would be key to owning a bank one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. His first exposure to a startup was Atlassian, whose founders were part of the same scholarship program at UNSW a few years ahead of him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Transition to Management Consulting

After university, Moses decided to enter management consulting at BCG, aiming to learn how to think and run businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. He chose consulting over banking because he was more interested in understanding how businesses operate and how CEOs think, rather than just transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

Consulting provided him with three key benefits:
1.  **How to Think**: It taught him the judicious nature of assessing information and structuring thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
2.  **Humanity of Smart People**: He learned that even highly respected, smart individuals and CEOs make mistakes, which gave him confidence to speak up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
3.  **Self-Awareness**: He realized he was "really bad at politics," which was an honest assessment of his limitations in that corporate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## The Call to Silicon Valley

Moses always had a clear goal to get to Silicon Valley, believing it was "where big ideas are done" and "where big money is raised" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. He felt Australia was too small and that certain cultural aspects made it difficult to do startups there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Rather than going straight into entrepreneurship, which he admitted he was "scared" of, he pursued an MBA at Berkeley as a "risk minimization" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. He realized that as a student in Silicon Valley, he could leverage the "student card" and the immense network, especially from Berkeley, which is a top school for the Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

## Y Combinator Experience

Moses's company, Zendit, was the first Indonesian business to go through Y Combinator (YC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. He described his YC proper experience, which was different from most as he was in Asia and missed many dinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

YC helped him in three main ways:
1.  **Pressure Cooker Environment**: Initially, Zendit felt like "the worst decision YC had ever made" compared to other successful companies in their batch, like a drone delivery company with NASA contracts or a compliant software company growing profits 20% monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This environment forced them to work harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
2.  **Billion-Dollar Founder Advice**: YC provides unparalleled advice from experienced founders who have built successful companies. Justin Kan, who created Twitch, gave them crucial advice on how to pivot, which "changed the trajectory of our lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
3.  **Demo Day Validation**: YC's Demo Day creates a "perfect situation" where startups are perceived as the "hottest company for a day," enabling Zendit to raise capital for an Indonesian business when no one knew about the market in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

Moses also participated in YC Growth, a program for growth-stage companies, which provided intimate group discussions with CEOs of "mega companies" about scaling, hiring, and compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

## The "Cockroach Mentality" and Zendit's Growth

Moses shared his "cockroach story" from living in Indonesia, where his desk was outside the toilet in their small office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This anecdote symbolizes the "cockroach mentality" advised by his mentor, Justin Kan: "survive and do whatever it takes to survive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This mindset is about resilience, scaring off bigger objects, and being functional despite making a "mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

After initial struggles, Zendit found product-market fit and grew rapidly, acquiring 16,000 users in six weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. Their distribution strategy mirrored those of Uber and PayPal: giving away money for free to incentivize user adoption and viral referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. This approach aims to create behavioral change and stickiness before monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

Despite not studying computer science, Moses taught himself to code and built Zendit's website, enabling him to understand developers and have technical conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_startup_ecosystems_silicon_valley_vs_australia | Australia vs. Silicon Valley Startup Culture]]

Moses believes that for an ambitious young entrepreneur, Silicon Valley still offers more advantages than Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

### Advantages of Silicon Valley

*   **Network Effect**: The critical mass of ideas, talent, and capital creates a powerful ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.
*   **Paradigm Shifts**: Being in Silicon Valley helped Moses adopt new ways of thinking, particularly the expectation of pursuing "billion-dollar ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. He recounts an experience with Rob Chandra, a successful VC, who challenged him to only present ideas "worth a billion dollars," which Moses found incredibly empowering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

### Australian Entrepreneurial Attributes

Moses highlights unique Australian qualities that make for good entrepreneurs:

> "We are known for being lazy, which I think actually makes us really good entrepreneurs because we don't like to build things that take time and we don't like to have to do things we don't have to do. So I think when we apply work ethic to our laziness, we actually come up with something pretty cool." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>

He cites the Gallipoli retreat as an example of Australian ingenuity born from the desire to avoid unnecessary work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. Additionally, Australians are less "stuck up" and more willing to be honest about their failures, which fosters humility and a focus on customer needs, avoiding the "facade" seen in some parts of American startup culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.

## Zendit's Vision and the Future of Payments

Zendit is positioned as the "Stripe of Southeast Asia," providing payments infrastructure for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. Their services include accepting payments, facilitating payouts (e.g., payroll, refunds), and holding money (escrow, custodian accounts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. They also build value-added services like data products, KYC (Know Your Customer), and lending based on customer cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.

Moses notes that Zendit benefits from the rising tide of digitalization in Southeast Asia, which has favorable demographics:
*   Fourth-largest country on Earth (Indonesia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.
*   Average age under 30 (50% of the population) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>.
*   Mobile phone penetration above 100%, 80% smartphone penetration, and high internet access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.
*   "Most social cities in the world" in terms of social media usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

He saw a significant opportunity in Indonesia due to extremely poor existing payments infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. There was no single API for accepting payments or for sending money at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. Zendit's pivot into payments infrastructure came from realizing other businesses needed the solutions they had built internally for their own Venmo-style app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.

Looking ahead, Moses predicts continued digitization of cash payments in the region, moving towards bank transfers, e-wallets, or direct merchant payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>. While cash will remain significant for at least 10 years, e-wallets still rely heavily on incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>. Crypto, though originating from a Bitcoin hackathon for Zendit, is currently restricted as a currency in Indonesia, mainly used as an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.

Moses views Zendit as a digital infrastructure business, aiming to build the foundational services (like payments, credit risk, data, KYC, invoicing) that must exist for Southeast Asian economies to become fully digital and service-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. He believes this "boring" but essential space is overlooked, offering a massive opportunity to build multiple "billion dollar companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>.

His personal mission is to foster a "Zendit mafia," inspired by the "PayPal mafia," where early employees go on to build successful, impactful companies that "screw up the world for good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Insights and Advice

Moses shares several insights and pieces of advice for aspiring entrepreneurs:

### Recommended Resources
*   **Book**: "High Growth Handbook" by Elad Gil, which codifies the lessons from YC Growth and is essential for managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.
*   **Podcast**: "Masters of Scale" by Reid Hoffman, offering valuable lessons on scaling businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>.

### Inspirational Figure
He deeply admires Martin Luther King Jr. for his ability to motivate, his character, and his powerful speaking style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.

### Personal Hobbies
To truly relax and detach from work, Moses engages in manual labor, such as converting a garage into a finished space (insulation, electricity, HVAC, roofing), taking apart and rebuilding a car, and gardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>. This fulfills his desire to be handy and not just a "city kid who can't do anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>.

### Formula for Success

> "Success is a function of luck, work ethic, and smarts." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>

*   **Luck**: Acknowledging the role of luck (e.g., being born in a stable country, having education) and that it can be increased by working harder, which creates more opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.
*   **Smarts**: Everyone has "asymmetrical smarts" with an asymptote, meaning there's a limit to how smart one can become in a given area, but it can be improved through hard work, study, and practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>.
*   **Work Ethic**: This is the only factor completely within one's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:23">[00:48:23]</a>. It has a "conflating impact" on the other two: working harder increases luck and makes one smarter (up to the asymptote) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.

This framework teaches Moses to measure himself not on the outcome, but on whether he "tried the best that I can," fostering a "stoic and happy version of startup life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. He emphasizes gratitude for luck and satisfaction when inputs are right, rather than constantly comparing oneself to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>.

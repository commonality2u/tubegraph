Ben Thompson is recognized as a business mastermind behind several companies, including the unicorn Employment Hero, which he scaled from zero to over a billion dollars in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Personal Background and Driving Motivations

Outside of his work, Ben Thompson is a husband and father of three children, aged 19, 16, and 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. He enjoys sailing and identifies as a proud Northern Beaches local, rarely leaving the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. He has worked remotely full-time for about two and a half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Professionally, he holds degrees in economics and law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. For Thompson, his business functions as his hobby, and he enjoys the process of building things, comparing it to playing with Legos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

A common thread throughout Thompson's career has been his love for technology, stemming from his first digital watch, VCR, and Dick Smith computer that required coding to play games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. He is fascinated by new gadgets, technology, and innovations like AI software for image generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. His career path, including economics and law degrees, allowed him to combine his background with technology in his businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. An early inspiration was listening to a radio show about Steve Jobs and Bill Gates battling to build the biggest technology companies in the 1980s, which motivated him to pursue building a large technology company himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

His entrepreneurial journey began with various ventures, including selling citrus fruit from his backyard at a local market, doing paper runs, working and managing a pub during university, and starting a recruitment agency focused on placing ex-politicians into corporate roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. These early experiences provided a "continuum of skills" that allowed him to build more sophisticated businesses over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Founding Employment Hero

Thompson's path to Employment Hero began after working as a trader on the Sydney Futures Exchange, then in derivatives law, mergers and acquisitions, and finally technology law in London during the dot-com boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. After returning to Sydney, he started his own law firm, intending it to be a technology law firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. However, his father, an HR consultant, introduced him to clients who all expressed the same challenge: being an employer was difficult, time-consuming, and carried a significant risk of public scrutiny for even minor errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

This systemic anxiety among small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) about employment, despite SMBs accounting for 99% of businesses and 70% of jobs globally, highlighted a massive "handbrake on the economy" due to friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Thompson realized that 95% of employment processes—recruitment, onboarding, performance management, payroll—are standardized and could be streamlined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This led to the creation of Employment Innovations, a services business that functions as a large HR back-office for SMBs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

The pivotal moment for Employment Hero came after Thompson read "Why Software Will Eat the World" by Marc Andreessen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This article convinced him that any services business not becoming a technology business would be "smashed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. He immediately identified an opportunity to digitize processes, starting with the physical photocopying of welcome packs for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. He then mapped out the product and found Dave Tong, his technical co-founder, who became critical to their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Employment Hero is essentially a digitized version of employment law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_scaling_and_pivoting_startups | Challenges of Scaling]] and Perseverance

Early [[challenges_of_scaling_and_pivoting_startups | challenges of scaling]] Employment Hero included finding product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Initially, the company was too focused on securing revenue and made the mistake of hiring enterprise salespeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. This led to selling too many deals to large companies, whose demands dictated their development roadmap, diverting them from their core SMB focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. One of the hardest decisions was to tell their largest customers that they would no longer support their specific instructions, requiring them to either use the existing product or leave the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

Thompson also faced constant near-bankruptcy during the bootstrapping phase, feeding profits from Employment Innovations and Power to Motivate into Employment Hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. He later learned that a SaaS startup consumes a significant amount of capital due to the upfront customer acquisition costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This realization led him to seek venture debt and later a Series A funding round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

### Darkest Hours and Resilience
Thompson describes facing "a few darkest hours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. One instance involved a significant change in employment legislation (like Work Choices and the Fair Work Act), which caused a drying up of business for months and severely impacted cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. He recalls a moment driving to work, checking his bank account, and realizing they had only $27,000, while payroll was $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

The motivation to keep going stems from the belief that "if you don't get through, you don't get anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. He lives by the quote attributed to Churchill: "When you're going through hell, keep going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. He emphasizes that the constant "firefighting" and "ditches" are not unique to tech founders but are common for all SMB owners globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. This perspective has fueled his passion for building a business that supports SMBs, as "they really need the help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

Despite the challenges, Thompson states he would not do anything differently if given the chance to restart Employment Hero, as he has enjoyed the journey without regrets or unethical actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. He accepts the "ups and downs," believing that without the downs, there are no ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

## The Future of Work

Ben Thompson is a strong proponent of remote and hybrid work. He believes the office will "not ever going to go back to the way it was" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

Based on Employment Hero surveys in 2020 and 2021 across Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, and the UK, 92% (in 2020) and 94% (in 2021) of employees expected to work remotely at least one day a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. He notes that such a high level of agreement on any subject is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

Thompson highlights several benefits of remote work:
*   **Wider Talent Pool**: It allows businesses to recruit from a global talent pool of billions, rather than a limited local radius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.
*   **Social and Moral Superiority**: Remote work supports working parents who need to juggle life and kids, and enables people in rural and remote areas to participate in the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. He cites his Chief of Staff, who lives on a cattle station in rural Australia but can work online with excellent internet access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.
*   **Global Poverty Alleviation**: With global internet access expanding to billions of people currently without it (e.g., via Starlink), remote work can lift them out of poverty by enabling their participation in the online economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.

He criticizes traditional office-based work, comparing skyscrapers to "chicken coops" where people are forced into commutes and artificial environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. He argues that remote work is healthier and more balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

While acknowledging the challenge for young talent in terms of rapid learning and social connection in a fully remote setting, he believes a hybrid model is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. Managers should facilitate learning and social cohesion when teams do gather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. He suggests ideas like a "social network for remote employees" to help connect people within geographic boundaries for social activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

## Navigating Economic Storms

Thompson acknowledges the current shift in the market, where rising interest rates cause money to flow out of speculative technology stocks and back into safer bonds and high-interest assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>. This means less capital, harder fundraising, and a higher bar for company quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

Employment Hero is in a strong position, having completed a $170 million capital raise, providing them with more than three years of runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. They also have the maturity to break even if growth were to slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>. Thompson credits their "best-in-class unit economics" to obsessing over them daily for six to seven years, guided by figures like John Henderson from Airtree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>.

For other startups with limited runway and less robust unit economics, he advises a need to [[challenges_of_scaling_and_pivoting_startups | pivot]] and "do miracles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>. The best advice he has received is to "cut hard and cut early" when faced with difficult decisions like layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.

He offers a note of optimism, suggesting that a recession might lead to lower interest rates due to counter-cyclical forces, potentially making the market less severe than some predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. Australia, in particular, has a history of avoiding recessions when the US is in one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. However, his overall [[advice_on_entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | advice on entrepreneurship]] is to "prepare for the worst, batten down the hatches, have the hard conversations, pivot your model, be conservative, and good luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.

Thompson differentiates the current downturn from the dot-com crash of the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. The dot-com crash was driven by market exuberance and unproven business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>. Today's situation is primarily driven by macroeconomic forces; the underlying SaaS and technology models are not broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>. Companies like Atlassian remain excellent businesses, even if their valuations have decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

## [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_advice | Advice on Entrepreneurship and Startups]]

For young people considering [[entrepreneurship_and_startup_advice | entrepreneurship]] or joining startups, Thompson offers specific [[advice_on_entrepreneurship_and_startup_success | advice on entrepreneurship]]:
*   **Conviction in Ideas**: Pursue ideas based on "first principles" that have been challenged by smart people, and for which you have fundamental belief and passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. Without passion, it's difficult to get through tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.
*   **Understanding Startup Economics**: When joining a startup, understand the "waterfall" on liquidation preferences, as headline valuations might not translate into value for employees if investors have priority in a winding-up scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>.
*   **Commitment**: Be prepared for down rounds and adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. Joining a startup means "you're in business," and it's essential to accept the ups and downs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.
*   **Metrics**: Ask about core SaaS unit economics, such as burn multiple, growth rate, gross margin, and return on customer acquisition cost (CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>. He advises joining startups that fall into the "excellent" bracket based on these metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>.

He emphasizes that "profits matter, not just revenue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>.

## [[leadership_insights_and_lessons | Leadership Insights]]

Thompson attributes his success as a leader to his "vision" and ability to clearly visualize the product he is building in his mind's eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:49">[00:47:49]</a>. This includes knowing "what you're building and why it works," identifying products people will buy, that can be built, and for which there is sufficient market demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>. He considers this ability a fortunate gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.

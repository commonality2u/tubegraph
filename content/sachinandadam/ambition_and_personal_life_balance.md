Emil Michael, former Chief Business Officer at Uber, shares his insights on the complex interplay between intense professional ambition and a fulfilling personal life. His story is detailed in the TV show *Super Pumped* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Navigating the Drive for Success

Michael describes himself as a "hardcore" individual with an intensity that few others possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This drive stems from his background as an immigrant from Egypt, feeling an obligation to take advantage of opportunities his parents didn't have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, and a desire to prove wrong those who doubted his potential, such as a high school counselor who claimed he'd never get into an Ivy League university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

Despite his outward intensity, Michael reveals a "soft spot" for those on his team or those he coaches, particularly those eager to learn and continuously improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. He explains this compassionate side comes from his own life experiences, where one or two people significantly impacted him at different periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The gratification he derives from seeing others achieve great things, like a former HR director becoming a managing partner at a firm, is "almost better than... winning the next deal or doing the next fundraise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. He describes this as akin to [[Balancing Family and Career Success | building family]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## The Aftermath of Peak Professional Intensity

Michael likens the feeling after an intense period of work or a major deal to "post deal depression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. Adrenaline keeps you going, but once it ends, a depressive feeling can set in because you don't feel useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. This period can also bring awareness to physical aches and pains that the mind previously overcame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

After leaving Uber, Michael intentionally pivoted to catch up on personal life that he had postponed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. This included moving his parents to Miami, getting married, and having two children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

Michael offers nuanced advice regarding the timing of personal commitments versus career pursuits:
*   **Individualized Approach** He states that postponing personal life for a career is a "bespoke thing" and he would not generally advise it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **The Provider Instinct** Michael notes that men often have a desire to establish themselves in their careers to feel capable of providing for a family, including parents and other relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
*   **Work Styles** He observes that some intense workers can "shut down at 6:00 and they come back at 9:00 online," while others, like himself, might work continuously through the night and take Saturday afternoons to recover from distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

Since leaving Uber, Michael has actively sought to fulfill personal ambitions, such as showing his parents a good life and having grandchildren, and strengthening family attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>. He also pursued the experience of being a father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.

He redirected his professional ambition by becoming an investor, advisor, and board member, coaching entrepreneurs as Bill Campbell once coached him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>. This allowed him to control his schedule and balance his new family life. While he is currently looking to fill his career ambition again, he acknowledges the ongoing challenge of [[Balancing Work Life and Personal Wellbeing | balancing work life and personal wellbeing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:29">[00:48:29]</a>.

### The Fulfillment of Family

Michael believes that humans are "biologically programmed to want a family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>. The "true moments of joy" come from nurturing a young life, letting them find their own way, make mistakes, and learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:14">[00:49:14]</a>.

He reflects on the historical societal structure of villages, where parents and grandparents lived together, raising children collectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:35">[00:49:35]</a>. Even in modern societies where individuals often leave home for college and work, being near family creates a sense of "humanity" that is "extraordinarily gratifying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. After achieving professional success and experiencing various life events, sharing one's life in a "fancy house" with family becomes a profoundly satisfying experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.

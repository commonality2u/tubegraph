John Henderson, a General Partner at AirTree, one of Australia's largest crypto funds, brings a unique perspective to [[Venture capital and angel investing | venture capital]] and startup evaluation, drawing from his diverse background as a lawyer, consultant, investor, operator, and entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## AirTree's Investment Philosophy: The S-Curve and Deployment Phase

AirTree's approach to innovation curves is characterized by an "S shape," distinguishing between an "installation phase" and a "deployment phase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   **Installation Phase** This is a long, flat bottom period where infrastructure is being built, making tools possible to use, but widespread adoption is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. In the context of crypto, Henderson argues this phase lasted for 11 years, from 2008 to 2019, with only niche use cases like digital gold (though volatile) and illicit activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. ICOs were also seen as a regulatory sidestep, not suitable for [[Venture capital and angel investing | venture fund]] investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Deployment Phase** This is when the curve "ticks up into that vertical part of the S," signifying real-world people starting to use the tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. AirTree aims to invest "just as you hit the deployment phase" to capitalize on the incoming wave of adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. For crypto, the "light bulb moment" was the DeFi summer in early 2020, with the emergence of platforms like MakerDAO, Compound, Aave, and Yearn Finance, indicating real usage of a new financial ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

While acknowledging the speculation and mania often associated with crypto, Henderson believes a "rising tide" is lifting all boats, with "real things being built and real usage occurring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

## Identifying "Rocket Ships": AirTree's Investment Criteria

AirTree seeks out "rocket ships" â€“ fast-growing companies and sectors that offer significant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.
*   **Focus on Unique Strength:** Instead of looking for an absence of weaknesses, AirTree focuses on "specific strength" or "something unique" in a startup, most often found in the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. They acknowledge that young entrepreneurs are "generally crap at almost everything," which is acceptable as long as there's a unique compelling factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
*   **Case Study: A Cloud Guru:** AirTree invested in A Cloud Guru before the company officially started, backing founder Ryan, who began a YouTube channel teaching AWS certification after being rejected by AWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. Ryan's "manner and knack," technical talent, huge audience, and the "chip on his shoulder" from rejection were key unique strengths that led to the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>. This contrasts with backing someone simply with a traditional corporate background, emphasizing the importance of a "real reason for starting that exact company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.

## Venture Capital's Role: Supporting Entrepreneurs

Henderson holds a humble view of the [[Venture capital and angel investing | venture capitalist's]] role. He states that VCs are "just lubricant" for entrepreneurs to achieve their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. While VCs provide "rocket fuel to power their ambitions" and can offer services like recruiting or publicity, they are not the "kingmaker" or "decision maker" that media often portrays them to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>. The fundamental role is to identify entrepreneurs who know the answers and can disrupt industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

## The Evolving Landscape of Venture Capital

The [[navigating_venture_capital_and_startup_ecosystems | venture capital scene]] is experiencing significant shifts:
*   **Tiger Global's Impact:** Tiger Global has influenced the [[Venture Capital Strategies and Deal Winning | venture capital scene]] by emphasizing speed and price as key factors for entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>. Their rapid deal-making and high valuations have "raised what table stakes are" for other firms, forcing them to match on speed and terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:29">[00:46:29]</a>. This increased competition is seen as beneficial for entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>. Once firms match on these basic elements, other differentiators like brand, recruitment support, and portfolio infrastructure become important again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.
*   **Emergence of Solo Capitalists:** Solo capitalists, such as Harry Stebbings, are a growing category in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. They offer unique value, like Harry's extensive international network and large podcast audience, making them attractive to founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>. However, a challenge for solo capitalists is how they will scale their support for a growing number of portfolio companies (e.g., from 10-30 to 100), as a one-to-one "white glove service" model leads to diminishing returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.

## Thematic Investment Interests

Beyond crypto/web3, AirTree is passionate about investing in several key themes:
*   **Climate Tech:** A strong focus area, with personal investments and an interest in projects like KlimaDAO, which bridges carbon credits on-chain to raise their price and contribute to global warming reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.
*   **Creator Economy:** This involves tools and systems for creators and companies that are becoming smaller and more niche as people find their "thousand true fans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>. An example is Linktree, which evolved from a simple link-in-bio service to enable commerce and compete with platforms like Wix and Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.
*   **Cybersecurity:** Given the expanding "surface of the internet," protection is increasingly vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## Supporting Portfolio Companies: The Network Model

To address the challenge of scaling support as their portfolio grows (from 85 to an anticipated 110 companies), AirTree is building a "portfolio services function" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>. This team aims to get portfolio companies "working with themselves," facilitating monthly forums for CEOs, CFOs, CTOs, and other leaders to share experiences, learn best practices, and build a strong network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. This "network model" offers increasing returns as the portfolio grows more impressive and experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>.

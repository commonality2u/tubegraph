Frank Reef, a 31-year-old former modest chef who sold his real estate tech company, Real Base, for $180 million, offers unique insights into [[the_balance_of_work_and_personal_life_for_entrepreneurs | balancing success and personal fulfillment]] in entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. His journey, which began at age 20, challenges traditional startup archetypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Beyond "Balance": Embracing Seasons and Harmony

While Frank's life may appear remarkably structured and balanced to outsiders, he emphasizes that consistent balance is a myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. He views the entrepreneurial journey as a series of "seasons" where things can become completely out of balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. He cautions against those who sell the dream of constant balance or perpetual "hustle culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Frank believes that trying to run at 100% all the time inevitably leads to burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. His long-term approach, spanning 12 years with his company, required him to figure out how to maintain a consistent energy output and identify his non-negotiables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Frank prefers the term "harmony" over "balance," recognizing that while life is never perfectly balanced, one can still achieve a sense of integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### The "Hunter" Mentality for Creative Work
Frank aligns with the concept of working like "hunters" rather than "sheep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This approach involves periods of intense "sprint" followed by genuine "rest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. He suggests this is particularly effective for creative work, emphasizing the importance of giving oneself space to rest during different seasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Frank's Pillars of Harmony

Frank's approach to [[navigating_worklife_balance_as_a_startup_founder | navigating work-life balance as a startup founder]] is rooted in a remarkably structured and intentional lifestyle, developed over time by learning what he needs to be his best self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. He focuses on a smaller number of things to achieve what he calls "balance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

His core non-negotiables are:
*   **Business** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>
*   **Family/Friends** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>
*   **Health and Fitness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>

He strategically integrates these areas, such as training with a friend at 5 AM to combine social activity with fitness, and having his son present during his workouts to integrate family time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. He discovered that morning training is crucial for him to avoid mental "cobwebs" and perform at his best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. His daily structure primarily revolves around training, work, spending time with his wife, and sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## The Role of Relationships and [[personal_growth_and_work_life_balance | Personal Growth and Work Life Balance]]

A significant factor in Frank's ability to maintain harmony is his long-term relationship with his wife, Holly, whom he has been with since age 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. He highlights the profound impact of growing together as individuals and having a partner who has known him every step of the way, serving as a sounding board with no ulterior motive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of a supportive partner in [[balancing_career_and_family_for_women_in_business | juggling parenthood and entrepreneurship]], noting that such a relationship can "level you up" and isn't just about the romantic aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

Frank also reflects on the hypothetical choice between career success and personal connection at 80 years old, stating that he would prioritize having someone to share his life with over accumulated wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. He suggests that being ambitious and striving, combined with a social layer, can make one more attractive and avoid sacrificing relationship opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Post-Exit and Future Outlook: Purpose Beyond Profit

After selling his business, Frank took a moment for deep self-reflection, creating a cookbook for charity to ensure his next steps were not solely driven by continuous business ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>. While acknowledging the importance of money as a measure of success in business, he now seeks ventures that offer fulfillment and purpose that cannot be obtained from cash alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>. He is driven by the desire to "go again" and apply lessons learned to compress timelines for success, seeking to create both commercial viability and significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>.

Frank finds inspiration in models like TLC (Tender Loving Care), a business that integrates social impact into its supply chain by employing people with disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>. This approach generates fulfillment from business success and a greater impact as the business grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>. He aims for his next venture to be rooted in impact, in an industry that excites him and allows for commercial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.

Frank acknowledges the "hedonic treadmill," where achieving goals quickly leads to a new baseline, highlighting that numbers alone are unfulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. True meaning, he believes, comes from things that truly ground you, like impact, people around you, and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>.

## Self-Reflection and Mental Clarity for [[balancing_stress_and_happiness_as_a_founder | Balancing Stress and Happiness as a Founder]]

Frank engages in an "ungodly amount" of self-reflection, incorporating journaling and conscious thinking to process experiences and improve continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. He records conversations, analyzes his performance, and consciously seeks ways to do better in every interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

He also shares a surprising aspect of his internal monologue: it's almost silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:14:08]</a>. This is because most of his processing happens subconsciously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>, contributing to his low stress levels and ability to respond quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:23">[01:15:23]</a>. He learned to consciously bring subconscious thoughts into his awareness to process them, especially after experiencing insomnia due to unconsciously hyper stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>. This disciplined approach to [[balancing_work_life_and_personal_wellbeing | personal well-being]] allows him to maintain mental clarity amidst intense entrepreneurial endeavors.

## Alex Honnold's Observations
[[Alex Honnolds transition from climbing to climate change | Alex Honnold]], a professional climber and founder of the Honnold Foundation, has observed numerous physical signs of [[climate_change_and_storytelling | climate change]] during his extensive travels and climbing expeditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. While he started his foundation focusing on solar projects for [[combating_climate_change_through_investment | environmental reasons]] and improving human living standards before witnessing many direct physical impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>, his subsequent experiences have solidified his concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

Key observations include:
*   **Glacial Retreat** The most obvious signs for Honnold are the widespread glacial retreats across the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **Disappearing Ice Climbs** He has seen "ice climbs that don't form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. For example, he hiked to climb an ice route in Patagonia, only to find it had "melted out the year before and basically fallen down and was now just gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. This former "several hundred foot pillar of ice" is unlikely to ever reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.
*   **Changing Mountain Access** In Southern Argentina and Patagonia, a premier climbing destination, a glacier retreated so significantly within two to three years that it altered the standard approach to the mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. The glacial lake at the terminus is now "twice as big as it used to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>, forcing climbers to change their routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

Honnold finds these changes "pretty sobering," especially when contrasting the perception of "giant mountains that feel like geologic scale where you're like oh these are Timeless" with the "severe enough" year-over-year changes that "changes the way you interact with the mountains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

### Impact of Energy Poverty
Through his expeditions and travels, Honnold has also observed the severe impact of energy poverty on human communities, particularly in tropical regions without access to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. He notes that "people live in the dark for 12 hours a day," which significantly reduces their "productive time" and what they can achieve with their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. This understanding reinforced his belief that environmental protection is intrinsically linked to meeting basic human needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

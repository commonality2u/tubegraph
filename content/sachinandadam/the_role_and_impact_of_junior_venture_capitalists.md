Tim Doyle, founder of Eucalyptus, offers a critical perspective on the role and impact of junior [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | VCs]] in the Australian [[startups | startup]] ecosystem. He states his belief that "99% of Australia junior [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | VCs]] add no value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>. While acknowledging this is a "hot take," he argues that the model for junior [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | VCs]] to become valuable members of [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | venture capital]] firms is "fundamentally broken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.

## Critiques of the Junior VC Model

Doyle outlines several reasons for his critical assessment of junior [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | VCs]]:

### Interaction with Companies
*   **Entry Point:** The job of interacting with many companies as an entry point into the firm is considered a "terrible idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. Founders may put junior [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | VCs]] on a pedestal, expecting them to provide insights, but a 22-year-old may not have the necessary understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>.
*   **Bad Advice:** Young people trying to find their footing often give "a lot of bad advice" to early-stage founders, which is seen as "terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.

### Portfolio Company Analysis
*   **Lack of Training:** Junior [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | VCs]] are frequently assigned as analysts for portfolio companies, expected to gain deep understanding, but they have "no training" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>. This leads to them asking "really dumb questions" to founders, creating a frustrating experience for the [[startups | startups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

### Learning Process and Decision Making
*   **Insufficient "Reps":** Doyle questions whether junior [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | VCs]] truly learn the decision-making processes required to be effective [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | venture capital]] investors, as they "don't think they get the reps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. The "reps" they do get are described as "really weird" because good opportunities are often taken over by more senior partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:58">[00:53:58]</a>.
*   **Lack of Operator Perspective:** Junior [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | VCs]] rarely experience the [[transition_from_venture_capital_to_entrepreneurship | operator]] side of a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. Their understanding of what is important is often derived from reading blogs rather than practical experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>.
*   **Apprenticeship Model Flaws:** While the "apprenticeship model is the way to do it," its design is "terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>. Unlike investment banking analysts who work unseen for a long time, young [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | VCs]] are often put in public roles, such as speaking on panels, too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>.

## Suggested Alternatives and Better Paths
Doyle advises young people considering a career as a junior [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | VC]] to "build something" instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>. He suggests:
*   **Sharing Opinions:** "Get out there, share opinions, get feedback" in an unprotected way, similar to writing a blog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>.
*   **Working for a Builder:** Even if not building their own company, working for someone who is building something allows for direct involvement in the "grind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>. For example, working in an [[operator | operations]] team moving medication around the country offers insights into trade-offs, complexity, and patient experience that are more valuable for assessing businesses than a typical junior [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | VC]] role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Career Building:** Optimizing for financial returns from a capital perspective is a "long road" and not necessarily a good way to build a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>.

## Overall Impact
Doyle acknowledges that many [[venture_capital_and_startup_evaluation | VCs]] in Australia, particularly the big ones, have been "really ambitious" and "supportive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>, contributing positively to the ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>. However, he believes there is a need for more exposure to and learning from "senior [[transition_from_venture_capital_to_entrepreneurship | operators]]" rather than focusing solely on "founder worship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.

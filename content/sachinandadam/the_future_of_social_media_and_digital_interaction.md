Rex Woodbury, a venture capitalist at Index Ventures and author of "Digital Native," emphasizes his fascination with how [[the_intersection_of_technology_and_human_behavior | human behavior]] and culture intersect with technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. He views this intersection as the core driver for his interest in technology and venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## New York: A Metaphor for the Internet

Woodbury describes New York City as a metaphor for the internet, highlighting similarities in their wild, chaotic, and diverse nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Both are a "collision of humanity" and a place for "outcasts or people who didn't belong elsewhere" to find community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Just as people go to New York to seek belonging, individuals use platforms like Reddit, Discord, and Instagram to find their "people" or "tribe" online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. This ability to find connection and belonging is what draws Woodbury to both the city and the digital age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

## The Digitally Native Generation: Gen Z

Gen Z is identified as the first truly "digitally native" generation, unlike previous generations who adopted mobile technology later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. This generation has an immense amount of time and engagement dedicated to technology, the internet, and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

### Optimism vs. Cynicism

Woodbury maintains a "perpetual Tech Optimist" outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. He acknowledges historical anxieties surrounding new technologies, from TV rotting minds to the printing press eroding human memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. Despite potential negative externalities, he believes that technology ultimately nets out to the positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

He highlights positive impacts:
*   The internet's ability to make the world global and introduce new people and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.
*   The growth of organizations like 'Worthy,' which matches LGBTQ+ mentors with mentees, demonstrating how social media (Instagram) facilitates community and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
*   The internet's role in helping individuals with niche interests find belonging, illustrated by Jack Conte of Patreon's perspective that with billions online, millions can share even highly specific interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.
*   New technologies, including generative AI, contribute to easier and better human knowledge and creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.

### The Impact on Mental Health and Attention

While optimistic, Woodbury acknowledges the strong correlation between smartphone/social media adoption and the decline in mental health among teen girls since 2009-2010, marked by increased depression and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. This issue is attributed to certain product decisions within social media platforms that encourage addictive properties and specific types of content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. He suggests that time spent online may come at the expense of rich offline connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

This observation informs the emergence of a new wave of consumer apps like BeReal and Gas, which focus on fostering more authentic or closer relationships, moving away from broad, wide networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. He notes that the next social network might resemble a game, blurring the lines between creation and play, similar to Minecraft or Roblox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. However, the ad-driven business models of current platforms often don't align with these types of authentic interactions, potentially requiring policy intervention to curb excesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.

### Changing Trends in Online Attention

A significant shift in online attention is noted:
*   Less time is spent interacting with traditional friends and acquaintances (social media 1.0 like Facebook and Instagram) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
*   More time is dedicated to meeting strangers and engaging in "parasocial relationships" through platforms like TikTok, Discord, and Reddit, typically centered around shared interests or connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.

This merging of social networks, entertainment, and the [[the_future_of_work_and_remote_working | creator economy]] is creating a unified online experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>. Examples include Fortnite, where social interaction happens unconsciously through gameplay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.

### The Creator Economy and New Ways of Working

Woodbury prefers to broaden the definition of the "creator economy" to encompass "digitally native work" or "job creation platforms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. He highlights how platforms like Amazon and YouTube enable vastly more people to earn a living as third-party sellers or content creators than they directly employ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>. This represents inspiring new ways to make a living and dictate one's own path online, a significant departure from the traditional nine-to-five corporate structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

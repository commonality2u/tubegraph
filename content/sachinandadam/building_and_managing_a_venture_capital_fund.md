Elizabeth Yin, co-founder of Hustle Fund, one of America's most well-known pre-seed funds, shares her extensive experience as an entrepreneur and venture capitalist, offering insights into [[life_as_a_founder_and_venture_capitalist | investing and founding companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Genesis of Hustle Fund
Elizabeth Yin's motivation for co-founding Hustle Fund stemmed from a desire to build a "huge business" that could be her "life's work" for 30 to 40 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Having been a founder herself, she realized her passion lay with founders and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. She identified three major problems founders often face: lack of capital, knowledge, and networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Hustle Fund's mission is to empower great founders by providing access to capital, knowledge, and networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. While often seen primarily as a VC fund, their goal is to do much more than just provide capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Entrepreneurial Roots
Elizabeth's path into startups was largely influenced by growing up in Silicon Valley during the dot-com boom in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. She doesn't believe being a founder is hereditary but rather a byproduct of time and place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Her first direct experience with a startup was during winter break in 1996, helping a friend's cousin, Tony, build chairs, tables, and even make ethernet cables by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This chaotic yet energetic environment, where people ate pizza and worked on their website, left a strong impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This company later sold to Microsoft for purported "couple hundred million bucks," and Tony was the late Tony Hsieh, previously CEO of Zappos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### Self-Awareness and Frugality
Elizabeth identifies self-awareness as her superpower, knowing where she has an edge and where she doesn't, and choosing "games" where she can win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. She believes perseverance and hard work aren't enough; one must consider what game to play that offers joy and fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Her strengths include frugality and resourcefulness, making things happen on a limited budget or time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This frugality proved a perfect attribute for starting a pre-seed fund, where operations typically involve very little money and returns take 10 to 15 years, often not as much as in traditional finance or large tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Transition to [[venture_capital_and_angel_investing | Investing]]
Her move into investing was gradual, starting at 500 Startups as a mentor and advisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. She then ran their accelerator program for almost three years, overseeing 200 investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. This provided "investing lessons on steroids," much faster than traditional VC or angel investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. She suggests that working at an accelerator is one of the best ways to learn to invest, as it offers many "reps" and a quicker feedback cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.

## Building a Differentiated Fund
When starting Hustle Fund in 2017, Elizabeth and her business partner Eric Bond realized they were entering a crowded market with thousands of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. They went through about 20 iterations of their pitch to differentiate themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.

### The Hustle Fund Model
The core of their differentiated pitch, the 20th version, highlighted the scarcity of capital for truly early-stage, pre-seed founders who don't have "a rich Uncle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.
Their model involves:
*   **Global Investment:** Investing in many companies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>.
*   **Small Initial Checks:** Providing small checks (e.g., $25K) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>.
*   **Active Engagement & Follow-on:** Working closely with founders, and then doubling down at the seed stage in about 20% of cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>. This allows them to deploy capital based on working with founders rather than just their pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>. This model was developed from observations made during accelerator programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>.

### Qualities of Successful Founders
Hustle Fund looks for "speed" in founders, which is why the fund is named "Hustle Fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>. The more experiments or "shots on goal" a founder gets within a limited runway, the higher their likelihood of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
Key attributes of their best founders include:
*   **Ability to De-risk Quickly:** Quickly figuring out and executing experiments to de-risk ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.
*   **Learning Ability:** Rapidly learning new skills, as CEOs need to wear many hats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>.
*   **Charisma/Team Building:** Attracting a great team to compensate for weaknesses, even with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>.
*   **Prioritization:** Focusing on the "number one thing" to figure out in the next 2-4 weeks and letting everything else drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.
*   **Frugality:** Stretching runway and dollars, convincing talent to work for equity over high salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.
*   **Sales Skills:** Not just selling to customers, but also selling the vision to the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>.

## Managing the Fund and Operations
Hustle Fund employs about 30 people, which is considered large for its fund size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. This is possible because they have other business lines that generate revenue, allowing them more resources to help founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.

### Scaled Processes and Culture
To manage a large portfolio and provide support, Hustle Fund has built extensive systems and processes, some with technology, to streamline operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. For example, running workshops allows them to work with many founders at once who share common problems like raising money or customer acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>.

Elizabeth emphasizes that building a great organization requires significant attention to:
*   **Culture:** Ensuring new hires fit the company's personality and values, such as kindness at Hustle Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This means delaying hiring to find the right fit and actively "marketing" to potential job candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.
*   **Operations and Processes:** Constantly improving scaled processes and leveraging technology, which is often ironic for VCs who invest in tech but don't always incorporate it into their own operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.

### Branding and Customer Acquisition for a Fund
Hustle Fund approaches building its brand like a startup, focusing on "customer acquisition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>. Although they don't sell a product for dollars, they aim to build a brand that attracts founders to take their investment, with the ultimate "payment" coming from successful exits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:25">[00:47:25]</a>.

Their strategy involves:
*   **Experimentation:** Conducting many customer acquisition experiments across various channels (e.g., Clubhouse, TikTok, YouTube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. Many experiments fail (e.g., TikTok efforts were "dead") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.
*   **Data-Driven Focus:** Doubling down on channels that show results. For Hustle Fund, Twitter proved highly effective, with over half of company applications coming from the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. They then "brute forced it" for 6-12 months, tweeting daily and analyzing data to find effective topics, leading to a repeatable process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.

# Further Learnings

*   **Learning to Invest:** Making many investment decisions, both "yay or nay," and experiencing a tight feedback loop helps in improving investment skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. Traditional VC funds often lack this tight feedback loop due to long cycles (5-15 years for outcomes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.
*   **Exit Strategy:** The right time to exit a company is a complex decision, often based on whether the company is on the right trajectory to continue winning (professional side) and personal factors like cultural fit or jadedness with the industry (personal side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
*   **The Lean Startup:** Elizabeth cites "Lean Startup" as one of her favorite books due to its significant impact on how she builds businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.
*   **Inspiration:** Elizabeth would want to have dinner with Warren Buffett, appreciating his life and professional learnings, especially his early adjustments in investing and the impact of "time and place" on market opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

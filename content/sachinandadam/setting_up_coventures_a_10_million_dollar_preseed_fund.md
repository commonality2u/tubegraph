## About Maxine Minter

Her announcement of Coventures on LinkedIn generated "thousands of likes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> and "made a lot of waves in an ecosystem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, validating the demand for early-stage support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Her career path has included various roles such as an executive coach, [[Venture capital perspectives and founderfirst investing | VC]], [[Venture capital and angel investing | angel investor]], founder, lawyer, and studying at Stanford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. A consistent "thread connecting all those things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> is her purpose to "accelerate people and sort of boost people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, finding "much more joy out of accelerating other people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Motivation for Starting Coventures

Maxine identified several key reasons for launching Coventures:

*   **Commercial Opportunity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>: She saw a "huge opportunity in the Australian Market to own the pre-seed stage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>, noting that no other fund was specializing in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>. She compared this to what First Round Capital did for the seed stage in the Bay Area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.
*   **Impact Opportunity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>: Coventures aims to "accelerate the next generation of Australian unicorns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>, which would bring "all kinds of career wealth life opportunities for all of the people that are part of those" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a> companies.
*   **Economic Impact for Australia** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>: The startup ecosystem has grown significantly, becoming the "sixth largest employer in Australia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>, and Maxine believes it's "only getting started" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:49:57]</a>, offering an opportunity for "opportunity creation and wealth creation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.
*   **Influence and Role Models** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:19">[00:50:19]</a>: Inspired by a friend, Maxine realized there hadn't been an Australian woman who had [[Building a Successful Venture Capital Fund OIF | raised a fund]] by herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. She believes her venture will encourage more people to "start a fund" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a> or scale their [[Venture capital and angel investing | angel investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.

> "The intersection of all of those things together is just like it was a no-brainer it had to be done." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>

## Strategy and Competitive Edge

Maxine believes "good strategy wins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>, defined as a "differentiated customer Insight supported by a Superior Financial model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.

She highlights that:
*   Raising pre-seed capital in Australia is "really hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>, and data shows that pre-seed and [[Venture capital and angel investing | angel investing]] rounds are not correlated with seed rounds, suggesting a lack of "fully integrated actors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a> in the institutional pre-seed space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.
*   The Australian ecosystem receives "a 17th of the amount invested per GDP" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a> compared to the US, making it "a very underfunded ecosystem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.

Coventures' thesis is to "find companies in those ecosystems and accelerating them to the US" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>, leveraging both a "stage Arbitrage and then an ecosystem Arbitrage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:23]</a>. Maxine notes that while there are people writing pre-seed checks, "no one's doing it as a like thoughtful stage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>. She believes her experience of learning to [[Investing in startups and earlystage companies | invest]] in the US, where the pre-seed ecosystem is more developed, gives her a unique advantage in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:28">[00:54:28]</a>.

The fund's strategy is built on competitive moats that will compound over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>, aiming to be the "first person to do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a> and demonstrate its viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>.

Coventures is currently still [[Building a Successful Venture Capital Fund OIF | raising capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:47">[01:17:47]</a>.

## Notable Achievements and Experiences

### The Spycatcher Trial
One of the most instructive episodes in Turnbull's younger life was the Spycatcher trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This legal battle, which he took on at age 31 with Lucy Turnbull, was a "classic sort of David and Goliath battle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Despite being given "literally no chance of success" against the British government and their expensive legal team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, they won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Lessons learned from the trial included:
*   Not being intimidated by people with big titles or pretensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   Paying attention to detail, particularly in interlocutory proceedings and discovery, which helped build their case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

The Spycatcher case gave Turnbull "enormous profile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, as he won what was considered the biggest lawsuit in Australia at 32 years old, and a major international case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The case involved spies, the British government, a cabinet secretary misleading the court, and embarrassment for Mrs. Thatcher, making it a compelling story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Transition from Law to Business
After his significant legal victory, Turnbull decided to transition from law, feeling that further legal cases might be an anti-climax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. He had always wanted to try his hand in the business world, specifically in deal-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. This led him to set up a very successful investment banking business that operated for a decade before being sold to Goldman Sachs in 1997, where he became a partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

### Entering Public Life
Following his success in finance, Turnbull entered public life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. As Prime Minister, he maintained a sense of self and managed stress by prioritizing physical rest to avoid exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. He enforced a "golden rule" in his office: "Don't kill the candidate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>, emphasizing the need for politicians to be well-rested to perform effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. Turnbull rarely experienced sleepless nights, attributing his good sleep to simple practices like eating smaller dinners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

One of his major achievements on the renewables front as Prime Minister was Snowy Hydro 2.0, designed to make thousands of megawatts of renewables reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.

### The Republican Movement
Turnbull headed the Australian republican movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. He believes that the issue of Australia becoming a republic will likely not be a front-burner topic until after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. He sees Australia having the British monarch as its head of state as "completely anomalous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>, arguing that Australia, as a thoroughly independent country, should have an Australian citizen chosen by Australians as its head of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. This change, he believes, would enhance Australia's standing internationally and align better with its evolved modern values and traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

### Insights on Success and Leadership
Turnbull attributes his success to being very determined and relentlessly focused on tasks, and not getting disheartened easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. He advises young people to believe in themselves, be ambitious, and be diligent, and not to be discouraged by setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. He also stresses the importance of quantitative skills, digital literacy, and a willingness to ask questions and learn from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. His top skill for a leader to develop is listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

Canva's exponential growth and success, leading to its valuation at nearly $40 billion, can be attributed significantly to its strategic use of word-of-mouth and influencer marketing, alongside effective grassroots campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This approach was crucial in building a loyal user base and expanding its reach without initial heavy reliance on traditional advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Word-of-Mouth and Influencer Partnerships

Canva strategically partnered with various groups to spread awareness and adoption of its product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>:
*   **Educators** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>
*   **Industry professionals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>
*   **Influencers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>

This enabled users to receive messages about Canva from trusted sources, fostering greater adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The grassroots marketing approach generated substantial community engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### User-Generated Content and Virality
A key indicator of community engagement was the prevalence of user-generated content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Early adopters frequently created their own templates and designs that their audiences would then use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This created a funnel where influencers using Canva would create content that their audiences would consume and share, leading to a cascading effect of adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Canva's understanding of how to properly conduct grassroots marketing, including leveraging influencers to create templates for their audiences, was a significant factor in creating this virality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Targeting Specific Audiences

Canva demonstrated a keen understanding of targeting the right audiences for maximum impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Educational Institutions:** Canva was offered for free to educational institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Students as Advocates:** This strategy led to many students becoming highly loyal customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. As these students transitioned into the workforce, they became advocates for Canva in their respective professional environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

This combination of strategic partnerships, fostering user-generated content, and targeting key demographic groups like students, ensured that Canva's growth was driven by genuine user advocacy and a strong community, rather than solely by paid advertising campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

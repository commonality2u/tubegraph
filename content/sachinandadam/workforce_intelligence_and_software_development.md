[[Artificial Intelligence and Workforce Transformation | Artificial Intelligence]] is driving a significant shift in technology, enabling individuals from any background to build software without formal training or degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This transformation highlights the growing importance of [[Workforce Intelligence and Software Development | Workforce Intelligence]], a category focused on using data to make informed and fair decisions about workforce allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

## The Core Problem: Lack of Workforce Visibility

Many organizations, regardless of size, lack fundamental knowledge about their workforce. They know names and ID codes for payroll purposes but don't understand employees' skills, potential, or workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Companies often know more about their office equipment than their own people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

Another critical gap is the lack of clarity on what work is actually being done. A job title is often described for marketing, but the underlying tasks are what truly matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This disconnect prevents organizations from effectively mobilizing their workforce and matching the right work to the right worker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## AI's Impact on the Workforce

[[Artificial Intelligence and Workforce Transformation | AI]] does not automate skills, but rather automates tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This distinction is crucial for organizations implementing [[AIdriven productivity tools in government and enterprises | AI]] within their workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The current period represents a once-in-a-generation change to work, with every company undergoing massive transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Many organizations are unsure where to implement [[AIdriven productivity tools in government and enterprises | AI]] and what its impact will be on individual jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The future jobs are not yet known because their creation depends on the implementation of [[Artificial Intelligence and Workforce Transformation | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The pace of [[Artificial Intelligence and Workforce Transformation | AI]] acceleration is expected to be three times faster than currently perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## Reig's Solution: Workforce Intelligence

Reig's mission is to help organizations understand their workers and the tasks involved in work, enabling them to move work to the right worker seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. This includes leveraging full-time employees, consultants, or [[Rise of AI agents and their impact on the workforce | AI as a digital worker]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

Reig's platform uses ontologies to understand every job at a task and skill level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This allows companies to be bold in embracing [[Artificial Intelligence and Workforce Transformation | AI]] while being responsible and ensuring no one is left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The company aims to create a world with zero waste of potential by helping organizations rethink company building and reskilling people into meaningful work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

## Building an AI-Driven Company

Reig, itself an [[The evolving role of AI in software engineering and product management | AI company]], applies its workforce optimization expertise internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The goal is to build a billion-dollar company with under 100 people by completely transforming the workforce strategy using [[Artificial Intelligence and Workforce Transformation | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

### Internal AI Adoption
Reig has seen significant productivity gains from its own [[AIdriven productivity tools in government and enterprises | AI adoption]], saving \$1.5 million per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. This includes using [[AIdriven productivity tools in government and enterprises | AI]] in:
*   **Go-to-market strategies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>
*   **Customer support** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>
*   **Product development** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>
*   **Sales Development (SDR) work:** Automating 80% of sales reps' message sending tasks, then reintroducing human involvement for authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Personal Productivity with AI
The founder utilizes about 30 [[Rise of AI agents and their impact on the workforce | AI agents]] trained on her voice and tone for various tasks:
*   Content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>
*   Investor reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>
*   Customer communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>

## Enterprise Sales Strategies

Successful [[Hiring strategies and identifying talent | Enterprise sales]] requires deep empathy and subject matter expertise for the customer's problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. It's about solving problems with clients, not just selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

Key principles include:
*   **Investing in Subject Matter Experts:** Hiring individuals with deep industry knowledge, like former Chief People Officers or Workforce Strategists, to engage with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.
*   **Compliance and Security:** For Enterprise clients (government, banks, professional services, retailers), having certifications like SOC 1, SOC 2, and ISO is crucial to avoid wasting sales cycle time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.
*   **"Land, Expand, Explode" Strategy:** Instead of attempting a full enterprise transformation upfront, solve a specific problem for a key area of the business to get "under the radar" and then expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. This approach helps reduce long sales cycles (from 12 months down to 5 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

## Hiring and Workforce Optimization

When building a workforce, the most effective approach is to:
1.  **Define Strategy:** Clarify the overall business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.
2.  **Break Down Work:** Deconstruct the strategy into specific tasks and chunks of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.
3.  **Allocate Tasks:** For each task, determine whether it should be done by:
    *   A human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>
    *   [[Artificial Intelligence and Workforce Transformation | AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>
    *   Offshored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>
    This granular approach often reveals that not all perceived hiring needs require a physical presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

Companies can build "[[Rise of AI agents and their impact on the workforce | AI agencies]]" internally, especially for areas like content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.

## Entrepreneurial Journey and Challenges

The founder's drive comes from a lifelong desire to build and create, evidenced by a baking business at age 13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, and a competitive upbringing as one of 12 children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Moving to New York was a strategic decision driven by the need to be close to Enterprise customers, as major companies have headquarters there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Building a large company from Australia, especially for Enterprise, is seen as challenging due to client expectations of physical presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

### Personal Reflections
Being a founder involves relentless effort and facing challenges daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. For a parent, work-life balance is often non-existent in a venture-backed startup, requiring an "all-consuming" focus on work and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>. Despite the sacrifices, the significant societal impact of ensuring access to meaningful work in an [[Artificial Intelligence and Workforce Transformation | AI-driven world]] makes the journey worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

### Distribution Strategy
Reig's distribution strategy relies heavily on:
*   **Educational Content:** Teaching and authentic, authoritative content creation for a new category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.
*   **Behind-the-Scenes Content:** Sharing insights into building the company and balancing personal life, leveraging the founder's story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.
*   **Community Building:** Giving away high-value, unique IP content for free to build a loyal community before monetizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.

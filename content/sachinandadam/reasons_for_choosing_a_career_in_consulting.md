From a young age, the hosts of the Sachin and Adam Show shared an ambition for a highly successful and impactful career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Upon completing their university degrees, they faced a [[career_decision_making | career decision]] on what path would best help them achieve their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

For business students, three [[pathways_into_management_consulting | conventional pathways]] are typically considered after university: consulting, law, and investment banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Both hosts ultimately chose the [[pathways_into_management_consulting | management consulting route]], believing it was the [[benefits_of_a_consulting_career | best decision possible]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Personal Journeys to Consulting

The hosts arrived at consulting through drastically [[pathways_into_management_consulting | different pathways]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>:

*   **Sachin's Path**
    *   Initially, Sachin was obsessed with startups and entrepreneurship during university, completing internships in venture capital and startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
    *   He held a negative view of corporates, expecting consulting to involve "suits and lots of boring people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
    *   He undertook a consulting internship in his third year, partly to appease his parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
    *   His first project involved helping create VR headsets for people in rural Australian communities to access internships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This experience completely reshaped his perception of corporate and consulting work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

*   **Adam's Path**
    *   Adam was initially interested in the public sector and working for the UN, driven by a passion for economics and helping the greater good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    *   He completed an internship at the New South Wales Treasury for four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   He quickly became disillusioned with the culture, work, and people there, leading to a personal crisis about his future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   To find his path, he connected with many people, learning about their careers, and undertook multiple internships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   He worked in investment banking, corporate finance, various startups, and several consultancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
    *   Through these experiences, he discovered that consulting offered "awesome people," "really fascinating projects," and a strong alignment with his skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This led to a strong conviction that consulting was the right path after university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Key Reasons for Choosing Consulting

The hosts identified four major reasons for starting their careers in management consulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>:

### Diverse Industry Exposure
Consulting provides exposure to a wide range of industries, suitable for naturally curious individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Projects can span energy, financial services, government, education, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Solving Varied Problems
Consultants solve a diverse set of problems for large businesses and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This could range from creating a new fintech app for a bank to working on a multi-billion dollar transaction, including due diligence and market analysis for a private equity client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### High-Caliber Colleagues and Access to Leaders
Consulting attracts highly intelligent and ambitious people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The caliber of colleagues is seen as an indication of future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Additionally, even junior consultants can be in the room with high-power executives, an opportunity not commonly found in other roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Abundant Exit Opportunities
Consulting is often used as a [[consulting_as_a_springboard_for_future_opportunities | springboard for a future and bigger career]], with consultants typically spending two to three years in the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The diverse and challenging nature of the work provides consultants with numerous options for their later careers, including:
*   Big tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   Startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>
*   Investing (private equity or venture capital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
*   Industry roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>

## Considerations and Challenges

Despite the benefits, the hosts also acknowledge the [[challenges_of_working_in_consulting | flip side of the job]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>:

*   **General Skill Set:** While exploring many industries is fascinating for young professionals, the frequent project rotation (every one to three months) can limit the development of deep competencies in specific areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Work-Life Balance:** While some firms may offer a good work-life balance, many consultancies require significant hours, often 60-70 or even 80 hours per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Extended periods of travel for projects can also be tiring, making it difficult to maintain relationships with family and friends or pursue hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Consulting is definitely not a nine-to-five job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

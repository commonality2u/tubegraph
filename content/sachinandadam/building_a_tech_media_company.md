Kindling is a new venture launched by co-founders Sain and Adam, who quit their jobs to go "all in" on [[building_a_media_brand | building their dream company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. They describe their endeavor as a "building public" series, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the highs and lows of their journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Their aim is to provide a raw and real account of what it's like to build a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Origins of Kindling

Sain, previously in venture capital, and Adam, in management consulting, decided to dedicate themselves fully to Kindling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The company is structured as a tech media company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

The co-founders met on an exchange program in Utrecht, Netherlands, and quickly became close friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. After returning to Sydney, they started a podcast out of boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Initially, their content was broad, reflecting their wide interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This served as a vehicle for them to discover the world and be curious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

As their interests shifted towards technology, their content followed suit, leading them to interview entrepreneurs and venture capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. A significant moment was securing an interview with former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which garnered millions of views on TikTok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This was their "big break" and the first time they considered the podcast as a potential career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

The podcast became a niche focused on technology and venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, partly inspired by Adam Ilgam, an investor in socially impactful startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. They sought a for-profit route to social impact, leading them down a rabbit hole of curiosity into the tech and impact investing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### The Decision to Go "All In"

Despite their growing interest in tech and venture capital, the idea of pursuing the podcast full-time wasn't initially taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. They considered it more as a "gap year" or "personal MBA" for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. However, an "existential moment" during a walk to work led Adam to a moment of clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. He realized they didn't just have to start a podcast, but could create something worth over $100 million and impact millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. This sparked the idea of [[building_a_media_brand | building a big Media company]] for tech in Australia and Asia Pacific, recruiting others, and starting new shows beyond their existing podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

This vision was born from a desire to turn their efforts into a very serious [[building_a_successful_tech_startup | startup endeavor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. They identified that this was likely their last chance to go all-in on such a venture, living together and with parents to fund it, before commitments like marriage and children made it harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

Initially, Sain was hesitant, feeling he hadn't achieved enough in his career and being aware of the difficulties of startup life from observing many founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. He also felt constrained by the "venture mindset" of needing to [[building_a_billion_dollar_company | build a billion dollar company]] for a large fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. However, they realized they could create value for millions of people and then monetize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. They overcame the artificial constraint of [[bootstrapping_a_tech_company | bootstrapping]] and gave themselves permission to think big <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. Once the idea was fleshed out, it felt "really, really right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

## Vision for Kindling

Kindling has two main parts to its vision:

1.  **APAC's Tech Media Company:** The goal is to build the best tech media in the world for the APAC and India region, under the Kindling umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. This includes podcasts, newsletters, TikToks, and any other content consumption platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. They believe media is having an increasing moment, with it being easier than ever to reach people using AI and editing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. There are still many niches and stories to be discovered in Asia Pacific tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

2.  **Data and Insights Platform:** Beyond eyeballs, media provides information, data, and insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. They are passionate about areas like EdTech and customer intelligence platforms, where media can serve as a wedge to gain distribution and gather necessary data for building education and data products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. This follows a "distribution-first" model, similar to how creators like Logan Paul (Prime) and Mr. Beast (chocolate brand) leverage their audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

The co-founders believe in the growing [[the_role_of_media_in_tech_entrepreneurship | parasocial relationship with creators]] over traditional media platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. They recognize the trend of the creator economy and independent media platforms, and foresee more change as AI tools accelerate software development, making distribution and creator relationships even more vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

## Challenges and "Building Public"

The journey is not without its challenges. The co-founders have drastically cut their pay and moved back home with their parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. They have made personal sacrifices, such as cutting out alcohol and focusing intently on work and running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. They are also aware of the responsibilities that come with taking on funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.

Their "building public" series aims to share the "real vulnerable story" of [[leadership_lessons_and_company_building_in_the_tech_industry | building a company]], including personal aspects of their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>. This is intended to be a long-term commitment, a "life's work situation," with continuous iteration, learning, and sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. They emphasize that while they started with curiosity and a lack of transactional intent, they become highly structured and intentional when pursuing their vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

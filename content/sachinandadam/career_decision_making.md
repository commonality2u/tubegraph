Adam Powick, CEO of Deloitte Australia, shares his unique perspective on [[entrepreneurship_and_decisionmaking | career decisions]], emphasizing an organic approach over rigid planning. His journey from a "knock about lad" in Melbourne's northern suburbs to a global leader illustrates the power of curiosity, adaptability, and strong relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## An Unplanned Path
Powick candidly admits he's "the most surprised of anybody" about his current role, having never had a fixed career plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. After school, he had "no idea what I want to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. His initial choice, aeronautical engineering at a "third-tier" university, was driven by interest rather than a clear career goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. He later realized there were "no jobs" in that field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Core Principles for Career Progression
Instead of detailed plans, Powick's career was guided by a few fundamental principles:
*   **Continuous Learning and Growth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>: He always sought to learn new things. If something became boring, he stopped; if it was interesting and challenging, he continued learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Seizing Opportunities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>: He consistently took every available opportunity, even if it pushed him out of his [[life_and_career_adaptability | comfort zone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. An example is moving to the US for two years with a 13-month-old child, which was a "big risk" but completely changed his perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Building Networks and Relationships** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>: Powick considers the strength of one's network the "critical thing" for success in life and career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. He cultivated relationships naturally, treating everyone from the car park operator to the CEO with equal importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
*   **The "Give to Get" Mentality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>: He believes in contributing to relationships without immediate expectation of return, as the universe eventually supports those who give <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. Genuine interest in the person, not just their role, is key to authentic connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.

## Advice for Young People and Career Choices
Adam Powick offers several pieces of [[advice_for_young_people_and_career_choices | advice for young people]] navigating their careers:

> "My counsel would be don't limit yourself because a plan limits you. Give yourself an opportunity for two or three years to grow, to learn." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>

*   **Embrace Opportunities:** Take every opportunity, even seemingly "boring" roles, and ask questions to learn from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Learning:** Learn from every task, especially tough projects and failures, as these are critical learning moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. He believes people who succeed the most have failed the most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Invest in Networks:** Cultivate a strong network, treating everyone as important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. Maintain contact, as today's peers may become tomorrow's "titans of industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.
*   **Be Adaptable:** [[life_and_career_adaptability | Adaptability]] is the number one characteristic of long-term success, especially given unexpected events like a global pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. Rigid planning can limit opportunities that arise unexpectedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.

## Self-Awareness and Authenticity
Powick highlights the importance of [[overcoming_overthinking_and_decisionmaking | self-awareness]] in career progression. He reflects on being perceived as a "larrikin" or "joker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>, which cost him promotions early in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

> "The question I would leave... is one question that is so critical in a career: How am I perceived?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>

He advises asking this question to trusted individuals, both close and slightly removed, to gain diverse perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. Authenticity is crucial, but it must be coupled with self-development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. The ultimate goal is to "be yourself," but to be smart about it by elevating strengths and managing weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

His experience in Asia Pacific roles forced him to moderate his blunt Australian style, learning to communicate differently and be more attentive to cultural differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.

## Mentorship and Role Models
[[impact_of_early_life_challenges_on_career_drive | Mentors]] played a critical role in Adam's career, with early mentors seeing potential in his "rough diamond" persona and guiding him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. He emphasizes having multiple mentors from different parts of life to provide diverse feedback and test ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

A significant turning point in his career came with the realization of becoming a role model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. This brought a "sense of responsibility" and the understanding that his actions were being watched and emulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. Similarly, becoming a father also instantly brought maturity and a sense of responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

## Management vs. Leadership
Powick distinguishes between management and leadership:
*   **Management** involves competently executing tasks, managing activities, or leading teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Leadership** goes beyond management; it involves improving processes, thinking ahead, developing people, innovating, and taking courage to drive change and outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Leaders inspire and bring people along on a journey, fostering continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

## Multiple Careers Within One Organization
Despite spending nearly his entire career at Deloitte, Adam views it as having had "15 different careers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. He has held numerous global and regional roles, avoiding stagnation by constantly seeking new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.

He challenges the modern trend of frequently changing organizations, arguing that moving jobs can set one back in rebuilding networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>. Instead, he advocates for changing *what you do* every few years, which can be achieved within a large organization like Deloitte, offering diverse experiences, for example, in [[reasons_for_choosing_a_career_in_consulting | consulting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>.

## Defining a Good Life
For Adam Powick, a "good life" and his ultimate legacy centers around developing people. He finds the most pride in watching those he has mentored grow into leaders in their own right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. Maintaining a close-knit family and a vibrant network of friends are also crucial components of a fulfilling life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. This focus on nurturing others highlights his dedication to [[balancing_family_and_career_success | balancing career goals with personal life and family]] impact.

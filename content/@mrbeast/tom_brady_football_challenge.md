### The Challenge Setup

The challenge consisted of a friendly yet fierce contest where both competitors were tasked with throwing a football to pop balloons. Each participant had four balloons to pop, with the first to do so [[challenge_with_a_monetary_reward | winning a staggering prize of $100,000]]. To even the playing field, Brady's balloons were intentionally made smaller, acknowledging his seven Super Bowl rings and legendary status as a quarterback. This handicap was designed to make the competition more balanced and entertaining for the audience [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">00:00:28</a>].

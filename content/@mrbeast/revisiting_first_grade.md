Revisiting the foundational years of our educational journey can be both humbling and surprising. In the fun-filled video featuring MrBeast and his friends, the crew embarks on a whimsical journey back to first grade. This reunion with the basics encompasses challenges that are both educational and entertaining, showcasing how much—or little—we remember from our earliest school days.

## The Beginning of the Journey 

The video begins with MrBeast and his friends returning to first grade, with the objective of advancing through each grade to ultimately win a grand prize of $10,000. The rules are simple: miss more than two questions on any test and you're eliminated from progressing to the next grade. The motivation? Avoiding punishment with water balloons and, of course, the cash prize at the end for the last person standing. 

## Meet the Participants

As the teacher, Miss Whitford, introduces the class, each participant shares an interesting fact about themselves:
- **MrBeast**: Famously known for his dislike of school.
- **Chandler**: Has a fondness for Gushers.
- **Garrot**: Proudly states that his dad owns a yacht. [[comparison_of_yachts_by_price | comparison of yachts by price]]
- **Ethan**: Enjoys playing Fortnite.
- **Bailey**: Started the day with oatmeal for breakfast.

This introduction sets a light-hearted tone for what’s to come.

## Activities in First Grade

The crew is immediately thrust into familiar elementary school exercises. The session starts with a reading exercise where they must pay close attention to a story being read aloud. This is followed by a crucial first-grade math test, emphasizing basic arithmetic skills. Phones and calculators are strictly off-limits as participants are tested on their ability to perform straightforward calculations mentally and on paper.

## The Test and Results

The test consists of 10 questions, aligning with familiar academic disciplines of math and reading. After everyone completes the test, there is palpable tension as answers are exchanged and graded by peers. The results for this first grade test are promising—no one misses more than two questions. It's a collective success, and everyone advances to the second grade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## An Educational Flashback

Revisiting first grade serves as a reminder of the building blocks of education—listening skills, basic arithmetic, and the simplicity of early academic life. These early lessons form the basis for future learning, as seen in the way each participant reflects on their performance.

This delightful revisit to first grade not only entertains but also reaffirms the fundamental skills that remain relevant throughout our lives. As MrBeast and friends demonstrate, sometimes the basics are just as challenging as the complexities we face later in academia. The nostalgic journey through first grade is a playful yet enlightening experience that highlights the importance of foundational education in a creative and amusing manner.

## The Decoy Vault

The event kicked off with a decoy vault [00:00:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">00:00:08</a>). Contestants rushed to touch the vault with the hope of winning immediately, only to discover it was a mere diversion.

## Maneuvering Through Obstacles

The contestants had to navigate a field of low-hanging obstacles [00:00:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">00:00:49</a>). This stage required physical agility and careful timing to avoid setting off alarms, highlighting the importance of precision and finesse [00:00:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">00:00:53</a>).

## The City of Red Solo Cups

One of the more visually captivating challenges involved a room filled with supposedly over a billion red solo cups [00:01:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">00:01:12</a>). Contestants had to sift through the cups to find a key, displaying patience and attention to detail in their search [00:01:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">00:01:20</a>).

## Blindfolded Garage Door

A blend of suspense and speed was added when the contestants were blindfolded with the garage door descending [00:02:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">00:02:00</a>). Quick reactions were critical to both avoid the door and to emerge as the quickest contestant [00:02:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">00:02:03</a>). [[decision_making_under_pressure]]

## Legos and Key Retrieval

A tricky trial was the Lego structure challenge, where contestants had to use blocks to build their way to a key hanging above [00:02:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">00:02:24</a>). This task tested creative engineering solutions and teamwork [00:02:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">00:02:30</a>). [[creative_solutions_and_resilience_in_building_projects]]

## Navigating the Laser Grid

Skill and timing were again crucial in traversing a room filled with disappearing and reappearing lasers [00:03:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">00:03:29</a>). Each competitor had to pass through the grid without touching the lasers, requiring stealthy movements and concentration [00:04:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">00:04:06</a>).

## Electric Wire Trickery

Another psychological challenge included navigating between 'electric' wires. Although harmless, they were designed to instill fear and hesitation [00:04:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53">00:04:53</a>), with one contestant boldly making a run through them, unaware of the wires' true nature [00:05:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">00:05:10</a>).

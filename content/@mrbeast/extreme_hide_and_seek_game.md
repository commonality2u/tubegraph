The hospital's vast hallways, multiple buildings, and hidden areas offered both advantage and challenge to the contestants trying to avoid capture, similar to a [[survival_challenge_in_an_abandoned_city | survival tactic in an urban exploration]].

## The Hunt Begins

MrBeast initiated the hunt, aiming to quickly tag participants and send them to "jail," an area designated for caught contestants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The first catch was Sam, who unfortunately tripped, allowing MrBeast to tag him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## The Chase Intensifies

Throughout the challenge, MrBeast was assisted by Chris, who helped in tracking down participants spread across the abandoned site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. A notable capture was Mitch, who was caught after a brief chase, showcasing [[strategies_for_evading_capture_through_disguises_and_decoys | strategic evasion techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

Unexpected complications added drama, such as when Chris hurt his knee during the chase, making it more difficult for him to apprehend contestants, demonstrating the [[psychological_and_physical_challenges_of_endurance_competitions | physical challenges inherent in such events]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Mid-Game Twists

Participants like Nolan cleverly evaded capture by using high ground and strategic movements, a tactic often seen in [[military_strategy_and_tactics | competitive strategy scenarios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The group resorted to diverse tactics, such as hiding under trailers and blending with their surroundings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

A significant twist was Sapnap’s attempt to negotiate with MrBeast to reveal the location of other participants, which led to a temporary distraction in the hunt, echoing themes of [[decision_making_and_honesty_in_high_stakes_situations | honesty in high-pressure scenarios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## The Final Moments

The hiding area ultimately shrunk to just the hospital premises, increasing tensions as the field narrowed, much like a [[final_vote_and_tiebreaker_decision | final showdown in strategic games]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

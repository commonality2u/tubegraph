In a captivating social experiment, two strangers, Suzie and Bailey, were tasked with [[surviving_in_isolation_for_cash | surviving 100 days]] in a confined white cube for the chance to win a $500,000 prize. This intriguing setup introduced numerous incentives and temptations designed to [[psychology_and_group_dynamics_in_competitions | test their resolve and decision-making skills]].

## Initial Setup and Introduction

Upon entering the isolation chamber, both participants were provided with sufficient resources to survive the full 100 days, including a private bathroom, a shower, and basic meals consisting of the same food repeatedly. What seemed most daunting, however, was the loss of time perception, as they were [[psychological_effects_of_isolation_and_confinement | isolated from any indication of the outside world and its passage of time]]. This psychological component added an additional layer of challenge to their stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The First Temptation: Gourmet Food

On day 10, the first significant temptation was introduced: a private chef who would cook [[expensive_gourmet_foods | gourmet meals]] for the remainder of the challenge, priced at $50,000. The chef's offer to prepare a delicious meal was an enticing break from their monotonous diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Initially swayed by the prospect of diversified meals, Suzie and Bailey ultimately resolved to decline the offer, [[decision_making_and_the_impact_of_monetary_incentives | choosing to preserve their prize money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Lights Out and Comfy Beds

By day 20, [[psychological_effects_of_isolation | sleep deprivation]] led to significant discomfort. They were offered smart beds and the ability to control the lights in exchange for another $50,000 of their prize money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Despite their prior experience with bright lights and the allure of peaceful, uninterrupted sleep, they shockingly refused the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Small Luxuries Add Up

On day 30, they faced a myriad of smaller temptations, each costing $10,000, ranging from a coffee machine to the entire [[using_creative_methods_to_complete_a_task | Harry Potter book collection]], spices, a Monopoly game, and phone calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Suzie and Bailey discerned which items were essential for their morale; they invested in coffee and the book series—concessions for daily comfort and [[emotional_and_family_dynamics_during_long_challenges | mental engagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Family Connections and Emotional Choices

A deeply emotional temptation greeted them on day 50: $20,000 for a visit from their family. During Suzie's mother's birthday, [[emotional_impacts_of_prolonged_separation | weighing family connections]] against monetary gain posed an agonizing decision—they eventually chose to spend the money for a cherished familial encounter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## The Concealed Treasures: A Surprising Turn

The ultimate test arrived on day 60 with a [[concept_and_appeal_of_mystery_boxes | mysterious box]] priced at $50,000, concealing contents more valuable than they predicted. Despite hopeful speculation—such as speculating it might hide car keys for a Tesla—they declined, later discovering it contained precisely what they yearned for: two Teslas and the exact sum of money spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. This choice haunted them, a regret-provoking catalyst shaping their subsequent decisions.

## Reflection and Final Decisions

As the challenge approached its conclusion, they were confronted with an enticing ultimatum: accept all previous temptations, including luxurious accommodations, food, and entertainment, for a bid beyond a hidden minimum price. Successfully, they secured their comforts at a cost of $100,101, overpaying but finally yielding to temptation to enhance their environment significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Split or Steal Dilemma

The final twist was the [[decision_making_and_the_impact_of_monetary_incentives | split or steal dilemma]]: a decision on whether to share the prize money or attempt to take it all. Despite earlier mistrust and regrets, they chose to split, ending their trial in harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>.

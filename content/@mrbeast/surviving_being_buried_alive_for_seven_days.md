Buried under 20,000 pounds of dirt, MrBeast undertook a remarkable and daunting challenge: surviving seven days in a coffin underground [[experience_of_being_buried_alive | Experience of being buried alive]]. This feat of endurance, while seemingly inconceivable, was brought to life amidst numerous challenges and careful preparations [[challenges_faced_during_the_burial | Challenges faced during the burial]].

## The Setup

MrBeast began his adventure by being buried alive under an incredible amount of dirtâ€”a terrifying experience by his own admission. Positioned inside a specially prepared coffin, he relied heavily on its construction to ensure his survival for the entire week [[safety_measures_taken_for_the_burial_challenge | Safety measures taken for the burial challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Essential Supplies

To endure the week, MrBeast was provided with a briefcase of essentials and a 5-gallon drum of water. His sustenance was primarily MREs (Meals Ready to Eat) and snacks, stored in the briefcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Despite this, he joked about potentially running out of food before the end of the challenge [[adapting_living_conditions_for_a_prolonged_stay | Adapting living conditions for a prolonged stay]].

## Health and Safety Measures

Throughout the ordeal, safety was a major concern. Constant monitoring was necessary to ensure MrBeast's oxygen supply remained adequate and to guard against the possibility of blood clots, which can occur due to prolonged periods of inactivity [[dangers_and_risks_of_extreme_challenges | Dangers and risks of extreme challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Psychological Effects

Beyond physical discomfort, MrBeast faced significant psychological challenges [[psychological_effects_of_isolation | Psychological effects of isolation]]. Isolation and monotony led to periods of distress. He recounted moments where he struggled with motivation and emotional wellbeing, noting the peculiar sensation of crying without a clear cause [[emotional_impact_of_competitions_on_participants | Emotional impact of competitions on participants]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Attempts at Entertainment

To counteract the enforced boredom [[isolation_experiment_dynamics | Isolation experiment dynamics]], various attempts at entertainment were made. The team utilized speakers for creative disruptions, and his friends even dug a tunnel to reach him, providing MrBeast with brief moments of camaraderie [[friends_interactions_and_support_during_the_challenge | Friends interactions and support during the challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

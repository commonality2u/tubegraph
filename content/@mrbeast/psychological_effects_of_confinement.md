Confinement is a state of being restricted within a limited space, cut off from the outside world. This experience can have profound psychological effects on individuals, and it was thoroughly demonstrated by Mr. Beast in his unique and daunting challenge of [[surviving_being_buried_alive_for_seven_days | living buried alive for seven days]] under 20,000 pounds of dirt. Below, we delve into the psychological impacts and survival strategies of such a confined experience as seen in the video.

## Initial Reactions

### Anxiety and Fear

The immediate psychological impact of confinement is typically anxiety, especially when the situation involves potential danger. Mr. Beast expressed this emotion multiple times as the dirt began to cover his coffin, revealing a genuine fear of the situation. In the beginning moments, he stated, "This is going to be terrifying. This is pretty much most people's worst fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Coping Mechanisms

### Sleep as an Escape

One of the suggested coping mechanisms for dealing with confinement is sleep. Sleeping minimizes consciousness of distress, providing a mental escape from the reality of the situation. Mr. Beast outlined his plan: "The goal is to sleep as much through this challenge as possible for my own sanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This strategy appeared pivotal in maintaining his mental balance during the challenge.

### Humor and Entertainment

In high-stress situations, individuals might resort to [[humor_and_unexpected_moments_during_the_challenge | humor and creativity]] as a means of coping. Mr. Beast attempted to lighten his situation by joking with his friends and engaging in entertaining activities. For instance, he humorously noted his boredom-induced actions: "I was so bored, I actually ended up punching my coffin for fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Psychological Stressors

### Sensory Deprivation

Extended confinement often leads to sensory deprivation, which can result in heightened anxiety or hallucinations. Mr. Beast expressed this through moments of disorientation and a diminished motivation to engage in basic activities, a feeling compounded by the monotonous environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### Loneliness and Isolation

The challenge included a strong sense of loneliness despite being in contact with his team via radio. Mr. Beast noted after a milestone celebration: "I just want to get out of here... I'm doing my best to talk to you guys for content, but to be honest, I have, like, zero desire to speak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## Emotional Fluctuations

The mental strain of being confined can lead to significant emotional fluctuations.

I'm doing this thing where I'm crying and I'm not 100% sure why I'm crying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The isolation and stress of confinement often result in such unpredictable emotional states.

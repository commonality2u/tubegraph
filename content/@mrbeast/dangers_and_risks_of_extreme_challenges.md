Extreme challenges have gained popularity thanks to social media platforms and YouTube creators who push the boundaries of endurance and mental fortitude. While these challenges can be entertaining, they come with inherent dangers and risks that need to be addressed. In a recent video, YouTuber MrBeast embarks on a particularly daunting challenge: spending [[experience_of_being_buried_alive | seven days buried alive]]. This article explores the various dangers and risks associated with extreme challenges, with insights drawn from MrBeast's experience.

## The Physical and Psychological Toll

One of the foremost concerns in extreme challenges is the physical and psychological toll they take on individuals. In the challenge of being buried alive, several risks were highlighted:

- **Immobility Risk**: Remaining immobile for an extended period can lead to dangerous health complications, such as blood clots. MrBeast noted, "Apparently laying down for seven days straight can kill you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. It's essential to move periodically to prevent such occurrences.

- **Loss of Sanity**: The mental strain of these challenges can be overwhelming. MrBeast described the experience as mental agony, stating, "I'm in mental agony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The isolation and monotony can lead to feelings of depression and distress.

- **Bodily Functions and Hygiene**: Handling basic bodily functions becomes complicated, as MrBeast highlighted the discomfort of dealing with waste disposal in such confined spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Environmental Hazards

The environment in which these challenges take place can also introduce significant risks:

- **Weight Pressure**: The 20,000 pounds of dirt above presented a constant existential threat. MrBeast mentioned the fear of the structure failing repeatedly, showcasing the precariousness of his setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

- **Weather Conditions**: Unpredictable weather, such as rain, which can increase the weight and pressure of the surrounding dirt, causing potential collapse risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Safety and Monitoring

Safety measures and constant monitoring are crucial in these situations:

- **Round-the-clock Surveillance**: Ensuring someone is always available to respond in emergencies is a necessity. MrBeast's team maintained a 24/7 monitoring system via walkie-talkies to ensure his safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

- **Professional Oversight**: In situations involving elevated risk, professional oversight and medical evaluations are important. MrBeast consulted his doctor about necessary movements to prevent health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

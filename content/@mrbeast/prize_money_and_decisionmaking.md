In a gripping social experiment captured on video, 100 contestants ranging from ages 1 to 100 competed for a grand prize of $250,000. [[ages_1_to_100_competition | The competitionâ€™s unique format]] not only pushed physical and social boundaries but also tested the contestants' decision-making and moral principles. [[psychology_and_group_dynamics_in_competitions | This dynamics-driven challenge]] provided insights into human behavior when significant prize money is at stake. Let's delve into the critical moments of decision-making and their implications for victory.

## The Structure of the Challenge

The competition involved participants confined to individual cubes, with strict rules disallowing stepping out or touching the red line outside their cubes. This isolation was crucial for the psychological aspects of decision-making as contestants navigated both personal desires and group strategies.

## Importance of Alliances and Friendships

From the beginning, it became evident that forming friendships and alliances would be strategic for survival. Unlike typical last-to-leave challenges, this contest prioritized social connections, as the contestants themselves determined the winner.

## The Role of Pressure in Decision-Making

As the competition intensified, participants faced the pressure of eliminating their fellow contestants either through collective agreement or through the elimination challenges devised by MrBeast. During each round, contestants had to make tough choices, often under time constraints, which significantly impacted their decision-making processes. [[decision_making_under_pressure | Decision making under pressure]] was a key factor in the outcomes.

### Mid-Contest Pressure and Elimination

In one segment, if 10 participants did not volunteer to leave their cubes, a random 25 would be eliminated, adding psychological stress and amplifying the difficulty of the choices being made. [[elimination_drama_in_competitive_events | Elimination tactics]] tested each participant's resolve.

## High-Stakes Offers

The host offered escalating monetary incentives to captains to eliminate their entire rows, forcing individuals to weigh individual greed against the collective good. [[incentives_and_temptation | This moment encapsulated]] the tension between personal gain and ethical decision-making.

## The Concluding Phase: Ranking and Final Decisions

As the contest progressed, contestants were asked to rank who should win, introducing a democratic process to winner determination and reinforcing the importance of collective decision-making.

### Decision by Consensus

In a culminating challenge, participants were prompted to unanimously agree on a winner. However, with time pressing, a ranking system was introduced, leading ultimately to the crowning of the most deserving contestant, according to peers.

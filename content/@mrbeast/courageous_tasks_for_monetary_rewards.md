## Bathtub of Snakes Challenge

One of the standout challenges involved participants sitting in a bathtub filled with snakes, incentivized by a $10,000 reward for their mothers. The task, clear and straightforward yet petrifying for many, required overcoming [[overcoming_fears | instinctual fears]] for the sake of financial reward. When faced with the opportunity, one participant, Chandler, quickly opted out, illustrating the intense fear that snakes can instill in people. However, this challenge provided a thrilling spectacle and served as a testament to human reactions in high-stress situations involving reptiles [[challenges_involving_snakes_and_money | [00:00:00]]].

## Cockroach Container Money Grab

Another challenge in the video had participants attempt to grab as much money as possible from a box covered with giant cockroaches. The sound technician, Jeff, took on this challenge and managed to secure $9,340, showcasing a noteworthy blend of fear and determination as he navigated the obstacle of crawling insects to gain a financial reward [[decision_making_and_honesty_in_high_stakes_situations | [00:00:40]]].

## Tarantula Timer Challenge

Tareq, another participant, faced his fears by allowing a tarantula to crawl on him for thirty seconds to earn $10,000 for his mother. This task notably involved his mother’s presence for support and the inducement of doubling the money if bitten, though the latter was said in jest. This challenge underscored the power of [[emotional_and_family_dynamics_during_long_challenges | familial bonds as motivators]] in overcoming personal fears [[emotional_impact_of_competitions_on_participants | [00:02:01]]].

## Bath of Pickles for Pickle Phobia

In a peculiar twist, Chandler, who was terrified of pickles, was presented with a tub full of them. He had previously refused to eat a pickle for $5,000 due to his phobia, so the offer was substantial: if he sat in the tub, his sister would receive $20,000. Chandler eventually participated, driven by the familial financial benefit, further highlighting how individuals can navigate through their fears for [[dedication_to_winning_for_a_family_member | the betterment of family]] [[psychology_and_group_dynamics_in_competitions | [00:04:18]]].

Let's delve into how this celebration unfolded.

## The Extreme Start to a Celebration

The celebration for reaching 200 million subscribers began with a highly ambitious challenge. MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, committed to spending seven days buried alive. This was described as both the scariest and most unusual endeavor of his YouTube career. Throughout the week, Jimmy had to rely on a custom coffin outfitted with necessities for survival, including MREs (meal ready to eat), a five-gallon drum of water, and essential survival gear packed by his friends [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">00:00:57</a>].

## Surviving the Days Underground

Throughout his time underground, Jimmy faced numerous challenges, including discomfort, back pain, and a lack of mental stimulation. His strategy to cope with the isolation was to sleep as much as possible to pass the time [[psychological_effects_of_confinement | due to the psychological effects of confinement]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">00:02:01</a>]. However, his friends, who were entrusted with his safety and entertainment, ensured that his experience was anything but restful, with pranks and loud noises keeping him on edge [[creative_ways_to_annoy_friends | as creative ways to annoy friends]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">00:06:05</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">00:06:53</a>].

## The Climax of Reaching 200 Million

From his underground hideaway, Jimmy witnessed the subscriber count inch closer to the 200 million mark, thanks to Verizon 5G home internet that worked even ten feet underground [[use_of_technology_and_creativity_in_elaborate_hide_and_seek | showcasing the use of technology in extreme challenges]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">00:11:02</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">00:11:17</a>].

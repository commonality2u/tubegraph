Orbeez, the popular water-absorbing beads, are commonly used in various creative projects and activities due to their unique ability to expand significantly when hydrated. However, like many items not naturally found in the environment, their use raises questions regarding environmental impact and sustainability. This article discusses the [[environmental_considerations | environmental considerations]] associated with using Orbeez.

## Expansion and Environmental Impact

One of the primary environmental concerns regarding Orbeez is their incredible expansion capability. Orbeez can grow up to 30 times their original size when introduced to water. This property, while fascinating, raises potential issues when it comes to disposal and environmental impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. If not disposed of properly, they could contribute to landscape and waterway clutter, much like any non-biodegradable materials.

## Disposal of Orbeez

Given their resilient nature, appropriate disposal of Orbeez is critical. The host of the video emphasized the importance of cleaning up the Orbeez properly after use. Despite the massive quantity of Orbeez used in the demonstration—100 million to be precise—there was a strong pledge made to ensure that all Orbeez would be collected and not left to impact the environment negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## Biodegradability of Orbeez

A reassuring factor discussed within the video is the biodegradability of Orbeez. They are designed to break down over time, mitigating long-term environmental concerns if for some reason small quantities are overlooked during cleanup. The video's speaker affirmed that Orbeez left behind (due to an inflow of rainwater or other uncontrollable factors) are not harmful to animals like squirrels, which may interact with them in a typical environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

## Conclusion

While Orbeez are designed to be safe and biodegradable, the necessity for careful and conscientious disposal is paramount. Their intriguing features when hydrated make them a popular choice for activities and demonstrations but also pose potential risks if not managed correctly. It is crucial for users to commit to responsible usage and ensure that these fascinating water beads do not harm our environment.

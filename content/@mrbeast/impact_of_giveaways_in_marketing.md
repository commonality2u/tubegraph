## The Strategy of Giving Away

Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, is a content creator famed for his large-scale stunts and philanthropy, often manifesting in the form of extravagant giveaways. In his venture of [[opening_a_free_restaurant | opening the world’s first free restaurant]], MrBeast took the extraordinary step of also paying people to eat at his establishment. This approach attracted significant attention, leading to a mile-long line of traffic and over a thousand cars waiting for a taste of the free burgers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### The Mechanics of the Giveaway 

The core of MrBeast’s strategy was to create an experience that combined free products with monetary gifts. Customers received free Beast Burgers and, in some instances, additional items such as cash, AirPods, or iPads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. For instance, one bag contained a burger and fries while another contained AirPods and a lump sum of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### The Impact on Consumer Behavior

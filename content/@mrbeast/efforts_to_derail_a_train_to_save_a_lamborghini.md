In a dramatic and high-stakes challenge, Blake, a returning contestant on a viral video series, attempted to use unconventional methods to derail a train and protect a Lamborghini from destruction. The challenge was a part of a multi-phase competition where Blake was tasked to defend a Lamborghini through various intense scenarios. This unique competition blended aspects of [[creative_survival_challenges | creative survival challenges]] and offered insights into [[high_stakes_competitions | high stakes competitions]].

## Building the Derailment Structure

Blake's strategy to stop the train involved creating a barricade with materials repurposed from previous phases of the challenge. He aimed to derail the train by leveraging a combination of heavy and resilient materials, including shipping containers and items used in earlier phases of the competition.

> - **Railroad Ties**: Blake believed that railroad ties, which previously contributed to a challenge loss, could be placed strategically to help derail the train. His plan was to stack and place these ties under the tracks to lift the train off its course just enough to derail it, aiming for at least a two-inch deviation to succeed (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01">[16:01]</a>).

> - **Concrete and Containers**: He intended to cover the ties with concrete and protect the car with a fortress of shipping containers filled with various cushioning materials to absorb any residual impact energy (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24">[09:24]</a>).

## Execution and Challenges

### Implementation

The challenge was incredibly taxing, requiring Blake and his team to work through the night. As the clock ticked down, they meticulously placed components like shipping containers and additional obstacles on the track. By carefully stacking materials, they aimed to create a formidable enough obstruction that could withstand the train's impact (<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47">[16:47]</a>).

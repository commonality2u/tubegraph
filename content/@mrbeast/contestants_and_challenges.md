[[building_willy_wonkas_chocolate_factory | The factory adventure]] combined nostalgia with modern entertainment through a series of engaging challenges, each designed to whittle down the contestants until one emerged victorious.

## The Contestants

Ten lucky contestants were selected to participate after finding a golden ticket in one of MrBeast's Feastable Bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. These individuals each harbored dreams of owning the coveted chocolate factory, a prize that would demand not only luck but also strategic prowess and a hearty appetite for competition.

## Challenging Rounds

### 1. **Hide and Seek in a Candy Wonderland**

The first challenge was a classic [[hide_and_seek_game | game of hide and seek]], set within the confines of the whimsical chocolate factory. Contestants had 1,000 seconds to hide, while MrBeast and his team attempted to locate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This round tested their creativity and agility as they navigated through candy-themed rooms, including a marshmallow-filled area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### 2. **The Candy Wall of Death**

Following the hide and seek, contestants faced the formidable [[candy_wall_of_death | Candy Wall of Death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Here, they needed to ascend a candy-themed rock wall. The key was speed and dexterity, as the last person to reach the top would be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### 3. **Chocolate Bar Speed-Eating**

The third challenge unleashed the competitive spirit in a [[competitive_eating | speed-eating contest]] featuring MrBeast's Feastable Bars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Contestants raced against time and each other to finish the chocolate, with the slowest teams facing elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### 4. **Mentos and Coke Experiment**

In a nod to viral science experiments, contestants aimed the world's largest Mentos into the world's largest bottle of Coke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The challenge required precision and luck, with successful attempts leading to strategic eliminations among peers [[challenge_formats_and_rules_in_competitions | during the round]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### 5. **Marshmallow Carousel Spin-Off**

As the competition intensified, contestants balanced on a spinning peppermint carousel within a room filled with marshmallows.

This deceptively simple task was fraught with tension, as the incorrect choice meant elimination.

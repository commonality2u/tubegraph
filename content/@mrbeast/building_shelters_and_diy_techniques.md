In the recent event where two strangers, Hase and Grizz, were pitted against the elements in a wilderness challenge, survival skills were put to the test. With the goal of earning $10,000 for every day they survived in the wild, the focus was on utilizing natural resources to build shelters and employing do-it-yourself techniques to enhance their living conditions. This article delves into their strategies for [[surviving_in_the_wilderness_for_money | building shelters and the DIY methods]] that contributed significantly to their survival.

## Establishing a Camping Spot

Upon starting their adventure, the primary concern for Hase and Grizz was finding a suitable camping spot and building a stable shelter. Initially, they decided to construct a temporary campsite by using the surrounding natural resources. They quickly gathered wood, utilizing a [[adapting_and_finding_resources_in_nature | fire starter]] to keep warm during the frigid nights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Constructing the First Shelter

The initial nights in the wilderness were challenging due to harsh weather conditions. To combat this, Hase and Grizz embarked on [[building_a_shelter_with_limited_resources | building a more structured shelter]] by day three. They gathered pine needles using their jackets to insulate the shelter and protect against the cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Shelter Improvements and Adaptations

As the days passed, the duo’s initial makeshift setup proved inadequate, especially after unexpectedly harsh weather, including freezing rain. Motivated to survive, they took advantage of the situation by relocating near a newly discovered creek with fresh water and potential food sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Building an Upgraded Shelter

Grizz and Hase's upgraded structure was more resilient. They collected dead trees to [[strategies_for_overcoming_difficult_obstacles | form an A-frame shelter]], and for added comfort, lined it with pine needles over a parachute fabric. They also built a functional dock to facilitate fishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## Innovative DIY Projects

### Creating a Raised Bed

On day 28, the focus shifted to constructing raised beds for better sleep quality. The plan involved setting up a supportive structure with makeshift slats, intending to keep them off the cold ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Discovery and Use of Local Resources

Additionally, they leveraged the local flora to their benefit, attempting to find edible plants, although they were not always successful. For instance, they tried eating Greenbrier leaves, which provided limited sustenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Challenges and Innovations

Throughout their time, Hase and Grizz faced numerous challenges, from the absence of fish to destructive elements that could compromise their efforts. Despite these hurdles, they [[using_creative_methods_to_complete_a_task | innovated by attempting to build a boat]] out of sticks and a tarp to facilitate access to more fruitful fishing areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## Conclusion

The duo’s ability to adapt and make use of the limited resources available was instrumental in extending their stay in the wilderness. Their creativity in shelter building and reliance on DIY methods not only ensured survival but also [[highstakes_challenges_and_prize_money | maximized their potential earnings]] in the wilderness challenge. This experience underscores the importance of resourcefulness and [[creative_problemsolving_and_resource_management_in_extreme_conditions | innovation when faced with nature's unpredictable challenges]].

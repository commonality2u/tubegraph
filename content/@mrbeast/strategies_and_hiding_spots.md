In a thrilling display of stealth and strategy, 100 subscribers were [[subscriber_participation_in_challenges | gifted $10,000 each]] and locked inside one of the world's largest malls in a [[hide_and_seek_game | competitive hide-and-seek challenge]] hosted by the YouTuber, MrBeast. The challenge entailed evading capture for a full 10 hours, and those who succeeded were allowed to keep the money. This article explores the diverse and creative strategies utilized by participants as they navigated the sprawling expanse of the mall.

## Hiding Spots: The Key to Survival

Participants chose a variety of unique hiding places throughout the large mall to avoid detection:

### 1. Utilizing the Mall's Attractions
Several contestants took advantage of the mall's attractions. One participant, aware of the size and complexity of the Toys "R" Us section, hid among the toys and other concealed nooks. This area offered numerous dark corners and objects to hide behind, providing an effective cover for those seeking refuge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### 2. High and Low Spots
The mall’s construction offered both high and low hiding opportunities. Contestants discussed climbing ladders, aiming to reach hidden ceiling panels, acknowledging that such risks could potentially secure an undetected spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Conversely, others chose to remain closer to the ground, such as hiding behind vending machines and in dark alcoves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### 3. Becoming Part of the Environment
Some contestants displayed ingenuity by blending into their surroundings. An early discovered participant transformed into a mannequin, making them harder to spot in a store filled with such figures. This strategy underscores the value of [[using_creative_methods_to_complete_a_task | adaptation and utilizing existing elements]] to one's advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Strategies for Outlasting the Hunt

In addition to selecting effective hiding spots, participants employed strategic movement and alliances to prolong their concealment:

### 1. Strategic Movement and Decoys
Quick decision-making and agility played crucial roles in evading capture. For instance, during the search, one contestant ran straight into other hunters while attempting to escape, taking advantage of the confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Moving only when necessary, and at the right moments, often determined the survival of these contestants.

### 2. Utilizing the Mall’s Layout
The grand and often complex layout of the mall served as both a challenge and an asset. Each level offered potential hiding spots, and by leveraging the confusion inherent in such a vast environment, contestants could redirect search efforts and avoid detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### 3. Misleading the Hunters
Some participants cleverly misled the hunters, such as feigning innocence or providing false information about their own or others' locations, to minimize focus on certain areas or themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### 4. Building Temporary Forts
Resourceful contestants created makeshift hiding spots like forts within existing spaces, providing a temporary but effective barrier against discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

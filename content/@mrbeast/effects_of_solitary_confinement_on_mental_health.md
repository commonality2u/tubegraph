Solitary confinement is a distressing practice where an individual is isolated in a small, confined space with limited interaction with others and minimal environmental stimuli. This extreme form of isolation has been shown to have profound effects on mental health, as explored in a YouTube video where MrBeast, a popular content creator, challenged himself to spend seven days in solitary confinement [[solitary_confinement_challenges|solitary confinement challenges]].

## Psychological Consequences

### Psychosis and Hallucinations

The lack of social contact and sensory input in solitary confinement leads to the brain generating its own stimulus, which often manifests as hallucinations, paranoia, and other mental health disturbances [[psychological_effects_of_isolation|psychological effects of isolation]]. The doctor in the video warns about the risks associated with extended periods of isolation, mentioning there's a real chance of slipping into psychosis after about 50 hours, which can lead to permanent damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Insomnia and Anxiety

The challenge highlighted how the constant, harsh conditions of solitude affect sleep patterns. MrBeast reported severe insomnia, attributing it to the disruptive environment, including bright lights which distorted his sleep-wake cycle [[challenges_of_prolonged_isolation|challenges of prolonged isolation]]. This lack of sleep led to increased anxiety, as seen in his growing fear of missing out on life outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Loss of Time Perception

One significant outcome of the experiment was the loss of time perception [[understanding_time_perception_in_isolation|understanding time perception in isolation]]. Deprived of normal temporal cues, MrBeast quickly lost track of how much time had passed, resulting in confusion and further exacerbating stress levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Feelings of Loneliness and Depression

The absence of human interaction induced profound loneliness and depression in MrBeast. He expressed feelings akin to being stripped of his basic human rights, emphasizing the emotional toll of isolation [[emotional_impacts_of_prolonged_separation|emotional impacts of prolonged separation]]. His mental state declined significantly, notably when he began dreaming of normal life outside, only to awaken back to reality in the solitary room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Coping Mechanisms

In an effort to distract himself and cope with the mental strain, MrBeast engaged in various activities such as counting tiles, inventing scenarios, and attempting physical exercises like handstands. However, these were often short-term solutions that were unable to fully mitigate the effects of the prolonged isolation [[coping_mechanisms_under_isolation|coping mechanisms under isolation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Solitary confinement, even for a short period, can have deleterious effects on mental health, contributing to various disorders and emotional disturbances. The challenge undertaken by MrBeast vividly illustrates the psychological risks associated with isolation [[psychological_impact_of_confinement|psychological impact of confinement]], underscoring the necessity of addressing and mitigating these issues in contexts where confinement is used.

This experimentâ€™s insights reveal the profound necessity for human interaction and stimuli in maintaining mental wellness and highlight the urgent need for reform where solitary confinement is practiced [[isolation_experiment_dynamics|isolation experiment dynamics]].

In this thrilling episode, the pursuit of a $100,000 bounty leads to a series of ingeniously designed obstacle courses that not only challenge the participants but also showcase the creativity and resourcefulness necessary in high-stakes scenarios. Each section of this chase serves as a testament to the art of constructing effective and innovative obstacles.

## The Car Chase Strategy

The chase begins with a traditional high-speed car pursuit, but with a twist. To throw off the bounty hunters, a tactical decision is made to switch vehicles at a dealership. The vehicle switch introduces an element of unpredictability and forces the pursuers to adapt quickly. This segment demonstrates how changes in transportation can serve as a strategic obstacle in evasion scenarios.

## Bank-Grade Vault Scenario

One of the standout obstacles is a bank-grade vault placed in an isolated warehouse. This element adds a psychological barrier for the hunters, who must navigate the mystery of the vault without direct access. Unknown to the hunters at first is the secret tunnel escape route, which amps the challenge by blending physical and tactical obstacles.

## Movie Theater Deception

A movie theater becomes the setting for another creative diversion. With the entire theater rented out, the potential hiding spots are numerous. The cat-and-mouse dynamic heightens as the pursuers navigate decoy setups, like strategically placed recordings and hiding in non-obvious spots like beneath the theater floor.

## Field Diversions with Helicopter and Porta-Potties

In a remarkable mix of logistics and showmanship, an open field is transformed into an elaborate obstacle course featuring a helicopter and porta-potties as distractions. This segment pushes creativity to new heights by proposing an aerial decoy using a helicopter to lift a porta-potty, tricking hunters into false assumptions about the protagonist's location.

The use of multiple getaway vehicles like boats emphasizes the planning and resourcefulness involved in crafting such comprehensive escape paths.

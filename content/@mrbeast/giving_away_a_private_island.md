To celebrate reaching an impressive milestone of 100 million subscribers, MrBeast, the popular YouTuber known for his extravagant stunts and generous giveaways, decided to take it up a notch. He announced a competition that would gift one lucky subscriber a private island. This exciting event unfolded over a series of intense challenges, where only the strongest competitor would emerge victorious.

## The Challenge Breakdown

In this celebratory video, MrBeast brought together 100 subscribers to compete in a series of extreme challenges, with each round designed to eliminate a portion of the participants until only the best remained.

### Challenge 1: Starting a Fire
The first challenge was deceptively simple—participants needed to start a fire and light a torch. The first 50 contestants to achieve this moved on to the next round. This task, while straightforward in concept, was a test of both skill and determination, as indicated by MrBeast's commentary that it was expected to take around 20 minutes on average, though some completed it quicker than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Challenge 2: Red Light, Green Light
The second challenge was a nostalgic nod to MrBeast's most-viewed video inspired by the "Squid Game" series [[recreation_of_squid_game_sets]]. In this version of "Red Light, Green Light," only the first 20 contestants to cross a red line could advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The twist? It took place in the middle of the ocean, adding an extra layer of difficulty and excitement.

### Challenge 3: Plank Walk on a Pirate Ship
From 20 contestants, only 10 could proceed. This challenge took place on a pirate ship, where participants had to choose and stand on planks—half of which would drop them into the ocean. This challenge emphasized MrBeast's knack for combining thrill with high stakes [[high_stakes_adventures_with_surprising_twists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Final Challenge: Finding the Play Button
The final showdown involved finding a 100 million subscriber play button, hidden on the island. The winner would not only find the button but also the deed to the island, granting them ownership of the private oasis [[exploring_features_of_a_250_million_private_island]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Also, a notable twist was where the earliest subscriber was given the unfortunate task of cutting the 20 remaining contestants down to half, emphasizing the unpredictable and strategic aspects of the game [[psychology_and_group_dynamics_in_competitions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## A Decision to Remember

Before the final challenge, each finalist faced a personal dilemma: take a guaranteed $50,000 or continue competing for the private island. Remarkably, all chose to continue, highlighting their confidence and determination to own an island [[decision_making_and_honesty_in_high_stakes_situations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

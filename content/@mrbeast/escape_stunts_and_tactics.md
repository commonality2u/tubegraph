In one of MrBeast's thrilling videos, Jimmy Donaldson (MrBeast) showcased his ability to stage elaborate escape stunts with meticulous planning and execution. The video pits MrBeast against a hired "assassin," where the challenge is for the assassin to [[hiring_an_assassin_for_a_challenge | tag him with a rubber knife]] by the end of the day to win $100,000. Let's explore the well-thought-out tactics used for escaping the assassin.

## The Setup

MrBeast ingeniously sets the premise by giving the assassin a rubber knife and a means to track his immediate location [00:00:03]. While this ups the ante for the assassin, it also sets the stage for MrBeast to use a series of escape stunts across various locations.

## The Train Station Hideout

The adventure begins in a train station warehouse filled with multiple train cars, creating a labyrinthine environment challenging for anyone pursuing him [00:00:47]. The primary tactic here was to exploit the environment's complexity to buy time, similar to [[observational_strategies_in_contained_environments | strategies used in other maze-like settings]].

## Tank Tactics

One notable escape stunt involved the use of a tank to [[using_vehicles_for_dramatic_escapes | destroy the car]] provided to the assassin [00:01:18]. The action not only delayed the assassin but also showcased a bold tactic of removing the pursuer's mobility in the pursuit.

## Hotel Hijinks

In another layer of his escape plan, MrBeast secured an entire hotel floor and scattered over 200 room keys to mislead the assassin [00:04:45]. This move created confusion and delay as the assassin and team were forced to search through multiple rooms, a tactic akin to [[unique_hotel_themes_and_features | unique hotel challenges]].

The elaborate setup also included a hint system, where the assassin had to perform a task—tying up MrBeast's friends—to get a hint about his precise location [00:04:59].

## Luring to a Vault

In a dramatic twist, MrBeast led the assassin to a [[bank_vault_challenges | bank vault]], setting a trap with a fake vault to ensure he was secured in a separate location long enough to execute the final escape stunt [00:08:00]. This strategic move was one of the most critical in ensuring the success of the escape.

## The Carnival Decoy

Finally, as the showdown approached its finale, MrBeast constructed an entire carnival as a massive distraction [00:10:46]. At this location, MrBeast pretended to suffer an injury in an attempt to test the assassin’s resolve and ethics, deciding to continue the challenge while appearing to be compromised. It was a daring gamble leveraging the assumption that the assassin might hesitate due to potential injury.

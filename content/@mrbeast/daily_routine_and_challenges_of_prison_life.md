In the recent video experiment where Jimmy and his friends spent 50 hours in a real prison, they experienced the harsh realities and challenges faced by prisoners daily. This article explores the routine and hardships encountered during their incarceration [[experience_of_being_in_a_maximum_security_prison | in a maximum security setting]] [00:00:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">`00:00:00`</a>).

## Introduction to Prison Life

Upon entering the prison, Jimmy and his friends were treated exactly like inmates. They were subjected to authentic prison routines, including the consumption of prison food [[prison_meals_and_living_conditions | similar to what inmates eat]], performing cleaning duties, and enduring the mental strain of confined life [[psychological_impact_of_confinement | impacting their mental health]] [00:00:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">`00:00:22`</a>).

## Daily Schedule

### Morning Routine

Wake-up calls were abrupt, often around 3:00 a.m. for roll call, ensuring that no prisoners had escaped during the night. The lack of personal autonomy affects decision-making [[decision_making_and_honesty_in_high_stakes_situations | under pressure]] [00:01:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">`00:01:35`</a>). Post roll call, the inmates were given a short amount of time to dress and prepare for the day [00:01:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">`00:01:55`</a>).

### Meals

Prison meals were basic and repetitive. The participants rated their inaugural prison breakfast as a mere four out of ten, highlighting the blandness and lack of appeal of typical prison food [[prison_meals_and_living_conditions | experienced]] [00:02:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">`00:02:12`</a>).

## Prison Duties

### Cleaning

Inmates were responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of their cells. The video participants experienced the difficulty of performing cleaning tasks while shackled, illustrating the degrading conditions imposed on prisoners [[psychological_effects_of_confinement | psychological effects]] [00:04:22](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">`00:04:22`</a>).

### Kitchen Duty

Jimmy and Nolan found themselves on kitchen duty, tasked with preparing meals for other inmates. The monotonous job emphasized the lack of freedom and the routine nature of prison life, similar to [[competition_among_friends | competition routines with friends]] [00:04:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">`00:04:36`</a>).

## Recreational Time

Prisoners were granted limited recreational time, where they could partake in activities like playing cards or basketball. However, this time was closely monitored, and privileges were quickly revoked for bad behavior [[strategies_for_facing_challenges | presenting a challenge]] [00:06:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">`06:00:00`</a>).

## Challenges of Prison Life

### Mental Strain

The constant surveillance and lack of personal space were mentally taxing. Nolan's solitary confinement highlighted the extreme isolation faced by prisoners as a punitive measure, emphasizing the [[psychological_effects_of_isolation | effects of isolation]] [00:05:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">`00:05:56`</a>).

### Physical Discomfort

Prison conditions were far from comfortable. The participants dealt with hard beds, cold showers, and basic amenities, all contributing to the overall discomfort, a contrast to [[luxury_amenities_on_highend_yachts | high-end amenities]] [00:00:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">`00:00:33`</a>).

### Lack of Autonomy

Prison life stripped individuals of personal autonomy. Inmates had no say in their daily schedule, meals, or even when they could sleep or shower, accentuating their powerlessness, akin to [[isolation_experiment_dynamics | dynamics in controlled environments]] [00:01:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">`00:01:58`</a>).

In an exhilarating segment of the video, the creators embarked on an ambitious experiment to simulate the impact of a meteor hitting a house. This was part of a larger series of extreme experiments conducted for entertainment and curiosity [[challenges_and_competitions]].

## The Setup

To recreate a realistic scenario in which a meteor hits a house, the team constructed a scale replica of the house featured in the [[unique_hotel_themes_and_features | video game "Hello Neighbor 2"]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">00:04:26</a>]. The video game was used as a thematic backdrop, enhancing the immersive experience of the simulation. The team also created lifelike mannequins of themselves, which were strategically placed within the house to assess the potential survival of the occupants in different hiding spots [[hide_and_seek_game]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">00:04:38</a>].

## Objective

The primary aim was to discover the safest location in a house during a meteor impact [[survival_strategies_in_closed_environments]]. The participants placed mannequins throughout the house, including spots like the trunk, the couch, and even attempted to hide on structures that could potentially withstand the meteor's force [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">00:04:42</a>].

## Execution

Three meteors were employed for the experiment. The first meteor was dropped without additional variables, providing an initial test of impact [[testing_the_safety_and_durability_of_highend_cars]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">00:05:01</a>]. Subsequently, the second meteor was set on fire before being released to add a realistic element of additional destruction, simulating the heat generated by meteors as they enter the Earth's atmosphere [[fireworks_and_dynamite_experiments]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">00:05:32</a>].

## Results

- The first impact significantly damaged the house but failed to dislodge one mannequin, showcasing potential survival depending on the hiding spot [[successful_completion_of_a_highstakes_challenge]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">00:05:09</a>].
- The second, fiery meteor compounded the destruction but left one mannequin unscathed, demonstrating the unpredictability of meteor impacts and protective structures [[psychological_effects_of_confinement]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">00:05:54</a>].
- The third and final meteor sealed the destruction, obliterating any remaining structural integrity, and raising questions about effective preparation for such astronomical threats [[dangers_and_risks_of_extreme_challenges]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">00:06:06</a>].

## Conclusion

While the experiment was conducted primarily for entertainment, it inadvertently emphasized the unpredictable nature of meteor impacts. It provided an interesting insight into potential survival strategies during such calamitous events [[survival_challenges_in_a_confined_space]]. This extreme exercise in plausibility illustrated that, while entertaining, real-life precautions and emergency strategies would be essential in the case of an actual meteor redemption [[psychological_impact_of_isolation_in_a_competitive_challenge]].

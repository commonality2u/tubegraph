Pranks have evolved from simple tricks to complex, science-themed setups. This article delves into a unique prank involving the use of "elephant toothpaste", as witnessed in the video where MrBeast surprises his brother with an over-the-top prank. Let's explore what elephant toothpaste is, how it was used in the prank, and the science behind its comedic spectacle.

## What is Elephant Toothpaste?

Elephant toothpaste is a foamy substance that results from the rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide using a catalyst like potassium iodide or yeast. The reaction produces a large amount of oxygen gas, which causes soap mixed in the solution to form an abundant, foamy eruption. It's often used in science demonstrations to create visually stunning results.

## The Setup: A Prank within a Prank

In the video, the plan was to prank CJ, MrBeast's brother, while he was pranking someone else. CJ was supposedly covering Karl's house with sticky notes; however, he was unaware that his own house was being filled with elephant toothpaste as a counter-prank orchestrated by MrBeast [[surprising_a_sibling_with_a_new_house | surprising a sibling with a new house]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Execution: Elephant Toothpaste in Action

In preparation for the prank, MrBeast partnered with Mark Rober, an expert with world records in creating elephant toothpaste eruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The video shows the gradual build-up leading to the moment when the prank is executed, filling CJ's house with tones of foamy substance sufficient to blow out doors and windows [[working_with_experts_for_pranks | working with experts for pranks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

The prank involved using approximately 500 gallons of hydrogen peroxide, nearly doubling the existing world record for the largest elephant toothpaste reaction [[challenges_and_creativity_in_extreme_automotive_protection_scenarios | challenges and creativity in extreme automotive protection scenarios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. The foam, as a result, erupted out of CJâ€™s house, creating a chaotic yet hilarious scene.

## Safety and Precautions

The spectacle demonstrated involved careful scientific calculations to ensure safety. Given the exothermic nature of the decomposition reaction, participants observed a rise in temperature and copious steam generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Safety protocols emphasized distance from the reacting mixture to avoid exposure to high heat and potential surface damage from the foam [[strategies_and_teamwork_in_competitive_challenges | strategies and teamwork in competitive challenges]].

## Conclusion: The Heart of the Prank

Ultimately, the prank underscored a balance of harmless fun and the power of scientific principles brought to life in an engaging way. While the prank appeared destructive, it was all conducted under controlled conditions, with careful considerations to restore any impact on the house and, importantly, build a positive post-prank outcome by gifting CJ a new house as compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

In this playful yet intricate prank, the highlight remained how science can be leveraged for entertainment, offering real-world applications for a seemingly educational experiment.

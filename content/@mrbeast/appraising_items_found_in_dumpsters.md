Each item they found was appraised by a professional to ascertain its market value.

### Methodology of Appraisal

A professional appraiser accompanied the contestants throughout the challenge. His role was to evaluate the condition and potential resale value of each item found. The appraiser's judgment played a crucial role, providing clear valuations that ranged from a few cents to several dollars, depending on the item's condition and functionality.

### Notable Finds and Their Values

The appraisal process revealed some intriguing finds:

- **Furniture and Appliances**: These were among the most lucrative items. For example, a luxury suitcase was appraised at $5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, while a guitar was valued at $90, assuming its electronics were functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Factors Affecting Appraisal

The appraising process took into account various factors:
- **Condition**: Items in good repair received higher valuations. 
- **Functionality**: Usable and working items, especially electronics, had considerable value.
- **Market Demand**: The appraiser also considered current market demands, particularly for trendy items like calculators and tech accessories.

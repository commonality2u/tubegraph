In one of the most exhilarating experiments featured in this segment, the team embarked on a daring mission: attempting to see if a car fitted with ten jet engines could [[unique_vehicles_with_special_capabilities | fly over a lineup of buses]]. This experiment followed a previous endeavor where a car was equipped with a single jet engine and successfully jumped over eight buses, raising the stakes significantly this time around. 

## The Setup

The experiment involved mounting ten jet engines on a specially modified car, with the goal of it soaring much further than its predecessor. The over-the-top setup was aimed to test the limits of the vehicle's capability and see if it could [[testing_the_safety_and_durability_of_highend_cars | potentially reach an impressive distance]] by jumping over a series of twelve buses. As one of the hosts put it, "When this car flies off this ramp, I think it's gonna go past all the buses into the trees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Expectations

Each team member had differing expectations about the car's potential performance. Opinions ranged from those predicting that the car might crash into the first bus to predictions of it achieving a significantly greater jump. This diversity in expectation set the stage for an exciting and unpredictable outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a> [[psychology_and_group_dynamics_in_competitions | illustrating the psychology and group dynamics involved]].

## The Moment of Truth

With a go-ahead signal, the car was launched down the ramp with thrilling speed. As the car took flight, the suspense was palpable. The result was astonishing â€“ the jet-powered vehicle not only cleared all twelve buses easily but also left [[strategy_and_tactics_for_endurance_challenges | a crater on the road where it landed]]. The test was a phenomenal success that exceeded expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Aftermath 

Following the successful jump, viewers could see the aftermath, where parts of the engine were left smoking on the road. The sheer force of the jump had displayed just how much power those ten jet engines exerted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

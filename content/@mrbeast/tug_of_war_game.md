In one of the most thrilling segments from Mr. Beast's real-life recreation of Squid Game, the iconic Tug of War challenge was brought to life. This segment involved 120 eager participants who were whittled down to just 60 by the end of the game. Here's a detailed breakdown of this intense part of the competition.

## Setting up the Game

After completing the [[honeycomb_challenge | honeycomb challenge]], the contestants, originally starting as a group of 456, were asked to form teams of ten for the upcoming Tug of War game. The stakes were high, as the winning teams would continue in the pursuit of the grand prize: $456,000.

Each team required not only brute strength but also strategic planning. As one contestant pointed out, "We needed the strongest people and the smartest people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, highlighting the necessity for a balanced group dynamic to ensure victory [[psychology_and_group_dynamics_in_competitions | psychology and group dynamics in competitions]].

## The Competition

Once teams were formed, Mr. Beast began the process of randomly selecting matchups. The first matchup pitted Team 6 against Team 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. The rules were simple and mirrored the original show: if a team pulls their opponents into the foam pit or drags the opposing team's flag across the center line, they win the game [[tugofwar_contests_with_prize_money | Tug-of-War contests with prize money]].

As the competition commenced, the enthusiasm and the anxiety were palpable. Team 5 emerged victoriously in the first matchup, sending Team 6 into elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a> [[elimination_drama_in_competitive_events | elimination drama in competitive events]].

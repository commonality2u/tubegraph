In a video featuring some of the most daring experiments ever captured on camera, one experiment stood out for its audacity and scale: testing the durability of safes against explosives. This article delves into the fascinating details of this high-stakes experiment that raised the question of [[decision_making_and_honesty_in_high_stakes_situations | whether a safe can truly protect against a massive explosion]].

## Setting Up the Experiment

The experiment involved three safes, each varying in cost and presumably in strength: a $1,000 safe, a $10,000 safe, and a $100,000 safe. The goal was to determine if these safes could protect fragile contents, represented by a simple egg, from the destructive power of corresponding amounts of TNT.

### The $1,000 Safe Test

The initial test involved the smallest and seemingly weakest safe, priced at $1,000. A proportional amount of explosives, also worth $1,000, was used for this phase. The result was immediate and catastrophic for the egg inside, which "literally don’t exist anymore" after the explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### The $10,000 Safe Test

For the second test, the stakes were raised with a $10,000 safe, protected by ten times more explosives than the previous test. This safe boasted three-inch-thick steel walls and was enveloped by the explosives like "presents around a Christmas tree" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. When detonated, the explosion was so intense that it left a divot in the ground and shattered the glass of the yet-untested $100,000 safe nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### The $100,000 Safe Test

Finally, the pièce de résistance of the experiment—a $100,000 safe surrounded by the same value in explosives. This, the crew claimed, was [[largescale_explosions_and_experiments | the biggest explosion they had ever attempted]]. The question of whether this expensive fortress could protect its egg became an "age-old" curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

With $100,000 in explosives encircling it, the explosion was expectedly colossal, sending shockwaves that were felt across the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. However, despite the safe's imposing door and formidable build, its defenses fell short in areas it mattered the most—the back and sides. The aftermath revealed a critical fault; the back of the safe blew out, its structural integrity compromised, and notably, the egg did not survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Conclusions

The experiment demonstrated the sheer destructive power of explosives and highlighted limitations even in high-cost safety measures under extreme conditions. While fascinating, these demonstrations also implicitly underscore the need for realistic expectations regarding the protective abilities of safes against powerful explosives. The video concludes humorously, suggesting one could [[protecting_money_from_tnt_explosion | rob a bank with enough TNT]], a jest that encapsulates the thrilling spectacle of the experiment.

In essence, this experiment with safes and explosives provides an unforgettable visual on the limits of conventional security measures when faced with overwhelming force. Each test revealed not just the power of the explosion, but also the critical need for comprehensive design in protection technologies.

In this high-stakes challenge video produced by MrBeast, contestants were offered an opportunity to win increasing amounts of money by completing a series of challenging trick shots. Here's a closer look at some of the most notable contestants and outcomes from the video.

## Contestant Highlights

### Drake's Basketball Shot
Drake was the first contestant in the video, challenged to make a basketball shot from a 250-foot bridge for $10,000. Despite his confidence and quick attempt, the ball missed its mark, adding $10,000 to the prize pool for the next contestant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Adam and the Dart Bullseye
Adam was tasked with hitting a bullseye with a dart for $20,000. Against all expectations, Adam managed to get close, but ultimately missed the bullseye by a narrow margin, increasing the prize pool further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Dave's Golf Challenge
Dave, a familiar face from a [[youtuber_competition_for_prize_money | previous video]], was given another chance at glory. He had to make a hole in one for $40,000, mimicking a past challenge where he was only six feet from winning a million dollars. Unfortunately, despite the pin's favorable relocation, Dave missed again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Tariq's Soccer Shot
In the fifth challenge, Tariq was asked to replicate Carlâ€™s successful trick shot by kicking a soccer ball into a trash can from a significant distance for $50,000. Despite his efforts, Tariq could not complete the challenge, resulting in the prize carrying over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### The Baby Cannon Contest
On a football field, contestants had the chance to win $70,000 by launching a baby doll from a cannon into a crib. Despite the entertaining demonstration by Chris, the actual attempt missed the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Remarkable Victories

### The Half Court Victory
In a gym setup, the stakes reached $200,000, to be split among five participants if any could make a half-court shot. After four attempts resulted in near misses, the final contestant managed a miraculous basket, earning each participant $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

### The Helicopter Shot
One of the most ambitious challenges involved a contestant taking a shot from a [[unique_vehicles_with_special_capabilities | helicopter]] for $100,000. Despite the high difficulty and added pressure as the helicopter ascended, mostly for dramatic effect, the participant's attempt narrowly missed the basket, leading to a tense moment of anticipation and subsequent disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

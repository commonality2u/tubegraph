Surviving on a deserted island presents a unique set of challenges, one of which is dealing with harsh weather conditions. In the video documenting a seven-day [[survival_strategies_on_a_deserted_island | survival challenge]], the team faced multiple weather-related adversities that tested their endurance and adaptability. Here's how they managed to cope with these challenges.

## Initial Preparations and Shelter Building

The team recognized early on the need to prepare for potential adverse weather. [[building_a_shelter_with_limited_resources | Upon arrival, they started building a shelter]] to shield them from the elements. As one of the members put it, "It's hot out here. We need to build a shelter immediately" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This urgency underscores the importance of having a reliable shelter in such unpredictable environments.

## Night-Time Surprises

Despite their efforts, the first few nights were tumultuous due to unexpected rain and challenging conditions such as insect bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The rain often coincided with their attempts to rest, which exacerbated their difficulties: "Why is it that whenever we do survival videos, it literally only rains when we're trying to sleep?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Adapting Shelter for Weather Conditions

Realizing their initial shelter was insufficient, the team worked on upgrading it to make it rainproof. One key improvement involved ensuring better water runoff: "We need more comfortable seats because my butt hurts and we need a better fire pit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. They focused on using long, sturdy sticks to fortify the shelter, aiming for a design that would let rain flow off rather than accumulate.

## Encounters with a Storm

The imminent approach of a storm forced the team into action. Despite forecasts suggesting it wouldn’t rain, [[strategy_and_tactics_for_endurance_challenges | they acted immediately]] upon seeing threatening clouds: "The forecast said it wasn't supposed to rain. There's monster clouds over there. We need to prep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Preparing for such weather involved securing their possessions and adding more layers to their shelter canopy.

## Dealing with a Rain-Soaked Night

Later in the week, a more severe storm struck at night, severely testing their improved shelter. Water began pooling on the roof, threatening the structural integrity of their camp: "All this water on top of us, is there a world that could bring our structure down?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. Despite exhaustion, they had to manage the situation proactively to prevent the collapse of their shelter.

## Coping Mechanisms and Group Support

Enduring harsh weather took a toll on the team’s morale and physical well-being. [[emotional_impact_of_competitions_on_participants | The experience was demoralizing]]: "I don't know that I've ever been that cold ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. However, they managed to persevere by supporting each other and finding moments of levity during their ordeal.

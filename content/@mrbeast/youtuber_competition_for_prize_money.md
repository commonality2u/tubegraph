In a groundbreaking event, 50 of the world's most subscribed YouTubers gathered to compete in an unprecedented challenge hosted by [[mrbeasts_creative_competitions | MrBeast]]. The event, which featured participants with a combined subscriber base of over 1 billion, offered a tantalizing prize: $1 million in cash awarded to the subscribers of the last YouTuber standing. This competition, streamed for millions worldwide, showcased tense moments of strategy, risk-taking, and alliances.

## The Setup

The rules of this competition were as challenging as they were thrilling. Participants were placed inside a cube, and the last to leave would secure the $1 million prize for their subscribers. The event was inspired by intense [[recreation_of_squid_game_sets | rivalry shows like "Squid Game,"]] igniting both camaraderie and competition among the YouTubers. The floor of the cube was marked with a red line, stepping on which would result in immediate disqualification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Challenges

Throughout the competition, contestants faced a series of intricate tasks designed to weed out the weak and reward the brave.

### Free Throw Challenge

The first challenge allowed YouTubers to step out of the cube temporarily to attempt a basketball free throw. A successful shot would earn a Tesla Cybertruck for a subscriber, and the participant could return to the cube. Failure, however, meant outright elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Despite the risk, a few YouTubers took the leap; some succeeded, while others faced a swift exit [[elimination_drama_in_competitive_events | exit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### The Dalgona Challenge

In a nod to the "Squid Game," the second challenge required YouTubers to carve specific shapes out of honeycomb toffee without breaking it. This task proved disastrous for many, as the fragile candy resulted in numerous eliminations [[honeycomb_challenge | eliminations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Giant Jenga

Another nerve-wracking segment was a giant Jenga game that paired YouTubers against each other, resulting in an unexpected twist where losing partners attempted to drag each other down [[strategies_and_teamwork_in_competitive_challenges | down]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Culinary Skills Test

As the competition narrowed, participants faced a cooking challenge judged by celebrity figures like [[competitive_eating | Joey Chestnut]] and Miranda Cosgrove. This light-hearted yet competitive task tested their creativity and ability to work under pressure [[entertainment_value_of_reality_game_shows | pressure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

### The Final Game: Steal or No Steal

The climax of the contest was a high-stakes version of the "Deal or No Deal" game. Playing on [[decision_making_and_honesty_in_high_stakes_situations | deception and intuition]], YouTubers had to decide whether to steal briefcases, potentially containing an elimination mark or a chance to win. This game of bluffing made for a thrilling conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## The Winner

After multiple rounds of competition and intense psychological games, it was Jaiden Animations who emerged victorious. Her strategic acumen and calm demeanor won her the prize, which she plans to use towards [[charitable_intentions_with_prize_winnings | helping aspiring artists attend art school]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

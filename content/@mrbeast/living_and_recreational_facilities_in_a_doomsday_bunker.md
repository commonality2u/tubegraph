In recent years, interest in doomsday bunkers has grown significantly, with many curious about what life could entail in such an environment. One such fascinating example is an abandoned missile silo, initially built in the 1950s to withstand nuclear strikes, which has been transformed into a [[features_of_a_luxury_doomsday_bunker | 14-story luxury underground bunker]]. This elaborate complex provides everything one might need for an extended stay away from the world, whether the apocalypse is nigh or just for an eccentric retreat. 

## Essential Living Spaces

The primary purpose of any doomsday bunker is to ensure the safety and continued survival of its inhabitants. To this end, each floor is ingeniously designed to cater to various needs:

- **Residential Levels**: Each condo in the bunker spans across several floors and comes with creature comforts that make it feel like a typical home. Costing between $1 million and $2.5 million, these units can comfortably accommodate up to ten people. Remarkably secure, each unit is surrounded by nine-foot thick walls, ensuring utmost protection. The condos even feature windows that project real-time videos of the outside world, simulating a sense of normalcy despite being deep underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Self-Sustaining Resources

Self-sustainability is key in a bunker. To achieve this, the facility includes:

- **Food Supply and Aquaponics**: A floor is dedicated to the cultivation of various plants and aquaponics. The system ensures a steady supply of fresh produce and fish. The aquaponics setup ingeniously uses fish waste to nourish plants, which in turn contribute to the fish's food supply, creating a [[selfsustaining_food_systems_inside_the_bunker | self-reliant ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Recreational Amenities

Ensuring mental well-being is as important as physical health. Therefore, the bunker incorporates a range of recreational facilities:

- **Theater**: An entire floor is devoted to leisure with a full-fledged movie theater. Watching films like the "Bee Movie" makes quarantines or lock-ins entertaining for all ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

- **Fitness Center**: To prevent the health issues associated with prolonged inactivity, there is a well-equipped gym. Alongside traditional workout machines, the gym is complemented by a sauna for relaxation and recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Leisure Activities

A variety of pastimes are available to maintain morale:

- **Friendly Competitions**: Residents can engage in games like ping pong and pool. Notably, competitive games like chess are often accompanied by friendly wagers, adding excitement to bunker life [[psychology_and_group_dynamics_in_competitions | psychology and group dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

Laura Deming, co-founder and CEO of Cradle, a startup focused on [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | human whole-body reversible cryopreservation]], is also a venture capitalist specializing in anti-aging and life extension technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. She founded The Longevity Fund, which has since been superseded by Age One, where she is a co-founder and partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Sociopolitical Implications of Longevity

If substantial advancements in longevity science lead to average human lifespans and healthspans of 150 to 200 years, there are several non-obvious societal changes to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

### The Value of Extended Life

One compelling argument for extended longevity is the potential for individuals to reach higher levels of creative and intellectual development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Hokusai, the artist of "The Great Wave off Kanagawa," created his most famous work in his 60s or 70s and felt he was only just beginning to learn how to draw, wishing to reach 100 to truly draw things that were alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. This illustrates the depth and originality that can emerge from a lifetime of dedicated practice and evolution of a conscious entity over a long period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. For scientists, extended lifespans, coupled with sustained health and mental plasticity, could allow for greater achievements, avoiding productivity declines seen in figures like Einstein who experienced illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.

### Behavioral and Economic Impacts

From a game theory perspective, an unknown, very long period of time in society might incentivize more pro-social behavior, as agents would benefit from cooperation in an iterated game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

However, a potential negative consequence of extended longevity is exacerbating inequality. The first generation to achieve significantly longer lives could gain an "insane advantage" by having much more time to compound capital, shifting the advantage from youth to being born earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. This might necessitate new societal structures or wealth taxation to mitigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

Regarding societal dynamism, there's a concern that extended lifespans could lead to a less dynamic society if longer-living individuals, shaped by their youthful formative experiences, retain their worldviews, reducing turnover in positions and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. However, this may not be a significant issue, as society already sees shifts in culture and influence, similar to how musical styles replace dominant sounds, even if artists continue to produce music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.

## The Nature of Aging and Intervention

The field of [[philosophical_implications_of_longevity | longevity]] includes a fundamental question: what aspects of self do we want to preserve over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>? The concept of "identity change" is relevant, akin to a "hero's journey" where individuals transform through profound experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. The question then becomes whether an individual is open to such changes, guided by certain principles, to maintain "continued relevance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

### Programmed vs. Random Aging

A surprising but true fact about aging is that single gene changes in many organisms can significantly alter lifespan, sometimes by an insane multiple in small organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>. For example, interventions in the worm *C. elegans* can increase its lifespan by up to sixfold, and in mice, by approximately 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. While the translatability of these findings to humans is not yet known, it suggests a non-zero, potentially controllable component to aging, contrary to the default assumption of it being solely a system breaking down randomly over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>. This is strange because biological systems are incredibly complex, with trillions of atoms interacting in complex ways, making simple changes that alter the entire system surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.

### Regulatory Challenges

A major [[innovation_challenges_and_the_role_of_regulation | regulatory bottleneck]] for longevity drugs is the lack of a clear "aging" indication and the long timelines for review cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>. Currently, there's no way around running very large, difficult, and expensive trials for the first longevity drugs to demonstrate lifespan extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>. While future biomarkers might serve as quicker proxies, they are not yet sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>. Reducing review cycles from six months to weeks for preclinical companies would significantly help by reducing timeline uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>.

## Future Directions: Cryopreservation and Beyond

### Why Cryopreservation?

Despite a broad view of emerging technologies in longevity, Laura Deming chose to work personally on [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]] because it is intensely fascinating, impactful, technically tractable, and severely underworked on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>.

*   **Impact:** Reversible cryopreservation (medical hibernation) could bridge the gap to future therapies for terminal illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. It offers a "one-way time machine" to access future medical advancements, making it highly leveraged as a single problem solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53">[01:10:53]</a>.
*   **Tractability:** It allows for deep interfacing with engineering and physics, utilizing a full spectrum of ideas to develop new solutions, unlike many other biological problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. This "pausing" category of intervention feels more tractable than restoring, replacing, or delaying aging because it is more fully defined and offers more avenues to plug in physics and engineering tools for leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>.
*   **Underworked:** The field is underworked, largely due to it being perceived as "too weird," carrying a lot of "baggage" that creates a force field around the idea, deterring serious work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>. It runs counter to many intuitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>.

### The Role of Imagination in Scientific Insight

Laura Deming advocates for "embodied thinking" or "world simulation" as a way to gain scientific insights and foster "scientific awe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:11">[03:00:11]</a>. This involves using imagination to place oneself within a scientific context, like a cell, and interacting with it based on known physical laws, allowing for a dynamic exploration that mirrors reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:36">[03:38:36]</a>. This practice helped her internalize the strangeness of [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]]'s possibility, realizing that cells' reliance on passive diffusion and their robustness to thermal noise makes them uniquely amenable to freezing and rewarming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:43">[04:42:43]</a>. Biology and physics are particularly amenable to this mode of thinking, while mathematics feels more foreign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:23">[04:26:23]</a>.

The experience of scientific awe is a personal priority, with Deming tracking 512 hours of being in this state since 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:13">[03:41:13]</a>. This state is fostered by being in a grassy, open environment, listening to music, consuming sugar, and engaging with well-developed mental objects (like cell biology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:04">[03:32:04]</a>. It is viewed as an end in itself, a "hedonistic" and spiritual experience tied to a deep sense of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:13">[03:41:13]</a>.

### Investment Trends in Longevity

Early investments by Longevity Fund focused on companies that resembled normal biotech firms but had a strong link to aging biology, aiming to provide examples that the biotech field would understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>. Over time, it became clear that the most successful companies were highly founder-oriented, pursuing "moonshot ideas" from their early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. This indicates a shift towards backing visionary founders tackling ambitious goals within the longevity space.

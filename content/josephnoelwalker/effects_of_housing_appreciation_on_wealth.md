Initially, there was a belief that making credit easier, especially for housing, would allow people to benefit from [[historical_context_of_the_housing_crisis | house appreciation]], thereby increasing their wealth and financial portfolios [00:00:10]-[00:00:27]. This approach was also thought to alleviate concerns such as job insecurity or inadequate human capital [00:00:31]-[00:00:39].

## Expansion of Property Ownership and Credit
The idea of expanding property ownership was supported by both political spectrums [00:00:43]. The right viewed having more property owners as a positive development [00:00:46]-[00:00:51]. Similarly, the left desired workers to own their homes to become wealthier [00:00:51]-[00:00:57]. This led to a convergence of views on the need to expand housing credit [00:00:57]-[00:01:03].

## Risks and Negative Outcomes
While the expansion of housing credit was seen as a good idea within limits [00:01:07]-[00:01:11], it eventually became an excessive movement [00:01:11]-[00:01:14]. Providing too much credit too easily can be detrimental [00:01:18]-[00:01:22]. Individuals who received credit at the wrong time, particularly as prices were rapidly increasing, faced harm [00:01:22]-[00:01:29]. They might not have been able to afford the houses or the consumption that drawing on home equity made possible [00:01:32]-[00:01:38].

A significant issue arose when people drew down on their home equity lines, only for prices to collapse, leaving them with no equity and deep debt [00:01:41]-[00:01:47]. This highlights the [[consequences_of_borrowing_against_home_equity | consequences of borrowing against home equity]].

## Political Influence and The Illusion of Wealth
Politicians faced pressure to take action if incomes were not growing [00:01:50]-[00:01:54]. Expanding housing credit served as a way to keep people content [00:01:57]-[00:01:59]. When incomes stagnate, the only way to increase consumption is through debt or equity [00:02:02]-[00:02:06]. Rising home prices created the illusion that individuals were not borrowing but merely drawing down on equity they already possessed [00:02:10]-[00:02:18]. The term "draw down" sounded better than "borrowing" [00:02:25]-[00:02:28]. However, in reality, people were borrowing against appreciation that was becoming increasingly fragile, as it was based on a speculative bubble [00:02:31]-[00:02:39].

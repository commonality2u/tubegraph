Katalin Kariko's research aimed to create therapeutic protein-coding RNA without inflammatory molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This goal led to a critical question: why was the RNA produced in the lab inflammatory, unlike the RNA found inside cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>? The hypothesis was that synthetic RNA caused inflammation because it was introduced from outside the cell to immune cells, where RNA is not typically found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Investigating RNA Immunogenicity

To understand the difference, a comparison was proposed: isolate RNA from human cells and observe its effect on human immune cells (dendritic cells) versus the effect of *in vitro* (made in a tube) RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Initially, researchers expected all RNA to activate an immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Various types of RNA were tested, including Transfer RNA (tRNA), ribosomal RNA, and different bacterial RNAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## The Key Discovery: Non-Immunogenic Transfer RNA

A significant finding emerged: Transfer RNA (tRNA) did not induce any immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This led to the breakthrough thought that tRNA, which is known to contain the most modified nucleosides, might be non-immunogenic due to these modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

> "We didn't set out goal to make a non-immunogenic RNA. We had no idea that there is such thing exist. We just wanted to understand that is it the RNA I make synthetically is any different what is inside the cell." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>

The core objective was to determine if synthetically made RNA differed from cellular RNA in its immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The method to prove this involved isolating RNA from cells, making RNA in a tube, and observing how cells responded to both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Most RNAs, both synthetic and those released from the body's own cells during injury, were found to induce an immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

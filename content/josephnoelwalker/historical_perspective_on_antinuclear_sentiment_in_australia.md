Historically, Australia has experienced significant [[reactions_to_australias_potential_nuclear_developments | anti-nuclear sentiment]], with notable [[reactions_to_australias_potential_nuclear_developments | anti-nuclear campaigns]] active in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Initial Expectations

When the AUKUS security pact was announced, there was an expectation that these [[reactions_to_australias_potential_nuclear_developments | anti-nuclear campaigns]] would intensify, particularly given the implications for Australia's stance on nuclear power and potentially [[public_opinion_on_australia_acquiring_nuclear_weapons | acquiring nuclear weapons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. However, this expected resurgence of popular opposition did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. There has been a lack of significant public reaction to the idea of Australia utilizing nuclear reactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, leading to the perception that Australians have become more "relaxed" about nuclear power than previously assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This shift in [[impact_of_aukus_on_australias_stance_towards_nuclear_power | public opinion]] post-AUKUS was unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Public Opinion Nuances

In 2022, a [[low_institute_poll_on_nuclear_weapons_support_in_australia | Lowy Institute poll]] revealed that approximately 36% of Australians either supported or strongly supported the US acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. When interpreting such [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons_in_australia | poll results]], it's important to consider that survey questions are typically presented without counterfactuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For instance, Australians are usually asked if they want nuclear weapons without being presented with potential costs or trade-offs (e.g., "if it costs this" or "if it means getting less of that") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. They are simply asked a direct question about their preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

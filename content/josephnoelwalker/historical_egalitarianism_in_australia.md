Australia's culture is defined by its [[cultural_dimensions_of_egalitarianism | egalitarianism]], a characteristic that has been prominent for at least the past 150 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This ethos of [[cultural_dimensions_of_egalitarianism | egalitarianism]] solidified into a national identity around the 1890s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Paradoxically, this period was marked by significantly higher [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | economic inequality]] than is seen today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Origins of Egalitarian Culture

Several factors are believed to have contributed to the development of Australia's [[cultural_dimensions_of_egalitarianism | egalitarian]] culture:

*   **Labor Scarcity and Land Abundance**: In the early days of the colony, labor was scarce, and land was plentiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This imbalance gave workers a more even balance of power with capitalists compared to Europe or North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Employers could not mistreat workers because there were few available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, leading to the early formation of trade unions and the emergence of the 8-hour day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Influence of Benthamite Utilitarianism**: While setting up political institutions, Australia was influenced by Jeremy Bentham, leading to a political culture with more [[influence_of_benthamite_thinking_on_australian_politics | Benthamite utilitarianism]] than Gladstonian liberalism seen in other former colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **The Gold Rushes**: The gold rushes were a moment when wealth was largely determined by luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This shook up existing hierarchies, as success depended on the chance of finding gold rather than skills or social standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The Gold Rush era also led to massive immigration, tripling Australia's population in a decade and creating significant social fluidity and mixing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This allowed workers to establish a society around their preferences, in contrast to older, more entrenched hierarchies found in European societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Characteristics of Australian Egalitarianism

Australian [[cultural_dimensions_of_egalitarianism | egalitarianism]] manifests in several observable behaviors and attitudes:

*   **"Jack is as Good as His Master"**: This notion, which emerged from the country's unique historical context, suggests that an ordinary person is not only equal to but perhaps even superior to their superiors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **"Tall Poppy Syndrome"**: While often complained about more than truly observed, this concept suggests that success does not lead Australians to put individuals on a pedestal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Informal Interactions**:
    *   Australians typically do not stand when the Prime Minister enters a room, a simple yet significant difference from many other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
    *   The term "mate" is used widely, conveying an egalitarian flavor, even across gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. An attempt by the Department of Parliamentary Services to ban security guards from calling parliamentarians "mate" generated bipartisan outrage and was quickly reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
    *   Australians commonly sit in the front seat of taxis, which is not the norm in countries where a chauffeur approach holds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Lack of Private Beaches**: There are no private areas on Australian beaches; individuals cannot buy a chunk of land to make private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Post-Office Titles**: Unlike in the US, where former presidents are still called "President," Australia generally does not refer to former Prime Ministers by their title after they leave office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

## Egalitarianism and Economic Inequality

Despite its strong cultural [[cultural_dimensions_of_egalitarianism | egalitarianism]], Australia has experienced periods of significant [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | economic inequality]].

*   **Late 19th and Early 20th Centuries**: Australia was characterized by stark social disparities, with a higher share of domestic servants than the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. By 1910, the top 1% of personal income earners received 12% of all personal income, and the top 0.1% received 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Post-Federation Trends**:
    *   From Federation (early 1900s) through to the 1970s, [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | inequality]] fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   From the 1980s to today, [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | inequality]] has risen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, although it is not quite as high as in the 1910s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   The share of Australian wealth held by the top 200 individuals has increased fivefold, and the share held by the top 20 has increased ninefold over the last couple of decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. This, along with increases in expenditure, income, and wealth [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | inequality]], strains Australian [[cultural_dimensions_of_egalitarianism | egalitarian]] values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
*   **Drivers of Inequality Since the 1980s**:
    *   **Technology and Globalization**: These have increased returns for "superstars" across various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.
    *   **Reduction in Union Membership**: Union membership has fallen from half the workforce in the early 1980s to about one in eight today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.
    *   **Reductions in Top Tax Rates**: These correlate strongly with [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | inequality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.
    *   **Housing Market**: The massive bull market in Australian housing has increased wealth [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | inequality]] by raising the gap between those who own property and those who do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. The time it takes for a typical Australian worker to buy a typical house has increased from four years post-WWII to 11 years currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

## Egalitarianism and Innovation

There is debate about whether [[cultural_dimensions_of_egalitarianism | egalitarian]] culture, particularly the "tall poppy syndrome," might hinder innovation by discouraging risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Australians are more fearful of business failure than Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

However, policies that promote [[cultural_dimensions_of_egalitarianism | egalitarianism]] can also foster innovation:

*   **Social Safety Net**: Providing a social safety net encourages people to take risks, knowing they can fail and restart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Broadening Opportunities**: Creating educational opportunities for disadvantaged individuals and providing funding/mentorship to entrepreneurs from unconventional backgrounds can increase innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>.
*   **Education**: An "education boom," where increasing numbers of people finish school, attend vocational training, and go to university, is a powerful force for [[cultural_dimensions_of_egalitarianism | egalitarianism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. Australia's education boom was delayed compared to the US, helping to mitigate the increase in [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | inequality]] from the computer revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

## Government Role and Social Safety Net

The Australian government plays a significant role in maintaining [[cultural_dimensions_of_egalitarianism | egalitarianism]] through its social safety net and policies.

*   **Redistributive Social Safety Net**: Australia's social safety net is highly redistributive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. It gives 12 times as much welfare to someone in the bottom fifth of the distribution as to someone in the top fifth, making it one of the most efficient redistributive systems globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>. This system relies on means testing and, for pensions, assets testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Community and Opportunity**: Progressive governments aim to create more educational opportunities, including access to TAFE and university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. Efforts are made to ensure equality across schools and attract more first-in-family students to universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.
*   **Addressing Teacher Quality**: The academic aptitude of teachers declined after the 1970s and 1980s when gender pay discrimination in other professions reduced, allowing talented women to enter fields beyond teaching and nursing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. Policies now focus on appropriate remuneration for teachers, reducing paperwork burdens, and ensuring a flexible and appropriate curriculum to attract and retain high-quality educators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.
*   **Market Competition**: Uncompetitive markets are seen as detrimental to both growth and fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. Monopolies can transfer income from many consumers to a few wealthy shareholders, worsening [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | inequality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

## Future Challenges

While Australia's [[cultural_dimensions_of_egalitarianism | egalitarian]] culture remains strong, its long-term endurance is challenged by rising [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | economic inequality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. The increasing wealth concentration could strain the nation's core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. There is also a recognition of the "tyranny of merit," where educational attainment is seen as a moral justification for success, potentially leading to resentment among those with less formal education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. Policymakers aim to address this by emphasizing the role of luck in career outcomes and focusing on creating broad opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.

The concept of the "Great Stagnation" describes a period in the Western world, starting around 1973, where productivity growth rates slowed significantly, and wages began to rise more slowly, or not at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This phenomenon also saw a clear slowdown in innovation outside the tech sector, and science itself appeared to slow down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. These concurrent trends have resulted in significantly lower living standards than if the higher rates of economic growth had continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

## Origins and Causes of the Great Stagnation

The exact reasons for the 1973 breakpoint are not definitively known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Proximate Cause:** The immediate trigger was the oil price shock of 1973, which harmed economies and productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. However, productivity did not fully recover even after oil prices fell, making it one of the great mysteries in modern economic history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Contributing Factors:** Several factors are believed to have converged, piling on top of each other:
    *   Increased societal regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
    *   Increased risk aversion among people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
    *   More "veto points" in decision-making processes in most Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
    *   The shift of more of the economy into sectors like healthcare, which can contribute to a productivity slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.
    *   Aging populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

### Distinguishing from Secular Stagnation

While "Great Stagnation" focuses on supply-side issues like slowed productivity growth, Larry Summers' "secular stagnation" reinterprets the slowdown as primarily a demand-side problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. The argument that a collective spending binge could end it is contested, as issues like private debt are seen as merely transferring money, not draining it from the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>. A higher marginal propensity to invest by savers, while potentially leading to slower overall investment returns, is not viewed as inherently negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.

## Measuring the End of Stagnation

A key metric to determine if the Great Stagnation has ended would be consistently rising [[factors_contributing_to_income_inequality | real wages]] for most income classes over a period of five to ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. In addition to wage growth, assessing the state of science and technology itself would also be important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

### Current Status and Outlook

As of late 2020, the Great Stagnation persists by the measure of sustained rising wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. While the U.S. experienced robust wage growth for a year or two, and [[economic_reforms_in_australia | Australia]] and Canada had longer periods, the latter is attributed to selling resources to [[uschina_economic_and_military_dynamics | China]], not technological breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

There is a possibility that the Great Stagnation is currently ending, obscured by the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Developments in areas like SpaceX, biomedicine (e.g., vaccine speed), Tesla's value, and solar power/battery prices suggest a potential shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

### Slowdown in Science and Technology

There's evidence suggesting [[limits_to_technological_and_scientific_progress | science has been slowing down]] in general, based on metrics such as:
*   Difficulty in maintaining Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
*   Diminishing rates of increase in crop yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.
*   The increasing number of scientists required to achieve a given advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

However, the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines is cited as one significant recent example where scientific progress has notably accelerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

## Implications of Stagnation

### Shift to Zero-Sum Thinking
A significant concern of prolonged stagnation is the potential for societies to shift from positive-sum thinking to zero-sum or even negative-sum thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. This shift is currently evident as many economies shrink and politics become more contentious, leading to a sense of "fighting over scraps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. This phenomenon is supported by the argument that successful democracies often require a surplus to maintain consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. Historical parallels suggest that pre-industrial revolution societies, where the main resource (land) was finite, also exhibited zero-sum thinking, which limited the development of liberalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

### Housing Bubbles and Debt
The Great Stagnation is seen as a partial deep cause of housing bubbles in the 2000s, especially in the Anglosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. As incomes slowed, policymakers tended to "juice up credit" and stimulate the housing market, contributing to real estate bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. The belief that growth would continue at high rates also encouraged borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

The idea that the 2006 U.S. housing market was a "bubble" is debated, with some arguing that current values exceed those peaks, suggesting that the subsequent market crash was more of an "anti-bubble" panic based on a mistake about the stability of the banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>. However, regionally, genuine bubbles did exist, particularly in places like Las Vegas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>.

In [[economic_reforms_in_australia | Australia]], the political class became aware of the importance of rising house prices and capital gains to their constituencies by 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. Despite consistent calls of a bubble, Australia's strong fundamentals, including significant land availability for population growth, make a bearish case hard to see <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.

To prevent future crises, a focus on ensuring banks and financial institutions are well-capitalized is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>. This approach appears to have been largely successful since 2008, as financial systems have held together relatively well despite the COVID-19 shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>.

## Impact of COVID-19 on the Stagnation Thesis

The pandemic has revealed significant dysfunction in U.S. institutions, exceeding prior pessimistic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>. Conversely, U.S. biomedical research institutions have proven far more effective and quicker than anticipated, as seen with vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
The U.S. has ramped up mass testing, but its decentralized and politically polarized society struggles with effective follow-up like trace and track, which is critical for control, as demonstrated by countries like Australia's state of Victoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

Countries in Northeast Asia (and New Zealand) have significantly outperformed Western nations in managing the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>. This success is attributed to:
*   Effective governmental structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.
*   Preparedness from previous SARS crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.
*   Different cultural notions of privacy and deference to authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.
*   A regular familiarity with existential threats, fostering a mentality that doesn't take macro success for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

Other factors like differing cross-immunities due to exposure to earlier coronaviruses may also play a role in some regions' lighter impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. The final assessment of which countries handled the pandemic well will only be clear in hindsight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.

Ultimately, America needs a safe and effective vaccine distributed efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:41">[01:24:41]</a>. Beyond that, it requires stronger social capital, a realistic understanding of its global standing, a better strategy for [[uschina_economic_and_military_dynamics | dealing with China]], addressing its numerous checks and veto points in the system, and fostering [[economic_freedom_and_political_systems | freer markets]] with less government regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:14">[01:25:14]</a>. A greater willingness to be philosophical and learn from other cultures is also essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:43">[01:25:43]</a>.

At the University of Pennsylvania, faculty members in non-tenure positions faced specific requirements to establish themselves and secure continued employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Research Assistant Professor Position

One such position was that of a research assistant professor, which is a non-tenure track role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Individuals in this role had the opportunity to establish their own laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, establishing oneself in this capacity required securing external funding, often through research grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The challenges included [[challenges_in_acquiring_research_grants | failing to secure grant money]] after repeated applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## "Up or Out" Rule

The University of Pennsylvania had a policy stating that if a faculty member in a non-tenure track position did not "establish" themselves within five years, typically by securing sufficient grant funding, they would face a critical decision point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This rule mandated that such individuals either be promoted to a tenure-track or permanent position or be "kicked out," meaning demoted or removed from the faculty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Application of the Rule

For one research assistant professor, the rule led to their removal from the faculty in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This individual had consistently sought grant funding from 1989, submitting proposals monthly in the initial years of their appointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Despite proposing novel ideas, such as the use of circular RNA as early as 1992-1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, these proposals were rejected. Reasons for rejection included criticisms that the RNA would not be useful or that there was insufficient data, and at times, questions about the researcher's knowledge in conducting the experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This reflects common [[criticism_and_feedback_on_rna_research_proposals | criticism and feedback on RNA research proposals]] at the time. The inability to secure funding within the five-year timeframe ultimately resulted in the application of the "up or out" policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

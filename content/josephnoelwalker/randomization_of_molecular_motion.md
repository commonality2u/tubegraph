In a cell, molecules are constantly in motion, akin to a bag of molecules being shaken all the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Within this dynamic environment, nothing is guaranteed to remain in a particular place unless it is very strongly bonded there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This contrasts sharply with how humans typically design objects, which are usually incompatible with such a high degree of internal disorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Cryopreservation

This inherent property of cells, where molecules bounce about in random directions, is key to understanding how cryopreservation is even possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Cryopreservation involves cooling tissues, such as resected brain tissue, to temperatures of minus 130Â°C and below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### The Factory Analogy
Imagine a complex factory where everyone is stopped, spun around, and then told to walk in completely random directions at their normal speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This scenario is analogous to cryopreservation, which randomizes the molecular motion of all molecules when subjected to very low temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Cellular Invariance

Despite this induced randomization, cells possess unique properties that make them remarkably [[invariance_of_cells_to_environmental_changes | invariant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Cells are designed to operate through passive diffusion, relying on molecules bouncing about in random directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This fundamental operational mode means they are well-suited to handle the kind of molecular randomization that cryopreservation induces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This cellular characteristic makes it incredibly strange that cryopreservation and rewarming are possible at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Evolutionary Basis

The ability of cells to function effectively amidst such constant internal motion is linked to their evolution. Cells evolved to operate with very high amounts of [[thermal_noise_and_cellular_evolution | thermal noise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This evolutionary adaptation has endowed them with properties that make them exceptionally robust and [[invariance_of_cells_to_environmental_changes | invariant]] to the randomization induced by processes like cryopreservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It would be considered strange to expect similar resilience from other systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

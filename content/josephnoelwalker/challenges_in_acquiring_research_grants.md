An individual recounted their struggles to secure research grants during their early career as a research assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, starting in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Persistent Grant Applications

From 1989, for the first two years, the individual wrote a grant application every month to secure funding and establish their lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Despite proposing novel research, such as the use of circular RNA (which was considered a new concept even in 1992-1993) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, none of these initial proposals were successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Reasons for Rejection

The feedback received on the rejected proposals highlighted several issues:
*   **RNA instability** The RNA was deemed "labile" (unstable), suggesting it would not be useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Insufficient data** The proposals lacked enough supporting experimental data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Questioning of expertise** Reviewers sometimes questioned the researcher's knowledge required to conduct the proposed experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Responding to Feedback

Rather than concluding that the reviewers were unintelligent, the individual chose to interpret the rejections as an indication that they had not explained their ideas sufficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This led to efforts to improve writing skills, seeking feedback from colleagues, and conducting more experiments to generate additional data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Career Implications

The University of Pennsylvania had a policy that if a faculty member did not establish themselves by securing grants within five years, they would either be promoted or removed from their faculty position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Due to the inability to secure grants, the individual was removed from their faculty position in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

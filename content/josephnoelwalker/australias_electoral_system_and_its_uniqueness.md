Australia's voting system stands out among English-speaking democracies due to several distinctive features in its structure and administration of elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Unlike most anglosphere countries where voting is voluntary and first-past-the-post systems are the norm, Australia employs compulsory preferential voting and holds elections on Saturdays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Australia was also the first country to establish an independent and professional electoral administration, having been electoral innovators since the mid-19th century, most notably inventing the Australian ballot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Historical and Cultural Roots

Australia's distinctive electoral system and political culture are deeply rooted in its history and philosophical influences.

### [[benthamite_influence_on_australian_political_institutions | Benthamite Influence]]
Australia's political culture is often described as majoritarian and bureaucratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. H.W. Arndt referred to Australia as a Benthamite society, influenced by Jeremy Bentham's brand of utilitarianism, which was the prevailing political philosophy when Australia set up its political institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. In contrast, the United States was influenced by John Locke and social contract theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Key examples of this influence include Henry Chapman, who designed the secret ballot in Victoria, and Catherine Helen Spence, whose ideas on proportional representation were influenced by John Stuart Mill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Unlike Locke's view that rights exist prior to government, Bentham saw rights as being given by government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This perspective aligns with Australia being set up by the British government, focusing reformers on making the government more responsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The Chartist movement (1830s), advocating for manhood suffrage and the secret ballot, also influenced many immigrants to Victoria, including Henry Parkes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### [[australias_state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | Trust in Government and Low Taxation]]
Another contributing factor to Australia's unique political culture was that for about the first 100 years of its history, the British government largely funded Australia's colonial governments, resulting in comparatively low taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This contrasts with America's experience of "taxation without representation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Australians developed an attitude towards government as a benevolent entity that "just gave you stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

W.K. Hancock observed that Australians viewed government as a "large public utility for the service of individual interests," not primarily as a coercive power to be constrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Government financed and built essential infrastructure like railways, unlike in America where private enterprise dominated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. It also assisted a lot of migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This reliance fostered a trust in government as potentially benevolent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### [[historical_and_cultural_roots_of_australian_egalitarianism | Egalitarianism and Obedience to Impersonal Authority]]
Two dominant and long-running strands of Australian political culture are its egalitarianism and obedience to impersonal authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. [[historical_and_cultural_roots_of_australian_egalitarianism | Egalitarianism]] may stem from an early labor shortage giving workers more power than their English counterparts, or from the Gold Rushes which "shook up" and diluted traditional hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This egalitarianism was most evident in informal manners, where people disliked "putting on side" and the wealthy couldn't automatically expect deference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

Australians, while individualistic, are generally obedient to institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This blend of egalitarianism and obedience to impersonal authority was "consummated in the bureaucratic state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Bureaucracies, being impersonal and rule-bound, are inherently meritocratic and democratic, opposing status based on birthright or personal networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. To create an egalitarian society requires high levels of redistribution, which in turn necessitates a bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

## Key Electoral Innovations and Their Evolution

### [[the_role_of_compulsory_voting_in_australia | Compulsory Voting]]
Australia's [[the_role_of_compulsory_voting_in_australia | compulsory voting]] system, while a unique feature, is both a cause and consequence of its majoritarian political culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Proposals for [[the_role_of_compulsory_voting_in_australia | compulsory voting]] emerged in Australian colonies in the late 19th century, with arguments primarily focusing on ensuring the government had the support of the majority of eligible voters, not just those who turned out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Philosophical arguments against it, based on liberty or individual conscience, were rarely raised, unlike in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

The Labor Party initially opposed [[the_role_of_compulsory_voting_in_australia | compulsory voting]] until compulsory voter registration was introduced in 1911 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Labor prioritized ensuring all itinerant workers could register and vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. A unique aspect of the Australian system, championed by Labor, was the ability to vote at any polling booth in one's state, reflecting a focus on the individual voter rather than residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

When the [[the_role_of_compulsory_voting_in_australia | compulsory voting]] bill finally passed in 1924, it was preceded by only about an hour of debate in the Senate, with only one senator (a Labor anti-conscriptionist) speaking against it, albeit ultimately voting with his party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. This highlights its uncontroversial adoption. The inevitability of [[the_role_of_compulsory_voting_in_australia | compulsory voting]] largely came after compulsory and permanent voter registration was in place, making it administratively feasible and ensuring accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. Bureaucrats also favored it to maximize the benefit of their extensive work maintaining the electoral roll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>.

Currently, [[the_role_of_compulsory_voting_in_australia | compulsory voting]] remains very popular and is unlikely to be abolished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>. It is seen as a stabilizer, preventing parties from focusing on highly emotive issues solely to "get the vote out" and encouraging a more "sensible, levelheaded" vote from the moderate middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>.

### [[the_development_and_impact_of_preferential_voting_in_australia | Preferential Voting]]
[[the_development_and_impact_of_preferential_voting_in_australia | Preferential voting]] is considered as much an agent of Australia's majoritarian culture as [[the_role_of_compulsory_voting_in_australia | compulsory voting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. The Barton government's original Electoral Act proposal in 1902 included [[the_development_and_impact_of_preferential_voting_in_australia | preferential voting]] for the House of Representatives and proportional representation for the Senate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. However, first-past-the-post was used until 1918 for the House, and block voting for the Senate until 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

The initial drive for [[the_development_and_impact_of_preferential_voting_in_australia | preferential voting]] came from farmers' organizations in the 1910s, worried about splitting the non-Labor vote in three-corner contests and allowing Labor representatives to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>. This shows how identifiable interest groups could influence the electoral system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>.

[[the_development_and_impact_of_preferential_voting_in_australia | Preferential voting]] has allowed various political groups, such as the Democratic Labor Party (DLP) and Pauline Hanson's One Nation, to exist and exert political pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>. Coupled with proportional representation in the Senate, it creates flexibility in the political system by allowing minority interests to be represented and stay engaged, rather than being "smothered over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>. This is particularly important in Australia's increasingly complex and diverse society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. The trend shows an increasing number of House of Representatives seats now going to preferences (e.g., 102 out of 150 in 2016) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:35">[00:51:35]</a>.

### Universal Manhood Suffrage
Australia inadvertently achieved near-universal manhood suffrage by the 1850s, largely due to two "accidents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. First, while New South Wales recommended a £20 minimum property qualification, England decided on a lower £10 threshold, partly to reduce the influence of wealthy ex-convict families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. Second, the Gold Rushes caused significant inflation, pushing many men above this minimum property threshold and enfranchising them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Without the Gold Rushes, the universalization of manhood suffrage would likely have been slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.

### Disenfranchisement and Re-enfranchisement of Aboriginal People
Aboriginal people were not disenfranchised in New South Wales, Victoria, or South Australia prior to Federation, and they did vote in those states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. When South Australian women gained the right to vote, so did Aboriginal women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>.

The 1902 Commonwealth Franchise Bill, introduced by the Barton government, did not initially disenfranchise Aboriginal people, but it did disenfranchise non-white immigrants from Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands (excluding Māori) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>. During parliamentary debates, an amendment led to the disenfranchisement of Aboriginal people, particularly "full Bloods" or where "Aboriginal blood predominates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. This was not a contingency but a result of prevailing racist views, administrative concerns about counting Aboriginal populations in remote areas, and the ongoing violence on the frontier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.

Section 41 of the Constitution stated that nobody who could already vote in a state election could lose their vote when moving to the new Commonwealth, a clause primarily designed to guarantee voting rights for South Australian women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. Consequently, Aboriginal people already on state electoral rolls before 1902 retained their vote, but they effectively "fell out of the political system" as electoral officers interpreted rules in a racially exclusionary manner and it was difficult for others to register <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.

Aboriginal people finally gained the right to vote in federal elections in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>. It's suggested they could have gained it decades earlier if a High Court challenge had been mounted, similar to a case in the 1920s where an Indian man successfully challenged his disenfranchisement, leading to an exclusion for Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>. The lack of such a challenge for Aboriginal people highlighted their "marginal position" in the thinking of the political elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.

## Contemporary Reflections and Future Considerations

### Trust in Institutions
Surveys indicate a declining trust in Australia's political institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>. This is linked to increased inequality over recent decades, particularly since the 1980s and the rise of neoliberalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>. Neoliberal policies, such as the privatization of state-owned utilities, dismantled parts of the traditional bureaucratic and egalitarian system, shifting resources from government towards markets and leaving many vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:43">[01:13:43]</a>. Rising property prices have also significantly increased generational inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>.

### Role of Independent Members and Parties
The rise of independent members (like the "teals") and minor parties (like the Greens) in the House of Representatives reflects a shift in political dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. As major parties' memberships have shriveled and they have become more focused on leader control, they are less effective at aggregating diverse interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>. The presence of a strong crossbench and the Senate's independent majority since the early 1980s mean governments must negotiate on legislation, fostering a more parliamentary rather than rubber-stamp environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:48">[00:50:48]</a>.

### Potential Reforms and Challenges
*   **Fixed-Term Parliaments**: All Australian states and territories now have fixed-term parliaments, but the federal government still operates on a three-year floating term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>. Moving to a four-year fixed term would give governments more time to implement legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>.
*   **Voting for Permanent Residents**: New Zealand allows permanent residents to vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:17">[01:21:17]</a>. Australia could follow suit, as the 1902 franchise act only required six months continuous residence (apart from racial restrictions), and permanent residents pay taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a>. This could help integrate people committed to living in Australia but who haven't taken citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:15">[01:21:15]</a>.
*   **Technology in Voting**: Remote or online voting (e.g., "voting from home") is strongly opposed, as the act of voting is seen as a crucial "public act" that grounds citizens in their society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. While technology might help with counting, the "materiality" of voting is considered important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>.
*   **Misinformation**: The increasing influence of misinformation and fake news, combined with a decline in "rusted-on" voters who follow a party line, makes more people vulnerable to misleading content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:40">[01:10:40]</a>.
*   **Campaign Funding**: Debates continue regarding the funding of political campaigns, particularly concerning restrictions that may disproportionately affect independents compared to larger parties with national budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>.

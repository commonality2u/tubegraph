Historically, the United States saw significant internal migration, with people moving from low-wage areas, particularly in the South, to higher-wage regions like California throughout the 1940s, 50s, 60s, and 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. This movement was largely driven by individuals seeking higher pay and increased productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>, suggesting that moving to more advanced areas led to better economic opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. This phenomenon highlights [[historical_trends_in_us_internal_migration | historical trends in US internal migration]].

## Current Mobility and Urbanization Challenges

Despite persistent large productivity gaps between different regions of the United States, internal mobility has significantly declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. While high-skilled individuals still tend to move to high-productivity areas, low-skilled workers are observed moving in reverse, leaving high-wage cities like San Francisco for places with lower wages, such as areas in Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. This counter-intuitive trend is primarily attributed to the "enormous" housing prices in high-productivity areas, which often negate the wage gains for lower-skilled individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. This illustrates a key aspect of [[the_relationship_between_immigration_housing_and_economic_growth | the relationship between immigration, housing and economic growth]].

Current housing regulations play a significant role in limiting population density and development:
*   **Cities:** Skyscrapers are difficult to build due to regulations, and strict historic site preservation rules, as seen in San Francisco, further restrict tearing down old structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Suburbs:** Approximately 80% of residential land is reserved for single-family homes, making it difficult to build multi-family housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Minimum Lot Sizes:** Regulations often require excessive land for single-family homes, sometimes an acre or more, forcing people to buy land they do not highly value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

These regulations create a significant "zoning tax," which is the difference between market prices and the physical construction costs of housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This issue directly concerns [[zoning_regulations_and_their_impact_on_housing_supply | zoning regulations and their impact on housing supply]].

## The Impact of Housing Deregulation

Full housing deregulation in the US would lead to a more urbanized landscape, but also allow people to spread out, resulting in more "leg room" for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. In cities, even in expensive areas like Manhattan, deregulation could lead to more spacious and affordable apartments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Critically, deregulation could restore the historical tendency for workers of all skill levels to move to areas where their wages are higher, rather than being deterred by housing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

This perspective forms a necessary sequel to discussions on open borders, as allowing high immigration volumes necessitates housing deregulation to manage demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. While immigrants in the US currently move to areas with lighter regulations (like Texas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, a more widespread deregulation would maximize the gains for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The argument for deregulation is that it facilitates greater productivity by allowing people to relocate to areas where their skills are most valuable, much like immigrants moving from low-productivity countries to high-productivity ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. This demonstrates [[the_impact_of_housing_deregulation_on_urban_development_and_city_dynamics | the impact of housing deregulation on urban development and city dynamics]].

## Population Density and Fertility Rates

There is a debate about the relationship between population density and fertility rates. Some research suggests an association between higher density and reduced fertility, citing examples like Tokyo and Seoul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>. However, it's noted that high density typically co-occurs with high housing prices, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of density from affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>.

It is argued that:
*   Allowing cheaper suburban housing, particularly single-family homes, is likely to increase fertility rates as it provides more space and enables young adults to move out of their parents' homes earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   While a cultural shift towards prioritizing "a life of play" and entertainment, rather than having children, contributes to declining fertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>, economics, specifically housing affordability, is considered one of the "easier dials to shift" to counteract this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. This cultural aspect relates to [[cultural_evolution_and_demographic_transition | cultural evolution and demographic transition]].

## Long-Term Urbanization and Population Growth

Looking at the very long run, human history might inevitably move towards a planet where all available land mass is densified, potentially resembling a planet like Coruscant from *Star Wars* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:47">[01:42:47]</a>. This projection is based on the idea that despite current low fertility rates, life finds a way. Over centuries, genetic selection is expected to favor "pronatal" attitudes and preferences for having children, leading to a "transformation of human psychology" where liking children becomes as common as liking sugar today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:02">[01:43:02]</a>.

This shift would result in sustained high population growth, necessitating the use of all available space on Earth, including potentially draining large oceans for more land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:10">[01:44:10]</a>. While expansion to other planets is a long-term goal, the immense costs and physical challenges of interstellar travel make it a significant bottleneck, potentially taking tens of thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:17">[01:45:17]</a>. Therefore, the immediate future for massive population growth would involve extreme densification and utilization of Earth's resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:50">[01:45:50]</a>.

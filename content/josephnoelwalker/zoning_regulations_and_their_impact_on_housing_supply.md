For most of human history, essential goods were scarce and expensive. However, since the Industrial Revolution, innovation has led to increasing abundance and falling prices for many necessities. Housing, an exception to this trend, has seen its cost, particularly the land underneath structures, continuously rise while prices of other goods decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Australia's Housing Crisis
Over the last 25 years, Australia's house price-to-income ratio has roughly tripled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. According to the Demographia report, Sydney and Melbourne rank as the second and seventh least affordable cities globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This unaffordable housing market has led to significant [[economic_and_social_consequences_of_unaffordable_housing | economic and social consequences]], including:
*   People living far from productive jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   Enormous debt burdens or precarious renting conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Distances from friends and relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   Delayed family formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   Contribution to urban sprawl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Australia's housing crisis is considered "the defining social policy disaster of our times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The primary issue is a constricted housing supply, rather than a housing bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Causes of Constricted Housing Supply
The phenomenon of constricted housing supply is common across English-speaking countries, including the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Ireland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Potential reasons for this commonality include:
*   Higher rates of [[relationship_between_immigration_and_housing | immigration]], leading to stronger and clearer pressures for more housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   The English-speaking governmental and cultural tradition emphasizing local control, which grants neighboring residents significant influence over property development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

While there isn't one dramatic legislative change, zoning regulations started to become a problem in countries like Australia around the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. In Australia, this period saw significant population growth and increased car ownership, leading to inexpensive car-based sprawl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. As commutes lengthened, there was a shift towards building upwards instead of outwards, where zoning restrictions are more severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This has led to a situation where demand for housing has increased by about 3% a year, while supply has only increased by about 2% a year, causing prices to continually rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### NIMBYism and Motivations
The "Not In My Backyard" (NIMBY) phenomenon is a significant factor. Motivations for NIMBYism include:
*   **Home Voter Hypothesis:** Selfishly protecting home equity values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. While this is a factor, especially in political discourse, the speaker suggests it's often cloaked in other language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Politicians find it hard to argue for lower housing prices when the wealth of most voters is tied to home equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Neighborhood Defenders Hypothesis:** Altruistically protecting the amenity and local character of neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Statistics suggest this story is more important, as many renters also exhibit NIMBY tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This motivation often stems from a "fear of the unknown" and a [[status quo bias]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. People often change their minds once a development is built and they experience its benefits, like new cafes or better bus service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Dislike of new residents:** Existing residents may oppose new developments due to ethnic or class reasons, especially in mixed-race societies, though this is often not explicitly stated due to social unacceptability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

## Zoning Regulations for Reform
While not all zoning regulations are problematic (e.g., preventing adult stores next to preschools), some significantly restrict housing supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. The most impactful regulations on the "chopping block" for reform are:
1.  **Height Restrictions:** These are considered the worst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Building upwards, particularly around train stations, is crucial for increasing density without significantly changing the character of already busy areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This aligns with the "transport-oriented development" strategy pushed by NSW and Victorian governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
2.  **Heritage Restrictions:** While not as impactful as height restrictions, they are considered "pretty stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Current heritage laws extend far beyond protecting unusually old or attractive buildings, safeguarding entire suburbs of ordinary housing without considering costs or benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
3.  **Restrictions on Detached Houses:** Allowing medium and high-density housing where only detached (single-family) houses currently exist is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. New Zealand has led the world in changing zoning regulations to allow more townhouses, leading to a doubling of construction and price falls (e.g., ~28% in Auckland, ~21% in Lower Hutt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### Economic Impact of Zoning Deregulation
Research indicates that zoning can contribute significantly to house prices:
*   In Sydney, zoning's contribution to house prices was 42%, and 41% to apartment prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   In Melbourne, it was 41% for house prices and 16% for apartment prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

While these figures represent potential price reductions if markets were completely liberalized, current policy aims are more moderate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

## [[Potential solutions for increasing housing supply | Potential Solutions for Increasing Housing Supply]]
The National Cabinet's target of 1.2 million homes over five years is considered a sensible and feasible short-term objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. This target aims to sustain the previous peak construction rate seen before the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.
*   An increase of 200,000 homes above a baseline of 1 million homes (which is 2% of the national housing stock) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.
*   Roughly, every 1% increase in housing stock reduces the cost of housing by about 2.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   Therefore, the 2% increment targeted by National Cabinet could lead to a 5% reduction in affordability relative to a baseline where prices would otherwise trend upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. This is a modest but significant start to combat continually deteriorating affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

Achieving these targets requires local councils to approve more developments, specifically a block of flats in every third or fourth suburb every few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>. The New South Wales and Victorian governments are setting ambitious targets for councils, but the next step is to announce how these targets will be enforced, as councils may resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. Automatic remedies in legislation for councils that don't meet targets would make the process more secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.

### Long-Term Goals
While a complete liberalization of markets could lead to significant price reductions (e.g., 40% in Sydney), it would require a 10-20% increase in the housing stock, which would take 10-20 years if achieved at a rate of 1% increase per year above the current baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. This is seen as a very ambitious, long-term goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>. The goal is to make housing much more affordable, meaning lowering the ratio of prices or rents to incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

### Consequences of Inaction
If housing supply remains unresponsive, Australia risks facing severe [[economic_and_social_consequences_of_unaffordable_housing | consequences]] similar to cities like San Francisco, Manhattan, or London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. In these places, housing is often only affordable through inheritance or extreme wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>, leading to:
*   Terrible homelessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.
*   Severe social divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   Young and entrepreneurial people leaving, harming [[impact_of_housing_deregulation_on_productivity | productivity growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.
*   Increased inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

## Related Factors and Critiques
### The YIMBY Movement
The "Yes In My Backyard" (YIMBY) movement is a broad coalition united by the belief that more housing supply will improve affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. It has grown significantly in influence as a grassroots movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>.

### Agglomeration Gains vs. Affordability
A critique of the YIMBY movement is the tension between making housing more affordable by increasing supply and achieving agglomeration gains by densifying cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. Increased density and productivity (agglomeration gains) can make cities more attractive, leading to higher incomes that push up prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. However, economists argue that the supply effects on price generally dominate the agglomeration effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. While productivity is crucial for living standards, building supply is a slow means of achieving these gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. The core focus of the YIMBY movement remains improving affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

### Aesthetics and Architecture
A potential bottleneck for the YIMBY movement is its perceived neglect of aesthetics and architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. It is argued that if new mid-rises and high-rises were as beautiful as old heritage buildings, public acceptance would be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. For example, Paris is widely considered beautiful due to its consistent seven-story apartments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>. However, translating aesthetic preferences into legislation is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. More importantly, the current debate in Australia isn't about replacing beautiful old buildings but rather ordinary, unattractive commercial areas around train stations or suburban housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

Aesthetics in streetscapes are significantly influenced by trees, not just buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. Burying overhead wires during urban redevelopment projects, such as upzoning, can create opportunities to plant more trees, which are widely liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

### Tax Concessions (Negative Gearing & Capital Gains Tax Discount)
The impact of negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount on housing prices is often discussed. While the interaction of these policies (especially after the 1999 capital gains tax discount) disproportionately favored property, leading to a new fundamental value for housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>, their current effect on prices is small (estimated 1-4% of prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>. The larger driver of house price increases in the early 2000s, common across English-speaking countries, was falling global long-term interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. While there are good equity and fiscal policy reasons to revisit these provisions, they are not considered the main issue in current housing affordability discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.

### Financial System and Credit Access
The financial system's role in housing unaffordability and stability risks is also debated. While large collapses in housing values can have catastrophic effects (as seen in the GFC), the appropriate policy response is to ensure high capital requirements for banks, regardless of specific housing policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:39">[01:29:39]</a>. Expanding access to credit to buy houses can be welfare-improving in cases where financial regulations prevent mutually advantageous trades (e.g., people paying high rent but denied loans for lower mortgage payments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>. However, if credit is expanded, it should ideally be coupled with measures to boost supply or reduce other demand-side supports like first homeowner grants to avoid further affordability problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>.

### Interstate Migration and Free-Riding
Significant price differentials between cities can drive [[housing_costs_and_migration_patterns | interstate migration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. For example, if one state upzones and prices fall, it might attract people from other states, potentially offsetting some of the local price benefits. This highlights the need for central government coordination to encourage upzoning everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>. The departure of dynamic, entrepreneurial individuals from cities like Sydney due to high housing costs is detrimental to those cities' productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>.

## Political and Social [[challenges_and_strategies_in_addressing_housing_affordability_in_australia | Challenges and Strategies]]
A significant obstacle to better housing policy is "supply skepticism," where a third of the public believes extra housing supply will worsen prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>. This often stems from observing that new supply often appears in response to strong demand, leading to a correlation with higher prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>. Public intellectuals and policymakers need to explain that for a given level of demand, increasing supply will improve affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>.

While many Australians value home ownership for wealth accumulation, the desire for affordability for their children is a strong motivator for homeowners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:19">[00:52:19]</a>. They recognize that the current market locks out future generations and drives children away from their childhood neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>.

State governments historically lacked the political will to confront councils on development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>. However, current state governments in NSW and Victoria are committed to housing policies despite council opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>. Ensuring that remedies for non-compliant councils are pre-specified and automatic in legislation, rather than relying on political courage, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:56">[01:15:56]</a>.

### Developer Charges
Developer charges are seen as helpful because they allow decision-makers to factor in the costs of supplying housing in different locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:02">[01:35:02]</a>. It's relatively cheaper to supply housing in inner suburbs due to existing infrastructure, compared to outer areas where water and road costs increase with distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:31">[01:35:31]</a>. However, the costs of infrastructure are considered trivial compared to the demand-supply imbalance in inner suburbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:48">[01:36:48]</a>. The focus should be on building where people want to live (inner suburbs), not just where utilities are easy to connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:17">[01:37:17]</a>.

### Greenfield vs. Infill Development
While there's overwhelming excess demand for infill development in inner suburbs, allowing Greenfield development (building on the outskirts) is also important, especially in regional towns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:15">[01:39:15]</a>. In places like Byron Bay, land zoned rural is significantly cheaper than residential land nearby, leading to housing crises and long commutes for workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:46">[01:39:46]</a>. Allowing these towns to expand outwards would provide affordable housing close to centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:19">[01:41:19]</a>.

### Filtering Effect
Building housing anywhere, of any type, will make housing throughout the whole market more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:06">[01:42:06]</a>. This applies to different locations (inner city vs. outskirts), old vs. new, luxury vs. downmarket, and density vs. detached housing. Increased supply in one area creates substitutability, benefiting affordability across the entire market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:10">[01:42:10]</a>.

## Conclusion
Addressing Australia's housing crisis requires a sustained increase in housing supply, driven by significant [[housing_deregulation | deregulation]] of zoning laws. While challenges exist, particularly political will and industry capacity, modest but consistent progress can lead to improved affordability over time.

[[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | Cryopreservation]] is a process that enables the cooling and rewarming of biological matter, which is described as an "incredibly strange" phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. For context, this can involve cooling tissue, such as resected brain tissue, to temperatures of minus 130Â°C and below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Molecular Randomization

At its core, [[molecular_randomization_in_cryopreservation | cryopreservation]] works by [[effects_of_low_temperatures_on_cells | randomizing the molecular motion]] of all molecules at very low temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This concept is counter-intuitive when compared to how humans typically design objects and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Most human-engineered systems are incompatible with such randomization, as they are not designed to be invariant to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## How Cells Facilitate Cryopreservation

Cells, however, possess unique properties that make them suitable for [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. A cell can be conceptualized as a "bag of molecules" that is constantly being agitated, where molecules are not guaranteed to be in a specific location unless strongly bonded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Cells operate on principles of passive diffusion, with their molecules constantly bouncing in random directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This inherent characteristic means cells evolved to function with high amounts of thermal noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Consequently, cells possess properties that make them resilient and invariant to the kind of [[molecular_randomization_in_cryopreservation | randomization]] induced during [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

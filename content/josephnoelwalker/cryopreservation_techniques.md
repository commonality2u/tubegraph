[[Cryopreservation_and_its_applications | Cryopreservation]] is a process that involves cooling biological tissues to extremely low temperatures, such as minus 130Â°C and below, with the goal of preserving them for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The ability to [[cryopreservation_and_its_applications | cryopreserve]] and rewarm anything is considered "incredibly strange" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Nature of Cells and Molecular Motion

A cell can be conceptualized as a "bag of molecules" that is constantly being shaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Molecules within a cell are not guaranteed to be in a particular place unless they are strongly bonded there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This perspective helps explain why [[cryopreservation_and_its_applications | cryopreservation]] is even possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Cells primarily function via passive diffusion, with molecules bouncing about in random directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## How Cryopreservation Works

[[Cryopreservation_and_its_applications | Cryopreservation]] operates by randomizing the molecular motion of all molecules when subjected to very low temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This process can be likened to a factory where everyone suddenly stops, is spun around, and then walks in random directions at their normal speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## The Uniqueness of Cells for Cryopreservation

Most systems designed at the human scale are incompatible with this kind of randomization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>; they typically lack [[invariance_of_cells_to_environmental_changes | invariance to such randomization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. However, cells are uniquely [[invariance_of_cells_to_environmental_changes | invariant]] to these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

The effectiveness of [[cryopreservation_and_its_applications | cryopreservation]] is linked to the fact that cells evolved to function with high amounts of thermal noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This evolutionary adaptation has endowed cells with properties that make them highly resilient and [[invariance_of_cells_to_environmental_changes | invariant to the randomization]] induced by [[cryopreservation_and_its_applications | cryopreservation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. It would be unusual to expect this level of [[invariance_of_cells_to_environmental_changes | invariance]] in any other system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

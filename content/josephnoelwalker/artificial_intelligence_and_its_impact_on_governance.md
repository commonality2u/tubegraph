The emergence of increasingly powerful artificial intelligence (AI) systems, including large language models and autonomous agents, poses significant questions for the future of governance and public administration. Historically, technological advancements have reshaped the landscape of work and government, but the capabilities of advanced AI suggest a potentially transformative shift [00:02:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Historical Precedents of Technological Transformation

Past technological shifts offer a lens through which to consider the potential impacts of AI.

### Evolution of Office Administration
When Ken Henry joined the Treasury in 1984, typist pools were standard. These pools consisted of people whose entire workday was spent typing, including making duplicates for filing purposes [00:02:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The introduction of consumer software like Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word profoundly changed these roles [00:04:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Impact of Spreadsheets and Computing Power
Prior to spreadsheets, academics in the early 1980s, including Ken Henry, often used punch cards for computing, which involved feeding bundles of cards into computers with significantly less power than a modern mobile phone. This process was slow, often taking hours to get output and days to fix coding errors [00:04:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The advent of Lotus 123 spreadsheets, observed by Ken Henry in 1984, allowed complex economic models to be built from scratch in a matter of hours, a task that previously took a month [00:05:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The Treasury was among the first users of Microsoft Excel in Australia, leveraging its power to develop modeling capabilities for assessing changes to the tax system [00:06:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This capability was deemed indispensable for the introduction of the consumption tax in 2000 [00:10:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### The Internet's Influence on Information Access
The introduction of the internet into government was initially met with security concerns, limiting access even for rudimentary tasks in agencies like the Treasury [00:11:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Despite potential misuses, the internet is considered one of humanity's greatest inventions due to its ability to provide vast information quickly [00:11:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This immediate access to information, now amplified by AI, enables both ministers and the public to quickly research topics that previously required public service advice [00:12:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, [00:12:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

## AI's Potential to Reshape Governance

The progression of AI from chatbots to more powerful agents capable of complex tasks over weeks or months suggests a future where systems might match or exceed human cognitive abilities [00:02:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Structural Questions for Government
One profound question raised by the potential for [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_and_its_possibilities | AGI]] is whether there will be a continued need for human ministers, judiciary, or members of parliament [00:16:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. While an executive head (like a Prime Minister) might still be human, the broader structure of human-led government could be challenged [00:17:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. This scenario would also entail a dramatic reduction in human public servants and defense forces [00:18:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

### The Role of Human Judgment and Morality
In a future dominated by advanced AI, the core responsibility of human leaders would shift from cognitive limitation—as AI could solve any problem—to matters of morality and ethics [00:21:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. AI agents, being rational and lacking human randomness, cannot be truly trusted with such decisions, as they cannot genuinely exhibit empathy or be moral beings [00:21:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. This highlights a deep problem for [[challenges_of_modern_society_and_governance | challenges of modern society and governance]] thinking about governance systems: how much license to give to super-smart, rational agents [00:22:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

### Impact on Policy Making and Political Dynamics
The increased speed of brief production using AI could put pressure on ministers to make faster decisions [00:16:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. However, this might lead politicians to be even more cautious, as more knowledge can sometimes reduce courage [00:22:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. Ministers still prefer human accountability in advice, desiring to "tell off" or explain why an elegant but impractical piece of advice is unsuitable [00:24:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. They do not want AI to tailor advice based on inferred thoughts, as politicians often keep their true intentions private [00:24:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

The core issue in policy development is not a lack of cognitive skills in the public service, but rather a political system that favors a "small target strategy." This strategy, combined with the belief that policies require an explicit pre-election mandate, results in a lack of substantial [[reforms_and_improvements_in_public_policy_and_governance | reforms and improvements in public policy and governance]] once in government [00:27:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

### Automation in Public Service
Technology has already dramatically reduced lower-band public service roles. In the 1980s, about 50% of the Australian Public Service (APS) was in the lowest two bands, compared to about 5% today, largely due to automation [00:29:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. The concern with human-level AI is its potential to automate away even higher-level cognitive roles, traditionally considered indispensable to human production functions [00:31:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. If AI can displace these roles, it challenges the historical trend where technology made humans more productive without displacing them [00:32:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.

## [[economic_implications_of_ai_and_agi | Economic Implications of AI and AGI]]

The potential for widespread displacement of knowledge workers by AI raises significant [[economic_implications_of_ai_and_agi | economic implications of AI and AGI]].

### Income and Consumption in an AI-Driven Economy
Historically, economic functioning has provided citizens with income to spend, supported by technological advances and capital deepening leading to real wage growth [00:35:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>. However, with human-level AI, there's a possibility that production processes may no longer be a secure source of income for most people [00:36:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>. This could lead to a shrinking pool of actively engaged producers and consumers, concentrating wealth among those who own AGI services [00:37:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

### Challenges for Taxation and Redistribution
Such a scenario poses a profound challenge for [[ai_applications_in_economic_policy_making | AI applications in economic policy making]], particularly concerning taxation and income redistribution [00:38:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>. Governments are already contemplating new forms of taxation to address a potential income tax base that becomes increasingly extraterritorial due to AI services provided globally [00:39:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.

## Policy Responses and Challenges

Policymakers must consider how to guide AI development to serve humanity rather than displace it [01:58:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:54">[01:58:54]</a>.

### Mitigating Unemployment and Promoting Productivity
The aim should be for new technologies to act as "labor assistance," improving the productivity of human labor rather than displacing it [01:59:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

### Importance of Human Systems
The concept of checks and balances in human form and the separation of powers becomes crucial in an AI-dominated future to prevent unchecked influence from super-smart agents [00:20:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. Decentralization of advice and shared human responsibility are also vital [00:20:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

### The Need for Political Courage and Vision
Australia's recent history shows a decline in major economic reforms, with the last major one being the consumption tax in 2000 [00:00:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This "lackluster reform" is attributed to political complacency, potentially fueled by the perception of prosperity from the mining boom [01:44:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:02">[01:44:02]</a>. There is also a perceived decline in the "personal ambition" of political leaders to pursue challenging, impactful reforms that build a legacy [01:45:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a>. Effective reform often requires leaders to "create a sense of urgency" or a "burning platform" to motivate action among a complacent public [02:01:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:45">[02:01:45]</a>.

The challenge for Australia is to create an environment conducive to technological innovation that can be commercialized domestically, fostering growth beyond traditional sectors like mining [01:36:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:58">[01:36:58]</a>. This requires political leaders to articulate a vision and narrative that brings the public along on a journey of necessary, sometimes difficult, changes [01:53:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:39">[01:53:39]</a>.

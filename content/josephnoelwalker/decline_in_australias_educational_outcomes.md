Australia faces an under-discussed policy problem: the long slide in high school math and literacy scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This decline in educational outcomes has been observed since mid-century for math and literacy scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, with PISA scores deteriorating since the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Explaining the Decline: Teacher Quality and Gender Discrimination

One surprising explanation for this decline, highlighted by Andrew Lee, a member of the federal Labor government and former ANU economics professor, relates to teacher quality and historical gender pay discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Historically, Australia had a method of attracting highly talented teachers, particularly throughout the 1960s and 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This was largely due to rampant gender pay discrimination across other professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### The Impact of Gender Pay Discrimination

Before the equal pay cases of 1969 and 1972, gender pay discrimination was legal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The consequence was that very few talented women pursued professions like law, medicine, or dentistry, leading to lower quality services in those fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Instead, overwhelmingly, these talented women entered teaching and nursing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This artificially increased the academic aptitude and caliber of individuals entering teaching in the 1950s and 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

However, throughout the 1970s and 1980s, gender pay gaps and discrimination in other sectors began to recede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. As talented women then flowed into these previously restricted fields, teaching wages did not keep pace to continue attracting the same level of academic talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. In fact, teaching wages slightly slipped behind those of other professional occupations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This trend is visible in the academic aptitude of new teachers from the early 1980s to the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Consequences of Declining Teacher Quality

This decline in teacher quality is correlated with Australia's deteriorating test scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Over the last couple of decades, Australian students have fallen behind by approximately half a year to a full year of achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. For instance, the typical Year 9 student now scores about where a typical Year 8 student would have scored at the start of the century on the OECD's PISA test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

The initial objective in developing RNA therapies was to create therapeutic protein-coding RNA that lacked inflammatory properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Initial Challenges with RNA Immunogenicity

A significant challenge was that RNA introduced from outside into immune cells tended to be inflammatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This was because RNA is not naturally supposed to exist outside the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Researchers initially expected that most forms of RNA would activate and generate an [[understanding_immune_response_to_rna | immune response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Even RNA naturally found within the human body can cause an inflammatory reaction if it comes out of the cell, for example, due to injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Investigating Cellular RNA

To understand the difference between synthetic RNA and RNA found inside cells, researchers proposed isolating RNA from human cells and comparing its [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | immunogenicity]] to in vitro-made RNA when introduced to human immune cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The primary goal was to understand if synthetically produced RNA differed from what was naturally found inside cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, not specifically to create non-immunogenic RNA, which they had no idea existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

The method involved isolating RNA from cells, creating RNA in a tube, applying both to cells, and observing if they elicited the same [[understanding_immune_response_to_rna | immune response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## The Discovery of Non-Immunogenic RNA

In an unexpected finding, Transfer RNA (tRNA) did not induce any [[understanding_immune_response_to_rna | immune response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This led to the hypothesis that the abundant [[nucleoside_modification_in_rna | modified nucleosides]] known to be present in tRNA might be responsible for its non-immunogenic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The next challenge was to determine how to prove this hypothesis and how to create RNA containing these [[nucleoside_modification_in_rna | nucleoside modifications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Research into RNA aimed to create therapeutic protein-coding RNA that was not inflammatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. A key question was why synthesized RNA might cause an [[mrna_and_its_inflammatory_response | inflammatory response]] compared to RNA naturally found inside a cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It was hypothesized that this inflammation occurred because external RNA, which is not typically found outside the cell, was being introduced to immune cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Initial Experiment and Unexpected Discovery

To investigate this, researchers decided to isolate RNA from human cells and compare its [[understanding_immune_response_to_external_rna | immune response]] when introduced to human dendritic cells, against the response generated by *in vitro* (synthetically) made RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. At the outset, the expectation was that all forms of RNA tested—whether cellular or synthetic—would activate and generate an [[understanding_immune_response_to_external_rna | immune response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. They did not anticipate finding any RNA that was non-immunogenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

However, during testing of various RNA types, including [[transfer_rna_and_immune_response | Transfer RNA]] (tRNA), ribosomal RNA, and different bacterial RNAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, a significant finding emerged: [[transfer_rna_and_immune_response | Transfer RNA]] did not induce any [[understanding_immune_response_to_external_rna | immune response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## The Role of Nucleoside Modifications

This led to the hypothesis that the non-immunogenic nature of [[transfer_rna_and_immune_response | Transfer RNA]] might be linked to its known characteristic of containing the most modified nucleosides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The next challenge immediately became how to prove this, specifically how to synthesize RNA containing nucleoside modifications to test this theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Research Motivation

It's important to note that the initial goal of this research was not to create non-immunogenic RNA, but rather to understand if synthetically produced RNA differed in its [[understanding_immune_response_to_external_rna | immune response]] from RNA found within a cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The existence of non-immunogenic RNA was not initially known or sought after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Overall, most RNAs, including those isolated from human cells, were found to induce an [[understanding_immune_response_to_external_rna | immune response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Even the body's own RNA, when released outside the cell due to injury, can provoke an [[understanding_immune_response_to_external_rna | inflammatory reaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

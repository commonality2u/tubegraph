Selfish gene theory, first popularized by Richard Dawkins, offers a gene-centered view of evolution, proposing that organisms are "survival machines robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This perspective has been described as one of the most disturbing discoveries in the history of science due to its implications for understanding seemingly altruistic behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Intellectual and Emotional Impact

Matt Ridley encountered selfish gene theory upon its publication in 1976, during his first term studying zoology at Oxford, where Richard Dawkins was part of the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The book "hit [him] like a thunderbolt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, revealing science as an unfinished masterpiece constantly grappling with mysteries, rather than just a catalog of known facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Randolph Nesse, in 1994, noted that the discovery that altruistic tendencies are shaped by benefits to genes was deeply unsettling, causing him sleepless nights as he sought alternatives that didn't challenge his sense of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Explaining Altruism

A key aspect of the gene-centered view is its ability to explain behaviors like parental care. Ridley highlights the seemingly "weird" fact that people go to "enormous lengths to do incredible kindnesses to their children" more than to strangers or other groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. From a gene-centered perspective, the answer is that "the people who are nice to their children had more children survive than people who are not nice to their children," indicating a genetic selection for such behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Connection to Innovation

Matt Ridley argues for a direct continuum between biological [[cultural_evolution_and_its_significance | evolution]] and [[the_interplay_between_innovation_trial_and_error_and_natural_selection | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Both processes, when viewed from a distance, involve the creation of "improbable order" from atoms and molecules using energy, making useful structures â€“ whether a jellyfish or a skyscraper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Just as in biological evolution, [[the_interplay_between_innovation_trial_and_error_and_natural_selection | innovation]] comes into existence through a process of [[the_interplay_between_innovation_trial_and_error_and_natural_selection | trial and error]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Ideas are "put out there" and then undergo a process of [[the_interplay_between_innovation_trial_and_error_and_natural_selection | natural selection]] where some survive and others don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. For example, Google Glass failed because nobody wanted it, while the iPhone succeeded because people did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This "survival of the fittest" principle also applies to technological designs, as seen in the evolution of airplane windows from square to rounded shapes after crashes revealed metal fatigue issues in corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Ridley's book, *The Evolution of Everything*, further develops this idea, presenting [[the_interplay_between_innovation_trial_and_error_and_natural_selection | innovation]] as a direct next step in [[cultural_evolution_and_its_significance | evolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

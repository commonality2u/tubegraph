Australia's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted its significant [[australias_state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | State capacity]], often outperforming other developed nations, particularly the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The nation reported its first COVID case on January 25, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. By March 30, 2020, the then-Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced the largest economic intervention in Australian history, a stimulus package amounting to a third of a trillion dollars, all within approximately two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Pandemic Outcomes

Compared to the United States:
*   Australia's employment-to-population ratio returned to pre-crisis levels within 12 months, while the U.S. took five years to show significant recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   By the time Australia reopened its international borders and lifted restrictions in 2022, it had about one-fifth the number of deaths per capita as the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Despite these successes, Australia's pandemic response featured contrasting outcomes, notably between its economic measures and vaccine procurement.

## Economic Response: Jobkeeper

The "Jobkeeper" program is lauded as one of the best economic responses globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. It successfully kept Australian employees tethered to their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. A key unsung hero behind Jobkeeper's success was "Single Touch Payroll" (STP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>.

### Single Touch Payroll (STP)
STP is an IT system, miraculously introduced just before the pandemic (phased in by July 1, 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>. It automatically transmits payroll data to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) in real-time whenever a firm processes a pay run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. This system, originally designed for compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>, enabled Jobkeeper by reducing the risk of fraud and ensuring high integrity in payment delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. The ATO adapted to existing business payroll software, rather than forcing businesses to conform to a new standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>. The ATO converted about a quarter of its staff to work on pandemic-related tasks, with public servants working long hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.

## Vaccine Procurement Strategy

In stark contrast to Jobkeeper, Australia's vaccine procurement strategy was described as one of the worst globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Initial Focus:** Australia "went all in" on two vaccines: the University of Queensland (UQ) vaccine and the AstraZeneca vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This was a poor strategy compared to countries like the U.S. (Operation Warp Speed), which sponsored up to eight vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Failed Bets:** The UQ vaccine ultimately failed, and the AstraZeneca vaccine proved less efficacious than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** For a couple of months in 2021, Australia had the worst vaccination rate among OECD nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Reasons for Vaccine Procurement Failure

The failure is attributed to several factors:
*   **Health Department's Role:** There's a strong perception that anything managed by the Health Department tends to be a "disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Exclusion of Economic Expertise:** Treasury officials, despite understanding risk management, were "in the room but not at the table" during vaccine discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. There was significant pushback against economists contributing to vaccine strategy, viewing it as solely a medical domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Category Error:** The Department of Health's advice was often treated as medical advice rather than public health advice, which should integrate economic principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Politicians like Scott Morrison deferred to health advice, even when it led to missteps like the "it's not a race" comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Health bureaucrats may not consider social welfare frameworks or negative externalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Lack of Viewpoint Diversity:** The medical regulatory complex (e.g., ATAGI) lacks sufficient viewpoint diversity, including mathematical literacy and economic training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Nick Coatsworth, former deputy chief medical officer, has also made this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Tinbergen Rule Violation:** The procurement strategy attempted to serve two goals with one instrument: obtaining vaccines and simultaneously acting as an industry policy by prioritizing local manufacturing by CSL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Failure to Buy Insurance:** A core economic failure was not diversifying vaccine bets to mitigate risk, essentially failing to buy "insurance" against development failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   **Penny-Pinching Mindset:** The Health Department, accustomed to penny-pinching in standard operations, struggled to adapt to a crisis where massive spending was warranted to avoid far greater economic and social costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. Senior leadership should have provided the "big picture" thinking required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

## Lessons for Future Crises and Pandemic Preparedness

Looking forward, Australia needs to consider several reforms:
*   **Medical Regulatory Complex Reform:** If a more transmissible and deadly pathogen emerges, decisions regarding vaccine trials (e.g., stage three trials) may need to be accelerated or bypassed, requiring a fundamental shift in the medical regulatory complex's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Changing the composition of bodies like ATAGI and potentially parliamentary acts to allow for rapid vaccine deployment might be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Public Consent:** The initial six weeks of Australia's response in 2020 were "flawless" due to public cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. However, the subsequent failures in 2021, particularly the protracted lockdowns due to the vaccine rollout bungle, eroded public trust and willingness to comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. Political polarization and media influence also threaten future social cohesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.
*   **Crisis Management Principles:**
    *   **Honesty and Transparency:** Be honest about what is known and unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. Avoid "noble lies" that erode credibility, such as misleading advice about masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.
    *   **Flexibility and Foresight:** Avoid fighting the "last war" by applying solutions from previous crises to inappropriate contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. For instance, the focus on direct cash payments (from 2008 financial crisis) was not fully appropriate for a supply-constrained pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.
    *   **Maintain Optionality:** Do not limit future choices. For example, buying a diverse portfolio of vaccines would have provided options for domestic use, foreign aid, or other strategic benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.
    *   **Be Willing to Spend:** In a crisis with massive welfare losses, don't be "penny wise, pound foolish." The economic costs of inaction far outweigh the costs of spending to mitigate market failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure for Preparedness:** Investing in "shovel-ready" projects, particularly environmentally friendly ones, can provide immediate economic stimulus during future recessions, avoiding the long lags seen in large-scale infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>.
*   **Unemployment Insurance Reform:** Australia's current unemployment insurance system, with a flat, indefinite payment unrelated to prior wages, is globally unique and inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>. It should be redesigned to provide a proportion of prior wage for a time-limited period, with generosity potentially linked to economic conditions, to be "recession ready" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Quarantine Facilities:** Australia should build dedicated quarantine facilities, rather than relying on hotels, which proved problematic during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:25">[01:49:25]</a>.
*   **Sovereign mRNA Manufacturing:** Developing domestic sovereign mRNA manufacturing capability is a crucial preparedness measure already underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:55">[01:49:55]</a>.

## Strengths and Weaknesses in State Capacity

Australia ranks highly in global indices of [[australias_state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | State capacity]], often between fourth and tenth, and even first on some measures of administrative effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>. Anecdotes supporting this include:
*   98% of Medicare claims processed electronically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.
*   95% of individual tax lodgments processed without human intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.
*   Efficient border processing (e.g., "Smart Gate" allowing quick airport exits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>.

### Factors Contributing to Australian State Capacity
*   **High Public Expectations:** Australians generally expect their administrative state to function like an "Apple product" – working seamlessly "out of the box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>. Failures lead to political accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>.
*   **Political Structure:** The legislative and executive branches are closely intertwined, allowing for lower "frictions" in passing laws and funding programs compared to systems like the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.
*   **Shared Stake in Public Services:** Australia's system, especially in healthcare (Medicare) and partially in education, encourages broad engagement across income levels, as even wealthy individuals use and depend on public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. This creates political pressure to maintain quality.
*   **Professional Public Service:** Public servants are generally socially minded and willing to go "above and beyond" in a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. They are also paid relatively well, contributing to quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.

### Areas for Improvement in Australian State Capacity
*   **Grift and Special Interests:** Australia has a "tremendous amount of grift" built into its society and economy, with political constituencies protecting rent-seeking behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:44">[01:46:44]</a>. This propagates problems like housing affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:10">[01:47:10]</a>.
*   **Policy-Making Apparatus:** The policy-making process is seen as "broken," with a refusal to acknowledge tradeoffs and a tendency to imply that all benefits can be achieved without costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:27">[01:40:27]</a>. This contrasts with earlier periods (e.g., Hawke-Keating, Howard) where leaders engaged in serious public conversations about necessary economic reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>.
*   **Over-reliance on Central Agencies:** There is a centralization of power towards Commonwealth central agencies like Treasury, Finance, and DPMC, acting as gatekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. While beneficial for weeding out "insane ideas" from other departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:37:59]</a>, it raises questions about accountability and efficiency.
*   **Fiscal Federalism:** The division of responsibilities and funding between the Commonwealth and states is problematic. The current GST distribution system is complex and leads to a "status quo bias" against major fiscal reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>. Devolving more revenue-raising power to states (e.g., broad-based GST with direct grants) and reducing federal control over state spending could improve accountability and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:49]</a>.
*   **Limited Democratic Experimentalism:** With only six states, the opportunities for "laboratories of democracy" and policy experimentation are limited compared to the US with 50 states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.
*   **Healthcare System Flexibility:** While having a universal safety net, the healthcare system could benefit from more choice and competition without losing fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:04">[01:24:04]</a>.
*   **Public Education:** The public education system is seen as needing significant improvement, potentially by incorporating more school choice and charter school models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.
*   **Local Governance:** While local councils manage local amenities like parks and parking, the fragmentation can lead to inefficiencies, and consolidation or clearer functional definitions for different levels of government (local, state, federal) should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>.
*   **Post-Pandemic Economic Management:** While the initial pandemic economic response was relatively "easy" due to political alignment with spending, subsequent management of inflation (e.g., raising interest rates, not subsidizing electricity bills) has been seen as a "disaster" due to misaligned political incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>.

Australia's voting system is distinctive among English-speaking democracies, featuring compulsory voting, [[preferential_voting_and_political_culture_in_australia | preferential voting]], and an independent electoral administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This unique structure and administration reflects a distinct political culture shaped by utilitarian, Benthamite ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Benthamite vs. Lockean Foundations

Political historian Judith Brett identifies Australia's political culture as "majoritarian and bureaucratic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the United States, which was founded under the influence of John Locke's ideas of social contract theory and natural rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

In the US, the idea that the people are the source of government authority led to arguments against compulsory voting, as it was seen as a logical impossibility for the government to compel the very act that grants it legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. John Hirst, an Australian historian, notably argued against compulsory voting from this Lockean perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

In contrast, Australia's political institutions were significantly influenced by Jeremy Bentham's brand of utilitarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Bentham focused on making existing parliamentary institutions operate more democratically and efficiently for the benefit of a greater number of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Crucially, Bentham saw rights as being *given* by government, rather than existing prior to it, which aligns with Australia being "set up by government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Direct Influences
Specific examples of Benthamite influence include:
*   **Henry Chapman**, who designed the secret ballot in Victoria, was influenced by Bentham <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Catherine Spence**, known for her ideas on proportional representation, was influenced by reading an article by John Stuart Mill, a prominent utilitarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Broader Political Culture
Beyond direct philosophical influence, the "Benthamite way of thinking" was "in the air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. The Chartist movement, a working-class political movement in Britain from the 1830s, also influenced Australian political reformers. Chartists advocated for manhood suffrage (voting rights for all adult men without property qualifications) and the secret ballot, demands partly influenced by Bentham's ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Many immigrants, particularly to Victoria, were influenced by Chartism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## Government as a Public Utility and Trust in Institutions

For approximately the first 100 years of [[Australias_historical_antinuclear_stance | Australian history]], the British government largely paid for the colonial governments, leading to low taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This fostered an attitude among Australians that government was something that "just gave you stuff" without significant cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. In contrast, the American experience with "taxation without representation" fueled their revolutionary spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

This historical context meant that Australians developed a greater trust in government as "potentially benevolent," rather than "potentially oppressive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The government's role in building essential infrastructure, such as railways, and assisting migration further reinforced this view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. As W.K. Hancock observed in the 1930s, Australians tended to view government as "a large public utility for the service of individual interests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Majoritarian and Bureaucratic Culture

Australia's political culture is characterized by its majoritarianism and bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Bureaucracy**: Bureaucracies are seen as inherently meritocratic and democratic, opposing a society where status is fixed by birthright or positions distributed through personal networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. They operate by impersonal rules, ideally administered impartially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
*   **Egalitarianism**: The [[historical_egalitarianism_in_australia | historical egalitarianism in Australia]] stems from factors like early labor shortages giving workers more power and the gold rushes diluting existing hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This egalitarianism, particularly in informal manners, meant people disliked pretension and wealth did not automatically command deference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. The bureaucratic state, with its need for redistribution to maintain an egalitarian society, naturally aligns with this culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

## Compulsory Voting

[[Preferential_voting_and_political_culture_in_australia | Compulsory voting]] in Australia is a direct outcome and reinforcement of its majoritarian and bureaucratic culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

Arguments for compulsory voting, as debated in the late 19th century, consistently centered on ensuring the government had the support of the majority of *all* voters, not just those who chose to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. Philosophical objections related to liberty, individual conscience, or freedom, commonly raised in the US, were "barely there" in Australian debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

Compulsory voting passed with remarkable ease in 1924, preceded by only about an hour of debate in the Senate and with only one person voting against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. The sole dissenter, a Labor man, opposed it on anti-conscription principles (referencing the bitter World War I debates), but ultimately voted with his caucus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

The shift to compulsory voting was largely pragmatic. The Labor party initially opposed it due to concerns about compromising ballot secrecy (requiring postal votes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. However, once compulsory *registration* was introduced in 1911, and voter rolls became permanent, compulsory voting became "inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. Bureaucrats, proud of their comprehensive electoral rolls, saw compulsory voting as maximizing the benefit of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>.

Compulsory voting ensures high turnout, which encourages parties to appeal to the "moderate middle" rather than focusing on highly emotive issues to mobilize specific bases, as is seen in countries with voluntary voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>. This is seen as a stabilizer in the political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>.

## Preferential Voting and Representation

[[Preferential_voting_and_political_culture_in_australia | Preferential voting]] is also considered an agent of Australia's majoritarian culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. The Barton government's original 1902 Electoral Act sought preferential voting for the House of Representatives and proportional representation for the Senate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. These systems were eventually adopted in 1918 (preferential for House) and 1948 (proportional for Senate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

The introduction of preferential voting was initially driven by pragmatic political reasons. In the early Commonwealth, with a three-way split between Free Traders, Protectionists, and the emerging Labor Party, preferential voting was seen as a way to strengthen the political center by allowing preferences to flow between allied liberal factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.

Today, preferential voting and proportional representation allow specific interest groups and minor parties (such as farmers' organizations, the DLP, One Nation, and the "Teals") to gain representation and exert political pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a>. This flexibility helps the political system accommodate Australia's increasing social and demographic complexity, ensuring that minority interests are represented and disgruntled groups "stay inside of the political system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>. This is particularly evident in the Senate, where no single party has controlled the upper house since the early 1980s, forcing governments to negotiate on legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

## Evolution and Future Considerations

The Benthamite influence, coupled with a history of low taxation and a benevolent view of government, led to the development of a unique political system in Australia. While trust in political institutions has seen decline in recent decades, often linked to increased inequality since the [[australias_economic_reform_era | neoliberalism era]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, the core elements of the electoral system are seen as stabilizers.

Proposed future improvements include:
*   **Fixed-term parliaments**: A four-year fixed term would give governments more time to implement legislation and reduce speculative politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:17">[01:22:17]</a>.
*   **Voting rights for permanent residents**: Australia has gone "backwards" by not allowing permanent residents to vote, despite their contributions through taxes. New Zealand offers this right, which could help integrate people committed to life in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>.
*   **In-person voting**: While pre-polling is convenient, the act of physically attending a polling place for voting is seen as a crucial "public act" that reinforces civic responsibility and a shared societal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:41">[01:18:41]</a>. Therefore, technologies like "voting from home" are viewed with skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>.

The bureaucratic and majoritarian culture, while having underpinned Australian political institutions, faces new challenges from issues like declining trust and the prevalence of misinformation. However, the foundational elements of the electoral system continue to adapt, providing mechanisms for broader representation and stability in an increasingly complex society.

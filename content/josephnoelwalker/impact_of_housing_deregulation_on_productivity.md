The concept of [[housing_deregulation | housing deregulation]] is posited to lead to significant [[productivity gains from urbanization | productivity gains]] by facilitating the movement of workers to areas where their output is higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This idea is grounded in the broader economic principle that relocating individuals from low-productivity environments to high-productivity environments dramatically increases their earnings and, by extension, their productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Understanding Productivity Gains Through Mobility

Historically, the primary economic benefit of [[relationship between immigration and housing | immigration]] stems from allowing individuals to move from places of low productivity to places of high productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For example, a low-skilled worker from Haiti or Mexico moving to a high-productivity environment in the United States experiences a dramatic increase in earnings due to higher productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This phenomenon can multiply an individual's productivity by a factor of 10 in as little as a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Such movements are transformative, benefitting not only the migrant but also global food supply and other services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Surveys even suggest that if people were freely allowed to move, massive global migration, potentially involving billions, would occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Similarly, within a country, there have traditionally been no legal limitations on movement, allowing individuals to relocate from low-wage, less productive areas to more advanced, higher-wage regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This internal migration was common in the United States, with both low- and high-skilled workers moving from places like the rural South to higher-wage areas like California from the 1940s to the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. People moved to achieve higher pay and a better life, driven by the increased productivity available in developed areas due to factors like technology, management, or more fertile land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Modern Challenges to Mobility

Despite significant productivity gaps between regions in the modern US, mobility has substantially decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Research by economists Ganong and Shoag indicates that while high-skilled individuals continue to move to high-productivity areas, lower-skilled workers are exhibiting a reverse trend, moving from high-wage places like San Francisco to lower-wage areas like Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

The key factor in this reversal is the exorbitant [[economic_impacts_of_zoning_and_land_use_regulations | housing prices]] in high-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. For lower-skilled workers, the percentage wage gains in these areas no longer outweigh the increased [[economic_impacts_of_zoning_and_land_use_regulations | housing costs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Workers prioritize their standard of living, which is influenced by wages minus the cost of living, with [[economic_impacts_of_zoning_and_land_use_regulations | housing costs]] being the largest differentiating factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This situation contributes to [[economic_and_social_consequences_of_unaffordable_housing | unaffordable housing]] in productive areas.

## The Role of Housing Deregulation in Restoring Productivity Gains

The argument for [[housing_deregulation | housing deregulation]] leading to productivity gains rests on several points:
*   **Persistent Productivity Gaps** There remain substantial differences in productivity across regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Historical Precedent** In earlier periods with "much lighter regulation," there was little difference in [[economic_impacts_of_zoning_and_land_use_regulations | housing costs]] between high- and low-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Restoring Mobility** If [[housing_deregulation | housing costs]] were to return to reasonable levels, it would restore the historical economic pattern of workers across all skill levels moving to places where their wages and, consequently, their productivity are higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

While the impact might not be as extreme as international [[relationship between immigration and housing | immigration]] (where wages can multiply tenfold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, the productivity differences between regions like the Bay Area and the rural South are significant enough to predict a substantial increase in mobility if [[housing_deregulation | housing costs]] in high-wage areas were more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

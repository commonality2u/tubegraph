Education plays a significant role in shaping economic inequality within a society. The relationship between educational attainment, quality, and technological advancement can either exacerbate or mitigate disparities in income and wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

## Education and Technology: A Race

Economic inequality can be understood as a "race between education and technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
*   **Technology's Impact** Technology tends to automate routine tasks, potentially displacing lower-skilled workers, while complementing non-routine, creative tasks, making higher-skilled workers more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Educational Gains** If educational gains outpace technological advancement, there is a sufficient supply of high-skilled workers to meet demand, which helps to mitigate wage disparities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Conversely, if the rate of educational attainment lags behind technological progress, the demand for high-skilled workers can outstrip supply, driving up their wages and increasing inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

Australia's delayed "education boom" (increase in educational quantity) meant that the computer revolution of the late 1990s and early 2000s did not increase Australian inequality as much as it did American inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

## Decline in Australia's Educational Outcomes

Despite increasing the *quantity* of education, Australia has faced challenges with its *quality* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.
*   **Deteriorating Scores** Since mid-century, Australia has performed poorly on math and literacy scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Since the early 2000s, PISA scores have also been deteriorating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. The typical Year 9 student today scores where a typical Year 8 student would have scored at the start of the century, representing a decline of half a year to a year of achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
*   **Impact of Gender Pay Discrimination** A significant factor in the decline of educational quality was the previous rampant gender pay discrimination across professions in the 1960s and 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. This discrimination channeled highly talented women into teaching and nursing due to limited opportunities in other fields like law, medicine, or dentistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>. When gender pay gaps reduced in the 1970s and 1980s, talented women flowed into these other professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. Teaching did not significantly increase wages to compete for this talent, leading to a decline in the academic aptitude of new teachers, which correlated with the drop in test scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

## Policy Considerations for Addressing Inequality Through Education

Policy makers can create more educational opportunities to address inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.
*   **Expanding Access** Increasing access to vocational training (TAFE) and university education is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. Tracking and encouraging first-in-family university students can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.
*   **Improving School Quality** Ensuring that every school, regardless of location, is a great school is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.
*   **Attracting and Retaining Teachers** To improve education quality, it's essential to:
    *   Appropriately remunerate teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:58">[01:12:58]</a>.
    *   Reduce paperwork burdens to allow teachers to focus on educating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>.
    *   Develop appropriate curricula that offer flexibility without excessive preparation requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>.
    Research indicates that high-quality teachers can significantly impact students' lifetime earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>.
*   **General Skills and Adaptability** Given the difficulty in forecasting future job markets, the best approach is to provide general skill sets and higher generalist education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>. This allows individuals to adapt and change careers as the labor market shifts over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:33">[01:08:33]</a>.

## AI and Education's Future Impact

Artificial intelligence (AI) presents both concerns and potential opportunities for inequality. While there are fears about job automation and the potential for a shift in the labor-capital ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>, some studies suggest AI could have an equalizing effect within industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. Randomized trials show that the biggest performance gains from AI use are often among lower-performing workers, unlike past technologies like computerization which increased inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. Making AI models accessible can further support this equalizing effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.

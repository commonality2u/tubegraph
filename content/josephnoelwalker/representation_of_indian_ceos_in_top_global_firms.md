The success of the Indian diaspora, particularly in securing top leadership roles in global firms, can be attributed to two main factors: the distinct nature of the Indian education system and the cultural learning derived from large Indian families and pluralistic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Impact of [[impact_of_indian_education_system_on_success | Indian Education System]]

Indian individuals in the diaspora are often elite and well-educated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This is largely due to the [[impact_of_indian_education_system_on_success | Indian education system]], which is specifically designed for selecting the "cream" of talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Historically, this system was developed to select English-educated individuals for civil services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Later, it evolved to select top engineers and doctors to fit into the socialist planning machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This continuous process of selecting top talent has significantly benefited American companies, Silicon Valley, and firms worldwide, as the selection process is already completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Influence of Large Indian Families and Cultural Navigation

The prominence of Indians in top global positions is also explained by the influence of large Indian families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Literature on the "bamboo ceiling" suggests that while Asian-Americans are well-represented in the middle and upper levels of law and tech firms, they are not as well-represented at the very top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. In contrast, Indians are almost over-represented when it comes to top jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Notable examples of Indian CEOs leading major global corporations include:
*   Sundar Pichai (Google/Alphabet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Indra Nooyi (formerly PepsiCo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   Parag Agrawal (formerly Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   Satya Nadella (Microsoft) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   The current Indian CEO of Starbucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>

This over-representation is linked to the cultural lessons learned from being part of a large Indian family and living in a pluralistic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. From a young age, individuals learn how to [[navigating_social_hierarchies_rooted_in_indian_culture | navigate a complex system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Large companies are inherently complex, featuring built-in hierarchies and cultural codes that need to be understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Indians are taught from a young age how to communicate appropriately with various individuals across different social standings, whether it's peers, a janitor, board members, bosses, clients, housekeepers, gardeners, or chauffeurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This clear understanding of social dynamics and appropriate communication styles in India is a cultural code learned without conscious effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, proving highly beneficial in managing large, complex corporate structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

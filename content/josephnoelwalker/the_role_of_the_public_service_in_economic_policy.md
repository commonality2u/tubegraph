The public service plays a crucial, though evolving, role in economic policy-making, acting as a source of expert advice and a key implementer of government initiatives. Historically, government departments like the Australian Treasury have been central to developing and executing significant economic reforms.

## Evolution of the Public Service in Australia

### The Treasury in the 1980s
When Ken Henry joined the Treasury in late 1984, the environment was vastly different from today. Typist pools were common, where individuals spent their entire working days typing documents and making duplicates for filing purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Academic work in the early 1980s often involved using punch cards, which were fed into computers with significantly less power than a modern mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. Output would take hours, and coding errors might only be fixable days later due to limited computer access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

### Impact of Software and Digital Tools
The introduction of early spreadsheets like Lotus 123 in the Treasury in 1984 was "mind-blowing," enabling complex economic models to be built from scratch in hours instead of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. The Australian Treasury was reportedly among the first users of Microsoft Excel in Australia, a tool that proved indispensable for developing models to assess changes to the indirect tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. Ken Henry asserts that without this capability, the consumption tax (GST) introduced in 2000 would not have been possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:04]</a>.

The internet, despite initial security restrictions preventing Treasury access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>, was recognized as one of humanity's greatest inventions due to its ability to provide immediate access to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

Over time, technological advancements significantly reduced the need for lower-band staff in the Australian Public Service (APS). In the 1980s, about 50% of the APS was in the lowest two bands (APS 1 and APS 2), which dropped to about 5% by today, largely due to automation of tasks like typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>.

## The Public Service and Policy-Making in the Age of AI

### Changing Dynamics with Ministers
The introduction of the internet and the rise of advanced AI systems could fundamentally alter the relationship between ministers and their departments. Ministers might increasingly look up information themselves, akin to a patient Googling symptoms before seeing a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. However, human policy advisors remain crucial because:
*   Ministers receive information in different forms (oral, graphic, not just text) and often want to understand how they can communicate the policy to a wider audience using the same "props or devices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.
*   Accountability is important and can only be delivered by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>. Ministers want to be able to "tell off" advisors and explain why advice might be elegant but unsellable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:20:00">[24:20:00]</a>.
*   Ministers do not want to be second-guessed or have advice tailored to what the AI thinks is in their head, as they wish to keep much of their political thinking private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:57:00">[24:57:00]</a>.

### AI and the Future of Governance
The potential for human-level AI (AGI) raises profound questions about the future of government. Some theorists suggest AGI could eliminate the need for judiciary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a> or even politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>. While AGI could solve cognitive problems before humans even think of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>, it lacks human dimensions like morality, ethics, and empathy, and cannot be trusted to act irrationally or randomly like humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>.

This leads to a deep problem for systems of governance: how much license to give to super-smart agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:00">[22:07:07]</a>. The principle of separation of powers in human form might be crucial to preserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>, ensuring checks and balances. Additionally, a decentralized approach to advice with multiple human perspectives is seen as vital, as a chief executive would likely want more than one source of advice and human colleagues with whom to share responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:00">[20:44:00]</a>.

The impact of AI on policy-making quality is uncertain. Increased knowledge from AI could make politicians *more* cautious, which might not be a good thing, as courage is often needed for difficult policy decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39:00">[22:39:00]</a>. The limiting factor in policy development is not a lack of cognitive ability in the public service, but rather the "small target strategy" adopted by political actors, where they offer minimal policy proposals to avoid scrutiny and only act on pre-election mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:07:00">[27:07:00]</a>.

On the question of job displacement, Ken Henry believes that public policy should aim to ensure new technologies act as "labor assistance" to improve productivity rather than displace human workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:54">[01:58:54]</a>. The historical record shows that technological advances and capital deepening have consistently enhanced human productivity and real wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:00">[32:26:00]</a>. However, with the rise of AI, there's a possibility that production processes may no longer offer a secure or even insecure form of income for many people, leading to a shrinking pool of workers in the production-consumption-savings space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:34:00">[36:34:00]</a>. This raises questions about how to tax highly profitable AGI services and redistribute income when the traditional income tax base is beyond reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:21:00">[38:21:00]</a>.

## Qualities of an Effective Senior Public Servant
To be an effective senior public servant, several qualities are indispensable:
*   **Trust**: Building and retaining trust is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:01">[02:13:01]</a>.
*   **Technical Expertise**: Leaders need to be technical experts to command trust, as their ability to provide immediate, informed answers in critical situations is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:16">[02:13:16]</a>.
*   **Collaboration**: Working effectively with colleagues across different government agencies is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:30">[02:14:30]</a>. The Treasury, historically known as "Dr. No" for rejecting spending proposals, shifted to a "Dr. Yes" persona, aiming to assist other departments in policy development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:21">[02:15:21]</a>.
*   **Team Leadership**: The ability to create and lead highly effective, motivated teams is essential, especially when unrealistic demands are placed upon them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:55">[02:15:55]</a>.
*   **Comfort with Ambiguity**: Public servants must be comfortable with ambiguity, as burnout can occur when this comfort is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:33">[02:16:33]</a>.

## Challenges in Policy Development and Implementation

### The End of the [[Australias Economic Reform Era | Economic Reform Era]]
The ambitious period of economic reform in Australia, from 1983 to 2000, has been followed by 25 years of comparatively lackluster reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:34">[01:38:34]</a>. This decline is attributed to several factors:
*   **Complacency**: A significant factor is complacency, linked to how Australia perceives its economic standing, particularly the "mining myth" that suggests mining underpins prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>. The long-term appreciation of Australia's terms of trade since late 2002 fostered a sense of comfort that reduced pressure for further reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:15">[01:44:15]</a>.
*   **Political Ambition and Courage**: Leaders like Paul Keating and John Howard were driven by a personal ambition to prove their leadership capabilities through significant reforms like the GST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:03">[01:45:03]</a>. Keating sought to demonstrate national leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:27">[01:45:27]</a>, while Howard, a "frustrated reformer" from the Fraser government, tackled the GST to prove his reformist credentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:16">[01:47:16]</a>. In contrast, some recent politicians have explicitly disavowed having a "legacy," which is seen as a "vanity project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:32">[01:49:32]</a>.
*   **"Burning Platform" Narrative**: Economic reform often requires a "burning platform" narrative to motivate action, scaring people into doing something different from what they are currently doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:06">[02:02:06]</a>. This was exemplified by Keating's "Banana Republic" statement in 1986, which spurred micro-reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:22">[02:01:22]</a>.
*   **Political Strategy**: The "small target strategy" combined with the expectation that policies must have a pre-election mandate to be implemented post-election, results in little substantive action once in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:7:27">[02:7:27]</a>.

### Key Policy Areas Requiring Reform
The public service continues to grapple with fundamental economic challenges:
*   **Tax Reform**: The Henry Review, published 15 years prior, made significant recommendations, including a flat 25% Nordic-style tax on capital income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>. Unfinished work remains on company income tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. A key area for reform is comprehensive road user charging, which would abolish fuel excise, motor vehicle registration, driver's license fees, and stamp duties on vehicles, replacing them with charges based on vehicle weight, distance traveled, location, and carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. The difficulty in implementing such reforms, even with broad support from affected groups, highlights persistent policy inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.
*   **Fiscal Policy and [[challenges_of_modern_tax_and_economic_policies | Intergenerational Equity]]**: Australia faces a fiscal problem, partly due to the disregard for principles set out in the Charter of Budget Honesty Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. A significant concern is [[role_of_policy_and_taxation_in_reducing_inequality | intergenerational equity]], particularly the impact of fiscal drag on personal income tax scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. Young people, experiencing real wage reductions but higher average tax rates due to fiscal drag, feel "robbed" compared to older generations who benefit from more favorably taxed capital income and housing affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. Indexing personal income tax scales is proposed as a starting point to address this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>.
*   **Population and Immigration**: Australia's current high population growth strategy, primarily through net migration, within existing major cities, has created second-order consequences like housing unaffordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:16">[01:02:16]</a>. A sustainable population requires creative policy design, including serious consideration of where people will live and how to support new cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>. The idea of building new cities (e.g., ten cities of one million people along a corridor, supported by high-speed rail) is presented as an alternative to urban concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>. The success of Port Macquarie, a service-based city driven by hospital construction, serves as an example of how strategic investment in services can attract population growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>.
*   **Productivity Growth**: Addressing stagnant productivity growth requires focusing on capital deepening (augmenting labor with capital assistance, including AI) and multi-factor productivity (finding new, smarter ways of doing things) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:16">[01:24:16]</a>. Australia has experienced "capital shallowing" in the last decade due to a collapse in the investment rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:03">[01:25:03]</a>. Attracting global capital requires offering compelling opportunities, such as in critical minerals processing or engineered wood products, despite existing challenges and mindsets that favor exporting least-processed raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:17">[01:28:17]</a>. Achieving 95% of the US productivity level is seen as a realistic aspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>.
*   **Vertical Fiscal Imbalance**: The allocation of Commonwealth-State roles and responsibilities, particularly on the expenditure side, needs review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:50">[02:04:50]</a>. Overlapping complexities, as highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic with blame-shifting over aged care deaths, are "deplorable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>. A "clearsighted" review of roles should lead to a mature conversation about tax base allocation between levels of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:17">[02:06:17]</a>, recognizing that some of the "worst" and most fragile taxes exist at the state level (e.g., stamp duties, insurance taxes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:13">[02:07:13]</a>.

In conclusion, the public service's role is complex and critical, navigating technological transformation, political realities, and persistent economic challenges. Its effectiveness hinges on its ability to provide trusted, expert advice, foster collaboration, lead effectively, and push for ambitious, forward-thinking policies, even in the face of political complacency or the absence of an immediate "burning platform."

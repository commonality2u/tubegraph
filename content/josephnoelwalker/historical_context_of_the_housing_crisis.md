For the majority of human history, essential goods were scarce and, consequently, expensive. This trend persisted until relatively recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## From Scarcity to Abundance

In 15th-century England, approximately 80% of personal spending was allocated to food, with 20% of that specifically on bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. However, since the Industrial Revolution, innovation has largely transformed the human story into one of increasing abundance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. The price of necessities, when measured by the hours of work required to purchase them (from bread to cars and televisions), has consistently fallen, often steeply, over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

## Housing: An Exception to the Trend

One particular durable good that has defied this pattern of progress is housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>. It has become a reality that the cost of residential structures, or more accurately the land beneath them, continues to rise, even as prices for household goods decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

Over the last quarter-century, Australia's house price-to-income ratio has approximately tripled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. According to the latest Demographia report, Sydney and Melbourne rank as the second and seventh least affordable cities globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This unaffordable [[housing affordability crisis in Australia | housing market]] means many Australians live far from productive jobs, shoulder enormous debts, or endure the precarity of renting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. It can delay family formation and contribute to urban sprawl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. The housing crisis is considered the "defining social policy disaster" of our times in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

## Emergence of Zoning Regulations

Peter Tulip, Chief Economist at the Centre for Independence Studies, notes that constricted housing supply is not unique to Australia but is also a problem in the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Ireland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. This phenomenon is common across the Anglosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. One contributing factor could be higher rates of immigration in English-speaking countries, leading to stronger pressures for increased housing supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

A common argument is that the English-speaking tradition of government and culture places a significant emphasis on local control, granting neighboring residents considerable say over what can be built on private property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

In Australia, the problem with zoning regulations began to emerge around the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. This era saw strong population growth in the 1960s and 1970s, combined with the rise of car ownership, enabling inexpensive car-based sprawl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. As commutes lengthened significantly (from one to two or even three hours), people started advocating for building "up" rather than "out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. As cities like Melbourne and Sydney grew to 3-4 and now 5 million people, vertical expansion became necessary, which is where zoning restrictions become more severe and harder to circumvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

There isn't one dramatic legislative change that explains this shift, as changes occurred at different times across various states and countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Instead, it's an "unfortunate combination" of factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to Rising Prices

### Demand Outstripping Supply
Over several generations, demand for housing has increased by approximately 3% per year, while supply has only increased by about 2% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. This persistent imbalance means prices continually rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

### Tax Concessions
The interaction of negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount (introduced in 1999) significantly favored property investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. However, the impact of these tax concessions on prices today is considered very small, contributing only between 1% and 4% to overall prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

### Global Interest Rates
A more significant explanation for the rapid increase in house prices globally, especially in English-speaking countries like Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand, beginning around the early 2000s, is the falling long-term interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. This factor is known to drive house prices up due to both empirical and theoretical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Australia's housing market was not unique in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

Since the early 2000s, prices have more than doubled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Tax concessions, contributing only a small percentage, cannot explain this widespread increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. While there are valid equity and fiscal policy reasons to revisit these tax provisions, it is not considered the primary driver of current housing affordability issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

## Long-Term Trends and Future Outlook

The [[housing_affordability_crisis_in_australia | housing crisis]] is a problem that "built up over generations," indicating that a quick resolution is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. Solving it will require a substantial increase in the construction industry's capacity, which is a complex process involving adjustments in training, immigration, accreditation, and wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. While other countries like Auckland have doubled their construction workforce, it takes time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

If current trends continue, Australia risks reaching the affordability levels seen in cities like San Francisco, Manhattan, or London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. In central neighborhoods of these cities, housing is often only affordable through inheritance or extreme wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This leads to severe consequences such as homelessness, social divisions, reduced [[housing_deregulation_and_productivity | productivity]] growth due to young and entrepreneurial people leaving, and increased inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

The expectation of substantial [[effects_of_housing_appreciation_on_wealth | home equity appreciation]] is deeply ingrained in Australian society, influencing how people plan for wealth building and retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. However, this is not considered a "normal and natural" phenomenon by some economists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. Regional towns in Australia demonstrate that people can have a "sensible culture" and accumulate wealth through other means, even without rapidly appreciating housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

While a majority of homeowners might oppose policies that reduce house prices, many also care about their children's future and the declining opportunities for younger generations to access housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This concern can create a political will for change, as parents may prefer their families to live nearby rather than in distant, more affordable areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

The "YIMBY" (Yes In My Backyard) movement, advocating for more housing supply, has grown significantly in recent years, becoming an influential grassroots movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Despite this, there is not yet full agreement among all stakeholders on the need for housing prices to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. Key figures in urban planning and architecture, unlike many economists, remain skeptical that market forces alone can improve [[housing_affordability_crisis_in_australia | affordability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.

## Contrasting Investment Approaches in the US and India

In the United States, there's a prevailing assumption that many public goods, such as clean water, sidewalks, basic law enforcement, and efforts to mitigate air pollution, are readily available and managed by the public sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This environment allows the private sector, particularly in the digital space, to focus on supplying other needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Conversely, in India, the private sector is often required to develop hardware solutions that are taken for granted in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This fundamental difference influences [[indian_versus_american_venture_capital_approaches | venture capital approaches]] in both regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## [[Venture Capital and risk management | Venture Capital Risk Assessment]]: Software vs. Hardware

Venture capitalists (VCs), particularly those influenced by the US model, tend to prioritize software investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This preference stems from the perception that software development carries virtually no [[market_risk_versus_product_risk | product risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Software solutions can be created by a few developers in a short period, making the primary concern [[market_risk_versus_product_risk | market risk]] (i.e., whether there's demand for the product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

However, VCs often misunderstand the risk profile for hardware solutions, such as air pollution devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. They assume that hardware involves both significant [[market_risk_versus_product_risk | product risk]] and [[market_risk_versus_product_risk | market risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. In reality, there is often very little [[market_risk_versus_product_risk | market risk]] for essential hardware solutions in places like India, given the clear societal need (e.g., for air pollution products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The actual challenge lies in the high [[market_risk_versus_product_risk | product risk]] associated with manufacturing physical goods, which VCs, typically focused on digital goods, are less equipped to evaluate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

This leads to a mismatch in investment focus, with VCs missing opportunities in hardware solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## The Role of Angels in India

This issue is not limited to American VCs; Indian VCs often mimic their American counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The main funders for hardware solutions in India are typically angel investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. These angels possess practical experience, having built similar things before, enabling them to de-risk product development and understand the nuances of hardware investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

In contrast, VCs predominantly focus on "product to market fit," a concept that while successful in other contexts, may not directly apply to India where the need for addressing [[Innovation and Technology Development | product risk]] in hardware is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. They tend to fund only ventures where there is perceived to be no real [[market_risk_versus_product_risk | product risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The concept of "interarrival time" is a crucial element in understanding and predicting rare, extreme events like major wars, particularly when dealing with [[fattailed_vs_thintailed_distributions_in_warfare_data | fat-tailed distributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. It refers to the waiting period between successive occurrences of events above a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Key Findings on War Interarrival Times

Research into historical warfare data, conducted by analyzing various accounts and estimates of war deaths, has revealed significant insights into the nature of major conflicts:

*   **Specific Threshold and Waiting Time**
    For wars with deaths exceeding a threshold of 10 million people, the waiting time (interarrival time) is observed to be "a bit over 100 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The last conflict of this scale was World War II, nearly 80 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Memoryless Property**
    A robust discovery is that the interarrival time for wars follows an exponential distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This means the process is "memoryless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. If, on average, a major war arrives every 100 years and one hasn't occurred in 100 years, it does not mean a new one is "coming"; the expectation remains the same, requiring one to "wait another 100 years" for the expectation to stay the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Challenging Assumptions about Violence Trends

The findings on interarrival time have significant implications for how we interpret historical data and assess current trends in global violence:

*   **Observed Absence vs. True Decline**
    Just because a major war (like one with over 10 million deaths) has not been observed recently does not allow for an inference that violence is in decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Statistical Grounds for Inference**
    To statistically claim that the distribution of major wars has changed, one would need to observe a period of approximately 300 years without a conflict on the scale of World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. As of 80 years post-World War II, there is "no statistical information" from this period to support such a claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Critique of Claims of Declining Violence**
    These [[statistical_perspectives_on_global_violence_trends | statistical perspectives]] challenge arguments, such as those made by Steven Pinker, that the world has inherently changed and violence has declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. While the data-generating processes *could* change, there is currently no statistical evidence to overturn the null hypothesis that they have not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Therefore, there are "no statistical grounds on which to say violence has declined" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

### The Role of Historical Data Exaggeration
Past studies have shown that [[the_role_of_exaggerated_historical_death_counts_in_war_studies | death counts were exaggerated]] by both conquerors and victims for various reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Conquerors exaggerated to appear more intimidating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, while victims, particularly in traditions like Christianity and Shi'a Islam, valorized victimhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. To account for these biases, research involved randomizing between high and low estimates for war deaths, such as for the Algerian War, to create multiple histories and ensure the robustness of the observed statistical properties, like the fat-tailed distribution (alpha parameter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. However, this aspect primarily relates to the *magnitude* of wars, rather than their interarrival times.

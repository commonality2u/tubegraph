Cells operate in a fundamentally different way from most human-designed objects, characterized by a dynamic and seemingly chaotic internal environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This unique nature of cells plays a crucial role in understanding phenomena such as [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## The Dynamic Cellular Environment

A cell can be envisioned as a "bag of molecules" that is constantly being shaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In this environment, nothing is guaranteed to remain in a particular place unless it is strongly bonded there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Cells function through the random bouncing of molecules, a process known as passive diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This stands in stark contrast to the precise and fixed designs common in human engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Resilience to Randomization

Most systems constructed by humans are incompatible with such a high degree of internal randomization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. However, cells are remarkably invariant to this kind of molecular disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. For example, during [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]], tissues like resected brain tissue are cooled to -130Â°C and below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This process effectively randomizes the molecular motion of all molecules within the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The ability of cells to be cryopreserved and rewarmed is considered incredibly strange given this randomization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

> "If you think about it, let's say that you took like a really complicated factory, right? And you stopped everyone in their tracks in the factory and then you spun them around and had them walk in a completely random direction and then have them like, you know, go back to their normal walking speed, but everyone was walking random directions. Like that's what cryopreservation is. It kind of just like randomizes the molecular motion of all the molecules after you go to like very low temperatures, which is super weird..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>

## Evolutionary Adaptation

This inherent resilience of cells is not accidental; it is a product of evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Cells evolved to function efficiently with very high amounts of [[thermal_noise_and_cellular_resilience | thermal noise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Consequently, they possess properties that make them highly invariant to the molecular randomization induced by [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The speaker suggests that a deeper understanding of cellular properties, particularly their reliance on passive diffusion and high [[thermal_noise_and_cellular_resilience | thermal noise]], is key to comprehending why [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]] is even possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

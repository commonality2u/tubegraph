In 2001, the Howard government implemented a series of regulatory changes to [[australian_immigration_policy_and_population_aging | Australian immigration policy]] that significantly increased the country's immigration intake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These changes brought intake levels back to those seen during the post-World War II "Populate and Perish" era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. At the time, this consequential decision went largely unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Background and Motivation

The Howard government aimed to increase [[impact_of_immigration_on_the_australian_economy_and_demography | immigration]] levels without compromising the skill level of migrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Facing a limited pool of highly skilled applicants, an innovative solution was devised: a massive expansion of the intake of [[role_of_international_students_in_australian_immigration | international students]] and [[role_of_international_students_in_australian_immigration | working holiday makers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The strategy was for these individuals to come to Australia, upskill, and then be given the opportunity to apply for permanent residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Abel Rizvi, who was Deputy Secretary of the Department of Immigration and managed Australia's migration program from 1995 to 2007, was deeply involved in these transformative changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. According to Rizvi, the primary motivation for these changes was demographic, accounting for about 80% of the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The goal was to [[australian_immigration_policy_and_population_aging | slow the rate of population aging]] over the next 50 to 100 years, making it easier for businesses and government agencies to adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Another contributing factor (around 10%) was pressure from universities, which needed ways to generate revenue and fund themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The expansion of the [[role_of_international_students_in_australian_immigration | international education]] program was seen as the best way to simultaneously increase the migration program, contribute skills, generate export income, [[australian_immigration_policy_and_population_aging | slow the rate of aging]], and provide a budget benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. These combined benefits made the proposal "too attractive for any government to refuse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

## Implementation

The Department of Immigration spent approximately 18 months preparing for the 2001 changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Key to this preparation was the groundwork laid by predecessors, particularly the introduction of the universal visa system and the electronic Travel Authority (ETA) in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. These systems allowed Australia, as an island nation, to maintain strict control over who entered and exited the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. The ETA system, for instance, integrated with airline reservation systems, automatically checking applicants against alerts and issuing visas seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

Despite the strategic merits, some ministers in the Howard government, including the Prime Minister, were initially reluctant due to previous policies that had significantly constrained the migration program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. There was also internal resistance within the public service and the department itself, with many feeling that the proposed changes risked "losing control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

> [!NOTE] State Capacity
> The ability of the Australian government to implement such complex changes, including integrating the Department of Immigration's systems with every airline in the world, highlights Australia's relatively high [[state_capability_and_policy_efficacy_in_australia | State capability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. This capacity was built over decades by a dedicated immigration department, which remained a standalone entity until 2015-2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:58">[01:18:58]</a>.

## Outcomes and Impacts

The 2001 policy changes proved successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. In the two decades following, over 2 million [[role_of_international_students_in_australian_immigration | international students]] and [[role_of_international_students_in_australian_immigration | working holiday makers]] came to Australia, with many settling permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. In recent years, [[role_of_international_students_in_australian_immigration | international students]] have constituted over 40% of Australia's annual net [[impact_of_immigration_on_the_australian_economy_and_demography | migration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The scale of this impact is such that [[australian_immigration_policy_and_population_aging | immigration policy]] in Australia is now largely driven by decisions regarding [[role_of_international_students_in_australian_immigration | international students]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

One significant and perhaps unforeseen benefit was the massive expansion of Australia's tertiary education sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Education rapidly became Australia's third-largest export, contributing to higher living standards for all Australians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. While the full extent of this growth was not anticipated, it was a positive outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>.

These changes are viewed as a "real stroke of Australian policy genius" due to their simultaneous achievement of multiple objectives: increasing skilled migration, boosting export income, and [[australian_immigration_policy_and_population_aging | slowing the rate of population aging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

## Legacy and Perception

Australia has become one of the most [[historical_egalitarianism_in_australia | Multicultural]] populations in the developed world, with about 30% of its residents born overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Despite high levels of [[impact_of_immigration_on_the_australian_economy_and_demography | immigration]], Australia generally maintains high rates of [[challenges_and_strategies_in_managing_migrant_integration | social cohesion]] and strong public support for [[historical_egalitarianism_in_australia | multiculturalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>. A key factor in this success has been the bipartisan political support for [[impact_of_immigration_on_the_australian_economy_and_demography | immigration]] and [[historical_egalitarianism_in_australia | multiculturalism]] since 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>.

However, Abel Rizvi suggests that if the 2001 [[australian_immigration_policy_and_population_aging | immigration policy]] had been put to a public vote today, it might not pass, largely because it was a regulatory change that "no one noticed" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>. The public's perception of government "control" over [[impact_of_immigration_on_the_australian_economy_and_demography | migration]] numbers is crucial for maintaining public confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. When net [[impact_of_immigration_on_the_australian_economy_and_demography | migration]] levels exceed forecasts, it can lead to public concerns about infrastructure capacity and service delivery, potentially fueling anti-[[impact_of_immigration_on_the_australian_economy_and_demography | migration]] sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.

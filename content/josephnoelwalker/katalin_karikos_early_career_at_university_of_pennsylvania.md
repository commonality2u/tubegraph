Katalin Karikó commenced her work at the [[university_of_pennsylvania_faculty_tenure_policies | University of Pennsylvania]] in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. She held a faculty position as a research assistant professor, which was a non-tenure track role, allowing her to establish her own laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Grant Applications and Research Challenges

From 1989, for the initial two years, Karikó wrote a grant every month in an effort to secure funding and establish her lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Despite these efforts, she did not receive any of the proposed grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, highlighting the [[challenges_in_acquiring_research_grants | challenges in acquiring research grants]].

Her research proposals focused on the use of circular RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This concept, now considered a new development, was already part of her grant applications and [[research_on_circular_rna_and_related_experiments | experiments]] as early as 1992-1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. She worked diligently to conduct [[research_on_circular_rna_and_related_experiments | experiments]] and generate data on circular RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Criticism and Adaptations

Karikó faced significant [[criticism_and_feedback_on_rna_research_proposals | criticism and feedback on RNA research proposals]] for her grant applications. Reviewers questioned the utility of labeled RNA and the sufficiency of her data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Occasionally, her knowledge in the field was also doubted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Rather than dismissing the feedback, Karikó maintained an open mind, believing that if her proposals were not understood, it was likely due to her own explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This perspective led her to improve her writing, seek feedback from colleagues, and conduct more [[research_on_circular_rna_and_related_experiments | experiments]] to bolster her proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Tenure Policy and Departure

The [[university_of_pennsylvania_faculty_tenure_policies | University of Pennsylvania]] had a rule stating that faculty members who failed to establish themselves and secure grant money within five years had to either be promoted or removed from their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Due to her inability to secure sufficient funding, Karikó was removed from the faculty in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

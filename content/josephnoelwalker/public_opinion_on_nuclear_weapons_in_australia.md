A 2022 poll conducted by [[low_institute_poll_on_nuclear_weapons_support_in_australia | The Low Institute]] revealed that approximately 36% of Australians either support or strongly support the United States acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This finding was unexpected by some observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Historical Context and Shifting Perceptions

Historically, Australia has had strong [[historical_perspective_on_antinuclear_sentiment_in_australia | anti-nuclear campaigns]], particularly prominent in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Due to this history, there was an expectation that popular opposition would intensify following the announcement of [[impact_of_aukus_on_australias_stance_towards_nuclear_power | AUKUS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. However, this anticipated [[reactions_to_australias_potential_nuclear_developments | popular reaction]] did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

The absence of significant public opposition to the idea of Australia birthing nuclear reactors suggested a more relaxed public attitude towards nuclear power than previously assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This apparent shift contributed to less surprise regarding the poll's outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Interpreting Poll Results

The interpretation of [[polling_methods_and_interpretation_in_nuclear_weapons_surveys | poll questions]] is a crucial factor in understanding [[public_opinion_on_australia_acquiring_nuclear_weapons | public opinion]]. Often, questions about topics like nuclear weapons are presented without [[polling_methods_and_interpretation_in_nuclear_weapons_surveys | counterfactuals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

> "When you ask Australians, do you want nuclear weapons? They're not asked, 'Do you want nuclear weapons if it costs this or if it means getting less of that?' They're just asked, 'Do you like nuclear weapons?'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>

Australia has been described as having a talent for bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This talent was tested during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the nation demonstrated a high-functioning administrative state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The first COVID case was reported on January 25, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, and by March 30, 2020, then-Treasurer Josh Frydenberg had announced the largest economic intervention in Australian history, amounting to a third of a trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

On almost any important measure, Australia outperformed the United States during the pandemic. For example, Australia's employment-to-population ratio returned to its pre-crisis level within 12 months, whereas the United States' had barely recovered five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. By the time Australia reopened its international borders and lifted restrictions in 2022, it had about one-tenth the number of deaths per capita compared to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Defining State Capacity

State capacity refers to the ability of governments at all levels to achieve their policy goals, essentially the "how" of governing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. A literature review on Australia's state capacity found that, despite public perception, Australia possesses one of the highest levels of state capacity in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This is further supported by international indices, which often place Australia between fourth and tenth globally, and fifth in Civil Service Effectiveness indexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>. Anecdotally, 98% of Medicare claims are processed electronically (1.1 million per day), and 95% of individual tax lodgments are processed without human intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.

### "Australia's Pandemic Exceptionalism"

The book "Australia's Pandemic Exceptionalism," co-authored by Richard Holden, Professor of Economics at UNSW, and Steven Hamilton, Professor of Economics at George Washington University, explores Australia's state capacity through the lens of the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Paradox in Pandemic Response

A central mystery of Australia's policy response to the pandemic is that the same National Cabinet and Public Service generated both one of the world's best economic responses and one of the worst vaccine procurement strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Success: JobKeeper

The JobKeeper program was a successful economic intervention that effectively kept Australian employees tethered to their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This was largely enabled by the "single touch payroll" system, which allowed the Australian Tax Office (ATO) to receive real-time information about worker pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>. The system, fully rolled out just six months before the pandemic, significantly reduced the risk of fraud, enabling the ATO to maintain high integrity in delivering JobKeeper payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.

### Failure: Vaccine Procurement

Australia's vaccine procurement strategy was notably poor. The government largely committed to only two vaccines, the UQ and AstraZeneca vaccines, rather than diversifying with a broader portfolio as seen in Operation Warp Speed's eight vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This proved problematic because the UQ vaccine failed in trials, and the AstraZeneca vaccine was found to be less efficacious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Consequently, for a couple of months in 2021, Australia had the worst vaccination rate among OECD nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

The failure in vaccine procurement is attributed to several factors:
*   **Health Department's Role:** Concerns were raised about the Health Department's handling of the procurement, with suggestions that decisions made within the department were often disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Lack of Economic Principles:** There was a "category error" where public health advice was treated as medical advice, rather than being subject to economic principles and cost-benefit analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. The mindset was geared towards "penny pinching," which was inappropriate for a crisis where costs blew out by orders of magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
*   **Failure to Buy Insurance:** The strategy lacked a fundamental understanding of risk management and the need to "buy insurance" by diversifying vaccine purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.
*   **Tinbergen Rule Violation:** Richard Holden suggests the procurement failed to heed the Tinbergen Rule, which states there should be one policy instrument per goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Instead, vaccine procurement was used to double as an industry policy, favoring vaccines that could be manufactured locally by CSL in Melbourne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Lack of Viewpoint Diversity:** The medical regulatory complex was criticized for lacking viewpoint diversity, primarily composed of medical professionals without sufficient economic or mathematical literacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:59">[01:19:59]</a>.

## Lessons for Crisis Management

For future crises, certain principles for statecraft and crisis management are highlighted:
*   **Honesty and Transparency:** Governments must be honest about what they know and don't know, avoiding "noble lies" to maintain public credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.
*   **Flexibility in Thinking:** Avoid fighting the last war by applying old solutions to new, distinct crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.
*   **Maintain Optionality:** Keep options open and avoid decisions that prematurely close off future possibilities, such as diversifying vaccine purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.
*   **Avoid Being Penny-Wise, Pound-Foolish:** In a crisis, the welfare loss of massive market failure is so significant that the government should not hesitate to spend money where needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

## Future Challenges to State Capacity

Concerns exist about Australia's ability to respond to a future pandemic, particularly regarding the public's willingness to comply with non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns. While the initial six weeks of the 2020 response were flawless, the subsequent failures, especially in vaccine rollout, led to public anger and a potential loss of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. The rise of media polarization could also undermine public consensus necessary for rapid, effective responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.

### Recommendations for Improvement

*   **Medical Regulatory Complex Reform:** Potentially "burn down" and rebuild the medical regulatory complex by changing the composition of advisory bodies like ATAGI to include diverse viewpoints, moving beyond solely medical experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Quarantine Facilities:** Build dedicated quarantine facilities to avoid relying on problematic hotel quarantine systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:25">[01:49:25]</a>.
*   **Sovereign mRNA Manufacturing:** Continue developing domestic mRNA vaccine manufacturing capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:55">[01:49:55]</a>.
*   **Recession-Ready Unemployment Insurance:** Redesign Australia's unemployment insurance system to be proportional to prior wages, time-limited, and automatically triggered by economic conditions, providing a living wage during recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>. This is distinct from the current flat-rate, indefinite system which is globally unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>.
*   **Shovel-Ready Infrastructure Projects:** Prepare a portfolio of "shovel-ready" infrastructure projects that can be immediately implemented during economic downturns, focusing on quick-impact initiatives rather than large, long-lagging projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>.
*   **Digital Currency Exploration:** Consider developing a central bank digital currency to gain advantages in global finance and facilitate new financial instruments, learning from China's aggressive rollout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>. This could position Australia at the forefront of the world's global financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>.
*   **Electronic GST Reporting:** Implement electronic reporting for Goods and Services Tax (GST) turnover, similar to Chile's system, to significantly reduce fraud and evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to Australia's State Capacity

Several factors contribute to Australia's relatively high state capacity:
*   **Public Expectation:** Australians have a strong expectation that their administrative state should function like an "Apple product" â€“ it's "meant to come out of the box and work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>. Failures lead to political accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>.
*   **Unified Legislature and Executive:** The Australian system, where the legislature and executive are closely linked, facilitates the passage of laws and funding programs with fewer frictions compared to systems like the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>.
*   **Universal Stake in Services:** Australia's hybrid healthcare system (Medicare) ensures that even wealthy individuals have a stake in its functionality, unlike the US where the affluent can opt out of public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.

## Areas of Weakness and Policy Erosion

Despite overall strong state capacity, Australia faces challenges:
*   **Grift and Special Interests:** A significant amount of "grift" has been built into the Australian society and economy, empowering political constituencies that make fundamental reforms difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:44">[01:46:44]</a>.
*   **Erosion of Policy Quality:** There is a perception that the quality of Australian policies has eroded over several decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:25">[01:37:25]</a>. This is partly due to a refusal by politicians to acknowledge tradeoffs, instead trying to convince the public that they can "have everything all the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:15">[01:38:15]</a>.
*   **Public Health Policy:** Australia has a poor track record of healthcare policy that restricts individual freedoms, as seen in the approach to vaping versus cigarettes, where the focus on nicotine addiction overshadowed potential benefits of harm reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.
*   **Commonwealth-State Relations:** While centralization of power within the Commonwealth is seen as beneficial, the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states is more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:18">[01:38:18]</a>. The current fiscal arrangements, particularly around the GST, create a strong status quo bias, hindering major fiscal policy reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:05">[01:44:05]</a>. Devolution of responsibility by eliminating specific grants to states and allowing them to manage their own revenue and spending could improve accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:57">[01:46:57]</a>.
*   **Education System:** The public education system in Australia, particularly at secondary and primary levels, is not universally seen as highly functioning or improving, suggesting a need for reform, potentially by injecting more choice and competition as seen in movements like school choice in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>.

## Learning from the US

While Australia generally outperforms the US in state capacity, areas where the US offers lessons include:
*   **Competition and Choice:** Introducing more competition and choice into Australia's more socialized systems could lead to better outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>. This is exemplified by the school choice movement in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>.
*   **Economic Incentives:** The US often features more powerful incentives and fewer barriers to private enterprise, which contributes to higher incomes and better outcomes in areas like housing affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:33">[01:48:33]</a>.

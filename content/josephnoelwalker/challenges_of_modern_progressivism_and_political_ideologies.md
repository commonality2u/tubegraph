## The Current Unhinged State

The current societal moment is described as unhinged, with people unable to have conversations and governments failing to mount effective responses, exacerbated by geopolitical rivalries during a global pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This situation feels "apocalyptic" because of the visible fraying of societal threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

> [!warning] Amplified Mistakes
> The West, amplified by the Enlightenment's advancements in science and technology, has made mistakes at an amplified level. This does not mean the West is inherently worse, but its errors have far-reaching consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. For example, while slavery was not invented by the West, its impact was amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>.

### Societal Dysfunction
The current state is characterized by a lack of clarity and competence, turning critical issues into political footballs rather than scientific crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. There's a prevailing sense that society is "out of shape" to deal with social unrest and potential revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This has led to the question of whether the US is a failed state, a notion that would have been ridiculed decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>.

### Technological Dependence and Adaptation
Society is leaning heavily on technology, which enables functions like virtual funerals, fundamentally reshaping human communication and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This rapid technological shift highlights a species struggling to adapt to new forms of communication, such as the awkwardness of eye contact during video calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Impact on Personal Worldview
The events of 2020 have significantly shifted personal priors, making one feel less "crazy" for holding seemingly unusual views, as the external world now reflects long-held concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. The gap between intellectual belief and visceral understanding of looming crises (like the "sword of Damocles" hanging over society) has closed, making the threats more real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## Challenges of Modern Progressivism and Political Ideologies

### Policy Responses and Ideological Divides
The COVID-19 pandemic response has been treated as a "political football" rather than a scientific crisis, with political ideologies often perfectly mapping onto policy preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This leads to a struggle with fundamental questions, such as whether "the loss of even one life is one life too many" versus considering trade-offs and quality of life against economic damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Arnold Kling's "Three Political Languages"
Arnold Kling's framework helps understand political ideologies by reducing them to core concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>:
*   **Libertarianism:** Most focused on resisting coercion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.
*   **Progressivism:** Cannot stand oppression, often willing to coerce for a perceived public good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.
*   **Conservatism:** Concerned about the loss of tradition and historical gains, wary of dismantling established knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.

Individuals often possess traits from all three, but an imbalance can lead to extreme views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. The inability to understand all three traditions, or to "graduate from the political spectrum," leads to absurdities where views on one issue can predict views on all others, creating tribal beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:06">[00:41:06]</a>.

### Critique of Modern Progressivism
Modern progressivism often struggles with "pathological egalitarianism," which seeks equality as an outcome and can be incredibly dangerous, even requiring violence to enforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. True progressives should prioritize markets, which lift people out of poverty and grant agency, while many who claim the label today are driven by jealousy and authoritarian tendencies, actually hindering progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:01">[02:08:01]</a>.

Modern progressive discourse often involves "anti-whiteness" rhetoric, which is seen as deeply racist, attributing positive traits like punctuality and scientific reasoning to "whiteness" and ignoring contributions from diverse communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

> [!example] Language and Pronouns
> While acknowledging the need for more inclusive language (e.g., addressing gender inflection in pronouns), the current approach of "choose your own pronouns" is viewed as a "bad technical solution" that communicates stupidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. A more constructive approach would involve linguistic study and collaboration, rather than authoritarian imposition that aims to make others "go through a fit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:32">[01:19:32]</a>.

### Black Lives Matter Movement
The Black Lives Matter movement has legitimate concerns, such as the differential application of policing and sentencing, particularly the high incarceration rates of black men for non-violent offenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:07">[01:24:07]</a>. However, the movement also includes "dumb stuff" like demands for white people to give away their houses, anti-Semitism, and calls to "abolish the police," which are seen as misguided and counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:16">[01:25:16]</a>.

> [!quote] The Monopoly on Violence
> The concept of a state having a "monopoly on violence" is an innovation that prevents warring factions and chaos. Calls to "abolish the police" disregard this fundamental societal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>.

This fusion of reasonable and unreasonable demands is problematic, often using a "motte and bailey" technique where a defensible core idea (e.g., stopping racial brutality) is used to smuggle in controversial or harmful agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. This approach is seen as intellectually overwhelming and "anti-intellectual," as it advocates "dumb stuff" that hinders genuine progress in reforming the criminal justice system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:11">[01:28:11]</a>.

## Decline of Institutions and Trust

There is a widespread sense that "every institution is lying" about most public discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:03">[02:02:03]</a>. This decline in trust has led to independent long-form podcasting becoming a "bright spot" where individuals can speak more truthfully outside of institutional pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:31">[02:22:31]</a>. The constant demand for "transparency and inclusion" in the internet era has paradoxically led to a "giant world of chaos" where adult, rational decision-making is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:30">[02:29:30]</a>.

### Kleptocracy and Economic Stagnation
A major cause of current derangement is the shift from encouraging innovation and growth to a focus on "thieving" from others, as the economic "pie" has stopped growing significantly since the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>. This has led to a "central kleptocracy" where both political parties are "robbing the family business blind" because they don't believe in its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

### "Kayfabe" and Fakery
This societal decay is exemplified by "kayfabe" – a term from professional wrestling referring to staged reality – where much of public life, including politics and business, is characterized by fakery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Many businesses are seen as having a "fake aspect," and societal members are "faking everything" because the effort to believe in reality is too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:50">[02:18:50]</a>.

### Generational Indifference
The "silent generation" and "boomers" are seen as the first generations not to automatically experience improving conditions due to growth and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. This led them to "rejigger the system" and "steal from slices of pie that were not theirs," exhibiting a "society-wide complete indifference for their own children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>. Examples include the rise of "sugar baby university," where students resort to "sugaring" to pay tuition, enabled by policies like Joe Biden's 2005 vote making student debt non-dischargeable in bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

## The Problem of Conformity

The [[Ash conformity experiment | Ash conformity experiment]] highlights how individuals tend to conform to group perceptions, even when defying their own senses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. This occurs due to "informational conformity" (taking a shortcut based on group consensus) or "reputational conformity" (falsifying preferences to avoid standing out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>. In modern discourse, this translates to an inability to have nuanced conversations, where any declarative statement can be immediately attacked with bad-faith interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>.

### The Ideological Turing Test
The [[Ideological Turing Test | Ideological Turing Test]], proposed by Brian Kaplan, suggests that true understanding involves the ability to articulate an ideological opponent's position convincingly, without slipping in contempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>. Passing this test helps "the illusion to evaporate," making it easier to be a non-conformist by seeing the political tribes from an anthropological distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>. However, post-modernism sometimes overstates the impossibility of objective observation, claiming all perspectives are culturally biased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.

## A Path Forward: Finding New Orchards and Agency

The stagnation of productivity growth since the 1970s is seen as abnormal, with the period from 1920-1970 being a "miraculous run" due to "umwelt hacking" – the expansion of human perception through instruments like telescopes, microscopes, and high-speed photography, leading to breakthroughs like the germ theory of disease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:48">[01:34:48]</a>. This era of readily available "low-hanging fruit" from expanding perception has largely ended, with new discoveries often lacking immediate industrial application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:49">[01:40:49]</a>.

The challenge now is to discover "the next orchard" for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:16">[01:42:16]</a>. This is primarily the job of governments, which possess the vast resources needed for such exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:53">[02:02:53]</a>.

> [!warning] Billionaire Underperformance
> Current billionaires are seen as "radically underperforming" in driving fundamental original work. Despite some exceptions like Elon Musk, many are criticized for not funding new institutes or original research, failing to leverage their wealth for truly transformative endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:36">[02:03:36]</a>.

### The Need for Uncorrelated Experiments
Humanity cannot afford to run "one correlated experiment" on Earth, as demonstrated by the global impact of COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>. Global interconnectedness means existential risks (viruses, nuclear accidents, climate feedback loops) can propagate throughout the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:48">[01:46:48]</a>. Therefore, there's a vital need to diversify by colonizing other planets and even star systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:08">[01:45:08]</a>. This requires breaking the [[Limits to technological and scientific progress | Einsteinian speed limit]], which currently traps humanity on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:19">[01:49:19]</a>. Physicists, who gave humanity the "twin nuclei" (the power of the atom and the cell) and thus "signed our death warrant," are also the ones who must find a way to escape this "prison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:56">[01:55:56]</a>.

### Hope in Individuals
Despite current societal problems, hope lies in "remarkable individuals" – "freaks and weirdos" – who can emerge from the current vacuum of leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:39">[02:06:39]</a>. This perspective emphasizes [[Human agency and its importance | human agency]] and the importance of outliers in driving progress, rather than collective action or communal efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:45">[02:11:45]</a>. The current state of "terrible" art and music is seen as a positive sign, indicating that something amazing could happen next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:57">[02:06:57]</a>.

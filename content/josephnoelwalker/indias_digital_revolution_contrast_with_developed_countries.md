India's digital revolution has unfolded in an "upside-down" manner compared to the developed world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Contrasting Development Paths

In developed nations, the digital revolution occurred after societies had achieved a certain GDP per capita, allowing widespread affordability of phones and the infrastructure necessary for the internet, such as fiber optic cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

Conversely, in India, excellent internet access can be found even in the poorest regions like Uttar Pradesh, Varanasi, and Bihar, while basic [[public_goods_in_the_us_versus_india | public goods]] like water may still be lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Overestimating the Digital Market

A common misconception in the tech sector, particularly for Western VCs, is the overestimation of India's digital market size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Figures suggesting 860 million people are digitally connected via smartphones, with at least one per household, lead to projected market sizes, such as 300 million for an edtech company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This represents an enormous overestimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The reality reveals a significant [[discrepancy_between_digital_access_and_disposable_income_in_india | discrepancy between digital access and disposable income in India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Only about 25 to 30 million people in India possess the same level of internet access and disposable income comparable to users in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This segment comprises individuals who subscribe to services like Netflix and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## The True Addressable Market for Western VCs

According to Sajit Pai's "Indus Valley Report," the segment of Indian internet users who actively spend money online is estimated to be around 200 million, possibly even less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The "next billion" users do not spend significantly on these digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Western VCs often look to replicate successful models like DoorDash or Uber in India, assuming a direct translation of the market given India's large smartphone user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. However, the total addressable market is actually much smaller than commonly perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Investors are essentially investing in a segment of India referred to as "the Taiwan that lives in India," which is both smaller and poorer than California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This [[impact_of_misconceptions_on_investments_in_indian_tech_sector | misconception about market size]] is a key area where VCs often err <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

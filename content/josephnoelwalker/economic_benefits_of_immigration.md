The primary economic advantage of [[the_relationship_between_immigration_housing_and_economic_growth | immigration]] stems from significant productivity gains [00:00:12]. Most people globally reside in countries with low productivity, while others live in highly productive nations [00:00:16]. Evidence from [[impact_of_immigration_on_the_australian_economy_and_demography | immigration]] demonstrates that the issue is not with the people themselves, but with the environments in which they operate [00:00:23].

## Productivity Transformation Through Mobility

When a low-skilled worker from a low-productivity environment, such as a shoe shiner from Haiti, moves to a high-productivity area like Miami, or a low-skilled Mexican farm worker moves to an [[immigration_challenges_to_america | American]] farm, their earnings can skyrocket overnight [00:00:29]. Basic economics dictates that this earning surge is due to a substantial increase in their productivity [00:00:49].

For a farm worker, the productivity increase is evident: they grow significantly more food on a modern, mechanized farm than on a primitive one [00:00:53]. For a service provider like a shoe shiner, productivity increases because they save customers more valuable time in a high-productivity environment [00:01:10].

This core economic argument for [[impact_of_immigration_on_the_australian_economy_and_demography | immigration]] highlights that restrictions prevent workers from naturally moving from low-productivity areas to high-productivity ones [00:01:21]. Such movement can be transformative, potentially multiplying someone's productivity by a factor of 10 in a week [00:01:35]. This perspective, while perhaps less common, emphasizes that enabling workers to produce more food for humanity, for instance, benefits not only the migrant but everyone who consumes [00:02:03].

The wage gaps between countries are often so dramatic that if people were permitted to move freely, massive migration would occur, with surveys suggesting potentially billions would move [00:02:18].

## Interplay with Housing Deregulation

Within a country, there are typically no legal limitations on movement [00:02:42]. Historically, it was common for people in the [[regional_economic_mobility_in_america | United States]] to relocate from low-wage, "backwards" areas, such as rural Mississippi, to advanced, higher-wage regions like the Bay Area or California, seeking better opportunities [00:02:44]. This internal migration saw both low and high-skilled workers moving from places like the [[regional_economic_mobility_in_america | US]] South to higher-wage areas [00:03:16]. The "Grapes of Wrath" narrative, while popular, often overlooks the positive outcomes for most who moved to California, securing higher-paid jobs and improving their lives [00:03:34].

The economic driver for this internal movement is the higher pay workers receive due to increased productivity in the destination area [00:03:53]. This higher productivity can stem from technological advancements, better management, or superior agricultural land [00:04:06].

However, the modern [[regional_economic_mobility_in_america | US]] exhibits a peculiar trend: despite persistent large gaps in productivity between regions, internal mobility has significantly declined [00:04:27]. Research by economists Shaganong and Shog found that while high-skilled individuals still move to high-productivity areas, lower-skilled workers are increasingly moving in reverseâ€”leaving high-wage cities like San Francisco for lower-wage places in Texas [00:04:41].

This counterintuitive movement is attributed to the exorbitant housing prices in high-productivity areas [00:05:14]. These costs are so substantial that for lower-skilled workers, the percentage wage gains no longer outweigh the additional housing expenses [00:05:25]. Workers prioritize their standard of living, which considers wages minus the cost of living, with housing being the dominant factor [00:05:35].

Restoring housing costs to reasonable levels, similar to periods of lighter regulation when housing costs did not differ significantly between high and low-productivity areas, would likely re-establish the traditional pattern of workers of all skill levels moving to areas where their wages are higher [00:05:57]. While not as extreme as the 10x wage multipliers seen with international [[role_of_international_students_in_australian_immigration | immigration]], the productivity differences between regions like the Bay Area and the rural South are still substantial enough to suggest significant mobility if housing costs were not a barrier [00:06:19].

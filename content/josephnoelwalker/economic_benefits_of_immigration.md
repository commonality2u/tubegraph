The primary economic benefit of [[relationship_between_immigration_and_housing | immigration]] stems from the movement of individuals from low-productivity regions to high-productivity regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The issue is not the people themselves, but the environment in which they work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Productivity Gains Through Mobility

When individuals relocate from areas of low productivity to areas of high productivity, their earnings can skyrocket, indicating a significant increase in their output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Examples illustrating this principle include:
*   A low-skilled worker, such as a shoe shiner from Haiti, moving to Miami sees their productivity increase because they are saving customers more valuable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   A low-skilled Mexican farmworker moving to an American farm becomes much more productive due to modern, mechanized farming methods, leading to substantially greater food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

This movement can be so transformative that a person's productivity can multiply by a factor of 10 in as little as a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Overcoming Immigration Restrictions

The core economic argument for [[relationship_between_immigration_and_housing | immigration]] is that restrictions prevent workers from naturally relocating to where their productivity would be highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Allowing workers to move to more productive environments not only benefits the migrants but also society at large. For instance, "illiterate workers on our Farms" from other countries produce significantly more food for humanity, benefiting everyone who eats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

The wage gaps between countries are often so substantial that surveys suggest billions of people would move if permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. For example, if Haitians were legally allowed to move to the US, Haiti would likely "almost empty" due to the dramatic difference in living standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Parallels with Domestic Migration and Housing Costs

Traditionally, within countries like the United States, there were no legal limitations on movement, allowing individuals from low-wage, "backwards" areas (like rural Mississippi) to move to higher-wage, advanced areas (like the Bay Area or California) for better opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This historical [[historical_migration_trends_in_the_us | migration]] was common for both low- and high-skilled workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

However, recent studies by economists such as Shaganong and Shog reveal a change in modern US [[housing_costs_and_migration_patterns | migration patterns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. While high-skilled individuals still move from low- to high-productivity areas, low-skilled workers are moving in reverse, leaving places like San Francisco where wages are higher for areas in Texas where wages are lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This counter-intuitive trend is attributed to "enormous" [[housing_costs_and_migration_patterns | housing prices]] in high-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The percentage wage gains in these areas no longer outweigh the additional [[housing_costs and migration patterns | housing costs]] for lower-skilled workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

If [[housing_costs_and_migration_patterns | housing costs]] in high-wage areas could be made reasonable again, it would likely restore the tendency for workers of all skill levels to move to places where their wages and, consequently, their productivity are higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. While the impact of domestic mobility may not be as extreme as international [[relationship_between_immigration_and_housing | immigration]], where wages can multiply tenfold, significant productivity differences still exist between regions like the Bay Area and the rural South, suggesting substantial economic gains from increased mobility if [[housing_costs_and_migration_patterns | housing costs]] were not a barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

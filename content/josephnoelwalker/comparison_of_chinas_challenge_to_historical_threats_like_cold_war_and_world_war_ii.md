The challenge posed by China's rise as a great power is often compared to historical threats faced by the United States, such as the Cold War and World War II, but with significant distinctions in scale and national response.

## Economic Scale of the Challenge

China's economic power presents a larger challenge than previous adversaries. No other power or group of powers has ever approached 60% of American GDP, a figure that China has surpassed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Economically, China already poses a bigger challenge than Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. In most respects, this makes it a much bigger challenge than the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This scale necessitates a "whole of nation" effort, which would be even "bigger than the Cold War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## National Mission and Effort

Despite the magnitude of the [[us_china_economic_and_military_power_dynamics | challenge]], no American president since China's rise has declared it a national mission, stating that the entire country should be devoted to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Such a monumental "whole of nation" effort, rather than just a "whole of government" or "Beltway project," would require public declaration from the president to motivate the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The absence of such a call suggests a current lack of a unified [[americas_national_mission_regarding_chinas_rise | American national mission regarding China's rise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Intellectual and Popular Engagement

The intellectual and popular cultural environment in the U.S. does not currently indicate that the nation is prepared for a contest of this magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. There is a [[lack_of_intellectual_and_popular_cultural_engagement_with_chinas_challenge | lack of intellectual and popular cultural engagement with China's challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

*   **Contrast with the Cold War**: Unlike the Cold War, which saw the development of "Cold War liberalism" as an entire school of thought, the current intellectual landscape concerning China does not resemble it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. While foreign policy establishments and academic scholars are actively writing about the "China Challenge," this discussion largely remains within the "Beltway crowd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Prominent public intellectuals and popular commentators do not demonstrate widespread "obsession" with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This points to a gap in the [[role_of_american_intellectuals_and_media_in_addressing_the_china_challenge | role of American intellectuals and media in addressing the China challenge]].
*   **Contrast with the War on Terrorism**: The current situation also does not compare to the War on Terrorism, where a wide range of public figures and media outlets were deeply engaged with questions of maintaining liberal democracy against radical threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Implication for Preparedness**: The absence of broad intellectual ferment and popular engagement suggests that the United States is not primed to support the scale of the challenge that its governing class claims to be undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This impacts the overall [[assessment_of_americas_preparedness_for_a_contest_with_china | assessment of America's preparedness for a contest with China]].

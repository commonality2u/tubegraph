[[Australian egalitarianism and its historical context | Australia's egalitarianism]] is identified as a long-running and intertwined cultural strand that quietly operates in the background to make the state effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34">[19:34]</a>.

## Early Colonial Conditions

One historical explanation for [[Australian egalitarianism and its historical context | Australia's egalitarian culture]] points to the early days of the colony, where labor was scarce and land was plentiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41">[20:41]</a>. This imbalance meant that workers had a more even balance of power with capitalists compared to Europe or North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47">[20:47]</a>. This scarcity of workers meant employers could not mistreat them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08">[22:08]</a>. As a result, early trade unions formed, and the 8-hour day emerged in the 1800s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13">[22:13]</a>. Workers in Sydney earned significantly more than their counterparts in Chicago and London due to labor scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21">[22:21]</a>.

## The Gold Rushes

The gold rushes in the mid-1800s played a significant role in shaping [[Australian egalitarianism and its historical context | Australia's egalitarian culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33">[22:33]</a>. This period saw wealth determined by luck rather than skills or existing hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:40">[22:40]</a>. The gold rushes attracted massive immigration, tripling Australia's population within a decade and increasing Melbourne's population sevenfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:11">[24:11]</a>. This influx created social fluidity and mixing, preventing the entrenchment of hierarchies seen in older societies like Venice or aristocratic French families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00">[23:00]</a>. The historian Keith Hancock noted that within a decade of the gold rush, the entire Chartist program had been implemented in Australia, supporting the idea of its rapid impact on society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:57">[23:57]</a>.

## [[Benthamite influence on Australian political institutions | Benthamite Influence]]

Another contributing factor to [[Australian egalitarianism and its historical context | Australian egalitarianism]] was the intellectual climate during the formation of Australia's political institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10">[21:10]</a>. While America's institutions were influenced by John Locke, Australia's were set up when [[Benthamite influence on Australian political institutions | Jeremy Bentham's]] utilitarianism was prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16">[21:16]</a>. This meant a greater emphasis on utilitarian principles rather than Gladstonian liberalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24">[21:24]</a>.

## Benign View of Government

Australians also developed a deep faith in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42">[19:42]</a>. This perspective was shaped by the colonial era's unusual relationship with the British government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11">[25:11]</a>. For about the first 100 years, the British government largely paid for Australia's governments, resulting in low taxation for colonists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:43">[25:43]</a>. Unlike America, which faced "taxation without representation," Australians viewed government as a entity that provided services without significant direct cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:53">[25:53]</a>.

The government played a crucial role in building the colony's infrastructure, such as railways and ports, which were developed by governments in Australia, unlike the private enterprise model in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:28">[27:28]</a>. Funds were raised through the sale of Indigenous people's land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39">[27:39]</a>. This provision of essential infrastructure for productive life fostered a sense of trust in government as a benevolent force, rather than an oppressive one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56">[27:56]</a>. Furthermore, a lot of migration was assisted by the government, which helped migrants get to Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25">[28:25]</a>. This historical context of government provision and low direct taxation contributed significantly to Australians' positive expectations of state capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39">[09:39]</a>.

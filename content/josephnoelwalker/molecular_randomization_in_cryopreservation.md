In contrast to human-designed objects, a cell functions much like a "bag of molecules" that is constantly being shaken [00:00:00]. Molecules within a cell are not guaranteed to be in a particular place unless they are very strongly bonded there [00:00:03]. This perspective helps to explain the surprising possibility of [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreservation]] [00:00:11]. It is considered incredibly strange that any biological material can be [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreserved]] and subsequently rewarmed [00:00:14]. For instance, resected brain tissue can be cooled to minus 130Â°C and below [00:00:21].

## [[cryopreservation_techniques | Cryopreservation]] and Molecular Motion

[[cryopreservation_techniques | Cryopreservation]] can be likened to a complicated factory where all workers are stopped, spun around, and then begin walking in completely random directions [00:00:29]. Essentially, [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreservation]] randomizes the molecular motion of all molecules when they are subjected to very low temperatures [00:00:44].

Most structures built by humans are incompatible with this kind of randomization [00:00:55]. We generally lack systems that remain invariant to such molecular disarray [00:00:57]. However, cells, for some reason, possess this invariance [00:01:01].

## [[cellular_properties_and_evolution | Cellular Properties]] and [[thermal_noise_and_cellular_resilience | Thermal Noise]]

Cells primarily operate through passive diffusion, meaning their functions rely on molecules bouncing about in random directions [00:01:10]. This fundamental [[cellular_properties_and_evolution | property]] of cells, where they run with very high amounts of [[thermal_noise_and_cellular_resilience | thermal noise]], is directly linked to why [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreservation]] is effective [00:01:19].

Cells have evolved to possess [[cellular_properties_and_evolution | properties]] that make them remarkably invariant to the type of randomization induced by [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreservation]] [00:01:23]. It would be unusual to expect such resilience in any other system [00:01:30].

Evaluating rejected candidates is a crucial practice for talent scouts and project selectors, particularly in fields like grant allocation. This process helps ensure that selection criteria are appropriately applied and that sufficient [[risk_assessment_in_talent_scouting | risk is being taken]] in selections.

## Initial Reevaluation Prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

Early in the process of selecting grant winners, a key question was posed by Tyler: "Are you taking enough risk? Where's the [[importance_of_failure_rate_in_talent_selection | failure rate]]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> This prompted a careful reevaluation of past decisions, a type of question not commonly asked when projects are already succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Purpose of Evaluating Rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

The core objective was to analyze why grants were withheld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The reevaluation aimed to determine if rejections were due to projects being excessively risky or "out there," or if other, more problematic issues were at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Findings from Initial Assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>

Surprisingly, the assessment revealed that none of the rejections were primarily due to the inherent riskiness of the proposed project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Instead, common reasons for rejection included:
*   The applicant not having a sufficiently fleshed-out idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   The project not being risky *enough*, often described as "cookie cutter" or boring, raising the question of whether such a project was truly needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

This analysis ultimately provided comfort regarding the level of risk being taken in the selections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Ongoing Reevaluation as Best Practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>

For new talent scouts, it is considered useful to perform this reevaluation exercise every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This involves reviewing past rejections and asking:
*   Was the initial rejection the correct decision? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   What was the rationale behind that decision? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   Does the rationale still hold true after several months and more experience with [[challenges_in_acquiring_research_grants | grant selections]]? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

This periodic [[importance_of_reevaluation_in_project_selection | reevaluation]] helps refine decision-making and selection criteria over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

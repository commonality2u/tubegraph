The United States has yet to commit to a "whole of nation" effort to address China's rise as a great power, despite the economic challenge it poses being significantly larger than previous historical rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Lack of Presidential Leadership
No American president since China's rise in the early post-Cold War years has declared the challenge posed by China as a national mission requiring the entire country's devotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Such a declaration is considered necessary for a "whole of nation" effort, which is deemed bigger than the [[comparison_of_china_challenge_to_cold_war | Cold War]] in most respects, particularly economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

China's GDP now surpasses 60% of American GDP, making it a much larger economic challenge than the [[comparison_of_china_challenge_to_cold_war | Cold War]] and already a bigger challenge than Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Despite this, a public call for a national effort, led by the President, has not occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Intellectual and Cultural Readiness
The [[us_intellectual_and_cultural_readiness_for_china_challenge | intellectual environment in the US]] does not indicate that the nation is primed for a contest of this scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This readiness is absent in popular culture, where figures like Joe Rogan are not widely "obsessed" with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

While a significant amount of scholarship, think tank analysis, and articles in journals like *Foreign Affairs* exist on the "China Challenge" and "China Threat" within the [[beltway_community_vs_popular_culture_on_china_threat | Beltway community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, this discourse does not extend broadly beyond this circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

The current situation does not resemble:
*   The [[comparison_of_china_challenge_to_cold_war | Cold War]], which saw the development of "Cold War liberalism" as an entire school of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   The War on Terrorism, which generated widespread intellectual ferment and debate among prominent public commentators and major media outlets like *The New York Times* on how to maintain liberal democracy against radical threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

The necessary "intellectual ferment" to support the scale of the challenge that the American governing class claims to be undertaking is currently lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

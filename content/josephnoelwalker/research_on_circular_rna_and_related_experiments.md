Early research into the application of circular RNA began in 1989 at the University of Pennsylvania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. As a research assistant professor in a non-tenure position, the researcher aimed to establish their own lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Grant Applications and Proposals

For the first two years, monthly grant applications were submitted to secure funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The proposals focused on how circular RNA could be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Although circular RNA is sometimes considered a new concept, proposals detailing its use were already being submitted as early as 1992-1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. However, all these grant applications were rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## [[criticism_and_feedback_on_rna_research_proposals | Criticism and Feedback]]

The grant reviewers provided [[criticism_and_feedback_on_rna_research_proposals | feedback]], often stating that the RNA was "label" and "wouldn't be useful," or that there wasn't sufficient data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. On occasion, the researcher's knowledge to conduct the proposed experiments was questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. In response to this [[criticism_and_feedback_on_rna_research_proposals | feedback]], the researcher focused on improving their grant writing, seeking input from colleagues, and conducting more experiments to generate additional data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Despite working hard to perform experiments and gather data related to circular RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, the data was still considered insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## University Outcome

A university policy stipulated that faculty members in non-tenure track positions had five years to establish themselves and secure funding; failing this, they would either be promoted or removed from the faculty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Due to the lack of successful grant funding and establishment, the researcher was removed from the faculty in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

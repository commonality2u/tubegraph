An individual recounted their experience of financial challenges and leveraging the black market while emigrating from communist Hungary to America in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Initial Financial Constraints

The individual learned at their 30th birthday that they had six months left at "The Institute" to find another job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This was their first time being "kicked out," an experience they stated was crucial for their later success, emphasizing the importance of not taking such setbacks personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

When preparing to move to America, the communist Hungarian authorities restricted movement by limiting the amount of money families could take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The family, consisting of the individual, their husband, and their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter, was only allowed to take $50 for the daughter and $50 for the husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The individual was told to ask their employer for their portion of the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This meant a small family was expected to leave Hungary with just $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## The Black Market and Currency Exchange

To overcome these severe financial limitations, the family resorted to the black market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. They sold their Russian car, which was an official transaction, but then had to exchange the Hungarian currency on the black market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This was done with students from Arabic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The exchange resulted in pounds, which were equivalent to approximately $800 to $1200 USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This was necessary because Hungarian currency was not convertible, meaning one could not freely purchase foreign currency with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Furthermore, it was against the law to possess foreign currency; if one received it, they had to exchange it at the bank for Hungarian currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Despite being illegal, the family undertook this to be able to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_smuggling_money | Smuggling Funds]]

To bring the black market funds out of Hungary, the family employed [[strategies_for_smuggling_money | a unique method]] of concealment. They hid the money inside their daughter Susan's teddy bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The individual wrapped the money, stitched it inside the teddy bear, and then vigilantly watched at the airport to ensure the bear was not left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The daughter, being only two and a half years old, was unaware of the money hidden inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Other Hungarians shared similar experiences of having to find ways to carry extra money out of the country, as coming to America with only $100 was not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

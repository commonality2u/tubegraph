The concept of an inflation target, particularly the widely adopted 2% figure, is a significant element of modern monetary policy. However, adjusting this target presents considerable challenges due to its perceived arbitrary nature, the implications of changing it, and the need for consistency.

## The Origin and Rationale of the 2% Target
The 2% inflation target was chosen similarly to the [[comparison_between_inflation_targets_and_capital_requirements | Basel Capital requirements]] (initially 8%), appearing as a "reasonable thing" that was "not too close to zero and not too high up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The [[rationale_behind_the_2_inflation_target | rationale behind the 2% inflation target]] is that it allows for some inflation that is "noticeable" but not bothersome, meaning "nobody really cares about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Studies typically suggest that inflation becomes a problem when it reaches "double digits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The concern with higher inflation is that it "can start getting a life of its own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, leading to absolute price movements rather than just relative ones, and fostering "generalized inflation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The ideal is a low inflation level that keeps things anchored, allowing for relative price movements without broad absolute shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## The Importance of Consistency Over Specificity
Despite the seemingly arbitrary nature of the 2% number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, what truly matters is that the chosen target is "low" and that central banks "hit them consistently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The specific figure picked is less important than ensuring it remains "below the radar screen of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Challenges in Adjusting the Target
The idea of moving the inflation target, for instance, from 2% to 4%, presents significant [[challenges_of_policy_innovation_and_implementation | challenges of policy innovation and implementation]]:

*   **Perception of Admitting Defeat**: If inflation is already above 2% and a central bank proposes raising the target to 4%, it can be perceived as "admitting defeat" because they "can't get back to two" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Lack of Credibility when Inflation is Low**: Conversely, if a central bank is struggling to reach the 2% target (as was the case for the FED, which had inflation around 1.2% over a decade before the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>), suggesting a higher target like 4% can seem "a little ridiculous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Historical Context**: Prior to the pandemic, the FED faced challenges in getting inflation up to its 2% target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Instead of changing the numerical target, it adjusted its framework to be "more accommodating of inflation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, demonstrating a preference for strategic adjustments over shifting the goalposts.

In summary, while the specific inflation target might be arbitrary, the act of changing it is fraught with difficulties, primarily because it can undermine public confidence and central bank credibility.

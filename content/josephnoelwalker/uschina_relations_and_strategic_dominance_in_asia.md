The United States is unlikely to engage China in a conflict for strategic dominance in Asia because it lacks vital interests in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:58">[04:59:58]</a>. This perspective contrasts with the traditional view of the [[USChina economic and military dynamics | US-China economic and military dynamics]] and the scale of the challenge China presents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

## The Scale of the China Challenge

China's economic challenge already surpasses that of Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. In most respects, it represents a bigger challenge than the [[comparison_of_china_challenge_to_cold_war | Cold War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. China has also surpassed 60% of American GDP, a threshold no other power or group of powers has previously approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

## Lack of "Whole of Nation" Effort

Despite the immense scale of the [[USChina economic and military dynamics | China challenge]], no [[role_of_american_presidents_in_addressing_china | American president]] since China's rise as a great power has declared it a national mission requiring the devotion of the entire country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. Such an effort would need to be a "whole of nation" endeavor, not just a "whole of government" one, and it cannot be a quiet or solely [[beltway_community_vs_popular_culture_on_china_threat | Beltway community vs popular culture on China threat]] project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

## US Intellectual and Cultural Readiness

The [[us_intellectual_and_cultural_readiness_for_china_challenge | US intellectual and cultural readiness for China challenge]] suggests that the United States is not adequately prepared for a contest of this magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

### Absence in Popular Culture
There is a noticeable absence of the China challenge in popular culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. For instance, popular commentators like Joe Rogan are not "obsessed" with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

### Disparity between Beltway and Broader Intellect
While American scholars, think tanks, political advisors, and military analysts are extensively writing about China, and publications like *Foreign Affairs* are "chalk full" of articles on the [[american_political_stance_on_chinas_rise | China challenge and China threat]], this concern does not extend beyond the [[beltway_community_vs_popular_culture_on_china_threat | beltway crowd]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Broader intellectual figures like David Brooks and Ross Douthat are not authoring books on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

This situation differs significantly from the [[comparison_of_china_challenge_to_cold_war | Cold War]], which fostered an entire school of thought known as "Cold War liberalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. It also doesn't compare to the "War on Terrorism," which saw widespread intellectual engagement on how to maintain liberal democracy against the radical Islamist threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. The current lack of intellectual ferment indicates insufficient support for the scale of the challenge that the American governing class claims to be undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

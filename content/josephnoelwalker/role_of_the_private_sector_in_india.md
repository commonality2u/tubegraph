In India, the private sector is tasked with building and designing numerous hardware solutions that are largely taken for granted in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This contrasts with the US, where [[public_goods_in_the_us_versus_india | public goods]] are generally assumed to be in place, allowing the private sector to focus on other areas, particularly digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Investment Trends in Hardware vs. Software

There is a significant mismatch in investment focus within the Indian market. Venture Capital (VC) firms, both Indian and American, tend to overlook hardware solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This preference stems from the perceived lower product risk associated with software development, which can be created by a small team in a few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The primary risk for software is seen as market risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

In contrast, hardware solutions, such as air pollution devices, are often perceived by VCs to carry both product risk and market risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Product Risk vs. Market Risk

For hardware solutions in India:
*   **Market Risk:** Is actually very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, as indicated by numerous advertisements for such products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Product Risk:** Is quite high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The VC world's deep integration with digital goods, rather than physical manufacturing, prevents them from accurately assessing these risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This creates a missed opportunity, described as "$20 bills lying on the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Role of Angel Investors

While [[indian_versus_american_venture_capital_approaches | American VCS]] and Indian VCs (who often mimic their American counterparts) tend to miss these hardware opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, angel investors in India are actively funding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. These angels possess the necessary experience, having built similar solutions before, and understand how to de-risk product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Venture capitalists, however, primarily focus on product-to-market fit, influenced by a VC model that excels where product risk is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This approach may not be suitable for the Indian market, where product risk is a significant consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

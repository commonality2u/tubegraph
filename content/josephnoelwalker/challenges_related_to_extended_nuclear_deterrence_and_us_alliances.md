The credibility of extended nuclear deterrence, particularly for US allies like Australia, is facing significant challenges in the current geopolitical landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:30">[05:54:30]</a>. This includes public opinion shifts, the influence of defense pacts, and the inherent dilemmas of nuclear strategy.

## Shifting Public Opinion on Nuclear Weapons in Australia

A 2022 Lowy Institute poll revealed that approximately 36% of Australians either support or strongly support Australia acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This figure was unexpected by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

The announcement of AUKUS in August 2021 was a significant factor influencing this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. Historically, Australia had strong anti-nuclear campaigns in the 1980s, led by figures like Peter Garrett and the Greens Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. However, when the Morrison government announced AUKUS in September 2021, the expected backlash against nuclear power did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. While there was opposition to AUKUS itself, there was no popular [[reactions_to_australias_potential_nuclear_developments | reaction to the idea of Australia]] operating nuclear reactors, for instance, in Sydney Harbour or HMAS Stirling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. This newfound public acceptance of nuclear power likely influenced the opposition's decision to announce civilian nuclear power as an election promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

Poll questions often present scenarios without [[prerequisites_for_australia_to_consider_acquiring_nuclear_weapons | counterfactuals]], meaning Australians are not asked if they would want nuclear weapons if it incurred specific costs or trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This suggests that the public may not have fully considered the implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## [[prerequisites_for_australia_to_consider_acquiring_nuclear_weapons | Prerequisites for Australia to Consider Acquiring Nuclear Weapons]]

For Australia to consider acquiring its own nuclear weapons, several basic preconditions would need to be met:

1.  **Proliferation in the Region**: Australia is less likely to go nuclear before closer countries facing more acute security dilemmas with China do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Japan and South Korea, for example, have more immediate concerns regarding their security dilemmas with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Taiwan, however, would likely not go nuclear because its open society and deep penetration by Chinese intelligence services would make it impossible to keep such a program secret, triggering an immediate invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. If the US alliance or extended nuclear deterrent were to weaken for Japan and South Korea, they might choose to go nuclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Thus, Japan and probably Korea would need to go nuclear first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

2.  **Indonesian Acquiescence**: Indonesia would need to be accepting of, or preferably cooperative with, Australia's nuclear ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. Without Indonesian cooperation, any problem Australia hoped to solve by acquiring nuclear weapons would be undercut by the problems created with Indonesia, potentially turning Indonesia into an adversary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This cooperative step, however, seems unlikely given it would be a significant move for Indonesia as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

## Credibility of Extended Nuclear Deterrence

Extended nuclear deterrence refers to an agreement where a nuclear-armed state pledges to use its nuclear weapons in defense of an ally if that ally is threatened with nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. The bargain is that allies do not need to develop their own nuclear weapons because they can "borrow" those of the protecting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

The credibility of this bargain is diminishing, particularly exemplified by the Korean case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. With North Korea developing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of hitting US cities like New York or Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>, the implied bargain changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. It now asks the US to potentially sacrifice one or more of its own cities to defend Seoul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. This is seen as an "impossible thing to ask of the Americans" and "not credible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

This assessment is not a judgment on American moral character or courage, but a "cold-blooded assessment about its vital interests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. It is argued that America's allies are asking something "ridiculous" and "impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. Consequently, South Korea has concluded it must develop more independent capabilities to counter the North Korean threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. In contrast, Australia and Japan have chosen to further tie themselves to the United States, doubling defense spending and strengthening alliance ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. The South Korean approach is considered more credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.

## Challenges to a Policy Shift in Australia

A fundamental shift away from relying on extended nuclear deterrence would require a "huge cultural shift" in Australia, which its two major parties might not be capable of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. The US-Australia alliance is deeply embedded in bureaucracies, including intelligence cooperation like the Five Eyes arrangement and defense departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. Australian personnel are embedded within US commands like Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.

Furthermore, the alliance is held together by the political culture of both major parties, with both Labor and Liberal claiming the alliance as their own creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. Historically, the Labor Party only achieved an extended period of government during the Cold War when it fully reconciled with the US alliance and its opposition to communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. This deep embedding suggests that fundamental reassessments of the alliance relationship are doubted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

## [[implications_of_nuclear_blackmail_and_deterrence_by_countries_like_china | Implications of Nuclear Blackmail and Deterrence by Countries Like China]]

While the "vestiges" of extended nuclear deterrence may persist, its direct utility for Australia is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. It is difficult to imagine a security crisis where Australia would plausibly be threatened with the use of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.

The most likely way nuclear weapons might be used against Australia is through [[implications_of_nuclear_blackmail_and_deterrence_by_countries_like_china | nuclear blackmail]], where a country like China threatens nuclear use to prevent Australia from engaging in conventional warfare or to achieve its objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

There is a concern that nuclear strategy relies heavily on the Cold War case study, offering limited insight into how future scenarios might unfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. Examples of nuclear blackmail include:
*   Russia's actions in Ukraine, where Putin frequently uses nuclear threats to deter direct US and NATO intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>.
*   The US threatening to use nuclear weapons in the 1950s to prevent China from invading Taiwan, which was effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>.

The argument is that nuclear blackmail only works if the blackmailed party believes the threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>. If Australia can "call the bluff" because China would never actually use nuclear weapons, then the threats would not be credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>. The "taboo" against nuclear use is incredibly strong, making it difficult for any country, especially "little Australia," to be the one to break it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>.

However, even a small probability of nuclear use due to the catastrophic consequences can influence decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>. Ultimately, the question becomes a matter of weighing the costs of risking [[implications_of_nuclear_blackmail_and_deterrence_by_countries_like_china | nuclear blackmail]] against the significant costs and implications of [[nuclear_proliferation_and_its_implications | Australia becoming a nuclear weapons power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>.

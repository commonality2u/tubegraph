Cells operate within an environment characterized by constant motion and inherent randomness, a concept often described as a "bag of molecules" being continuously shaken [00:00:00]. In this dynamic environment, the precise location of molecules is not guaranteed unless they are very strongly bonded [00:00:03]. This fundamental characteristic of [[cellular_properties_and_evolution | cellular properties]] provides crucial insight into the surprising feasibility of processes like [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]] [00:00:11].

## Molecular Randomization

[[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | Cryopreservation]] is an "incredibly strange" process that allows for the cooling and rewarming of tissues, such as resected brain tissue, to temperatures as low as -130Â°C and below [00:00:14]. This process essentially randomizes the molecular motion of all molecules when subjected to very low temperatures [00:00:45].

Consider an analogy: imagine a complex factory where all workers are suddenly stopped, spun around, and then directed to walk in completely random directions at their normal speed. This scenario mirrors the [[molecular_randomization_in_cryopreservation | molecular randomization]] that occurs during [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]] [00:00:29].

## Invariance to Randomization

Unlike most systems designed at the human scale, which are incompatible with such extensive randomization [00:00:55], cells possess a unique resilience. Cells are, for "some reason," invariant to this kind of molecular randomization [00:01:01].

This resilience stems from the fact that cells fundamentally run on passive diffusion, meaning their internal operations depend on molecules bouncing about in random directions [00:01:10]. The ability of cells to withstand the induced randomization during [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]] is linked to their [[cellular_properties_and_evolution | evolutionary]] development [00:01:19]. [[cellular_properties_and_evolution | Cells evolved]] to function effectively amidst high amounts of thermal noise, which equipped them with properties that make them inherently invariant to the molecular randomization induced by [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]] [00:01:23]. This property would be highly unusual for any other system [00:01:30].

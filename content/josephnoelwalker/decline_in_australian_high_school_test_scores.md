The long slide in Australian high school math and literacy scores is identified as one of the most underdiscussed policy problems in Australia, particularly outside of education policy circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This decline in performance has been observed for decades.

## Historical Trends
Australia has been performing poorly on math and literacy scores since the mid-century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Since the early 2000s, PISA scores, which test Year 9 students, have also been deteriorating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This decline is significant, amounting to somewhere between half a year to a year of achievement over the last couple of decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. A typical Year 9 student now scores about where a typical Year 8 student would have scored at the start of the century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Explanations for the Decline

One significant explanation for Australia's declining test scores is linked to teacher quality and historical gender pay discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Impact of Gender Pay Discrimination on Teacher Quality
During the 1960s and 1970s, Australia had a system that attracted very talented teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This was largely a consequence of rampant gender pay discrimination across other professions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Due to this discrimination, talented women were largely excluded from fields like law, medicine, and dentistry, leading to lower quality services in those areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

These talented women overwhelmingly pursued careers in teaching and nursing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This dynamic artificially inflated the academic aptitude of individuals entering the teaching profession in the 1950s and 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

However, through the 1970s and 1980s, gender pay gaps and discrimination in other sectors began to recede <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, particularly after the equal pay cases of 1969 and 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. As talented women flowed into these newly accessible fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, teaching wages did not increase commensurately to maintain the same level of academic talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. In fact, teaching wages lagged behind those of other professional occupations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This shift is evident in the academic aptitude of new teachers from the early 1980s to the early 2000s, and to a lesser extent, in the decade since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

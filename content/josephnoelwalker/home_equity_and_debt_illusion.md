Initially, there was a belief that making credit easier, particularly for home purchases, would benefit individuals by allowing them to capitalize on [[impact_of_easy_credit_on_wealth | house appreciation]] and build wealth in their portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This approach was also seen as alleviating worries, including those related to job security or human capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Political Convergence on Housing Credit Expansion

Both the political right and left converged on the idea of expanding home ownership through easier credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The right viewed having more property owners as a positive development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, while the left aimed for workers to own their homes and become wealthier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This bipartisan agreement led to a push for [[housing_credit_expansion | expanding housing credit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Risks of Excessive Credit

While the expansion of credit itself can be a good idea, it became a movement that went too far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. When credit is pushed too easily, it can cause significant harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Individuals can be negatively impacted if they receive credit at the wrong time, especially when housing prices are rapidly increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. They may struggle to afford the houses themselves or the associated consumption made possible by home equity lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Many who drew down on their home equity lines subsequently faced situations where prices collapsed, leaving them with no equity and deep in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## The Debt Illusion

A key factor contributing to this issue was [[political_pressure_and_credit_availability | political pressure]] on leaders to take action when incomes were not growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Allowing access to credit and home equity created an illusion of prosperity that kept people content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. If incomes remain stagnant, debt or equity becomes the primary means for people to consume more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

The illusion was that individuals were not "borrowing" but merely "drawing down on equity" because their home prices were increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The term "draw down" sounded more favorable than "borrowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. However, the reality was that they were borrowing against appreciation that was becoming increasingly fragile, as it was based on a [[risks_of_a_housing_market_bubble | housing market bubble]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

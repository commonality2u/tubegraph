Cells possess a remarkable ability to remain functional despite significant environmental disruptions, a property that stands in stark contrast to most human-designed systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This resilience is deeply rooted in the fundamental, chaotic nature of their internal environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Chaotic Nature of Cells

A cell can be conceptualized as a "bag of molecules that's being shaken all the time," where molecular motion is constant and largely random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Within this dynamic environment, nothing is guaranteed a specific location unless it is very strongly bonded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Cells operate primarily through passive diffusion, meaning their functionality relies on molecules bouncing about in random directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Cryopreservation as an Example of Cellular Invariance

The possibility of [[cellular_response_to_low_temperatures | cryopreservation]] highlights this inherent cellular invariance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It is considered "incredibly strange" that biological material can be cooled to very low temperatures—for instance, resected brain tissue to minus 130°C and below—and then rewarmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Cryopreservation essentially induces a [[randomization_of_molecular_motion | randomization of molecular motion]] among all the molecules within the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This can be likened to stopping everyone in a factory, spinning them around, and having them walk in random directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. While nearly all human-built systems are incompatible with this kind of randomization and lack invariance to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, cells are uniquely equipped to handle it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Evolutionary Basis for Invariance

The capacity for cells to be invariant to significant environmental shifts, such as the [[randomization_of_molecular_motion | randomization]] induced by [[cellular_response_to_low_temperatures | cryopreservation]], is linked to their evolutionary history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Cells evolved to function effectively with very high amounts of [[thermal_noise_and_cellular_evolution | thermal noise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This evolutionary adaptation endowed them with properties that make them inherently resilient and invariant to the kind of molecular disruption that would render most engineered systems inoperable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

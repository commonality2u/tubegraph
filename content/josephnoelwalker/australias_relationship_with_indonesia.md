Australia's relationship with Indonesia is of paramount strategic importance, particularly as Indonesia is projected to become a great power in the coming decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

## The Imperative of Alliance
The top priority for Australian statecraft should be an alliance with Indonesia, even if it is not a formal one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. Unlike Australia's geographic distance from China, which acts as a "huge buffer" and its "single biggest defense asset," Australia lacks this advantage with Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.

Historically, Australia has benefited from Indonesia being relatively poor and primarily a land rather than a maritime or air power, but this cannot be relied upon indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.

### Indonesia as a Future Great Power
Indonesia is expected to become much wealthier, with a respectable case that by the middle of this century, it will be considered a great power, comparable in economic and strategic weight to Japan, India, France, and Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. It is the natural leader in Southeast Asia, a region currently without a resident great power, making it a natural outlet for Chinese ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.

It is strongly in Australia's interest for Indonesia to assume this leadership role and for Australia to be on Indonesia's side as it rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>. The worst outcome for Australia would be a wealthy Indonesia that is hostile to Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>, which would make Australia one of the "least secure countries in the world," facing a major security threat close to its shores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

### Nature of the Proposed Alliance
The proposed alliance with Indonesia should be based on "purely and narrowly defensive ambitions that are only solely maritime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>. It would explicitly not involve power projection capabilities onto the land mass of any country, including China or any Chinese base in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. This approach aims to exploit distance as Australia's strategic asset by communicating that Australia's intent is "only defensive" and will only be used if attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>. This aligns with [[the_akidna_strategy_for_australias_defense | the akidna strategy]] motif of being "spiky but not threatening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Challenges to Alliance Formation
Several factors pose challenges to forming this alliance:

*   **Indonesia's Strategic Identity**: Indonesia has not yet developed a post-Cold War strategic identity and continues its "non-aligned" stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>. Its strategic community is very small, and there's a lack of imagination to consider a deep alliance with Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>.
*   **Indonesia's Security Focus**: Indonesia primarily looks north for its security concerns, viewing Australia as "not a problem that it needs to deal with," thus lacking the bandwidth to engage in grand terms with Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
*   **Australia's Post-Colonial Mindset**: Some argue that Australia's "Southeast Asia literacy is very poor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>. Australia is perceived as behaving like a "white postcolonial power," not yet mentally ready to treat Indonesia as an equal or a potential great power to which Australia might be subordinate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
*   **[[Implications of the AUKUS agreement on nuclear power | AUKUS Agreement]]**: The [[Implications of the AUKUS agreement on nuclear power | AUKUS agreement]] and Australia's closer relationship with the United States could hinder a partnership with Indonesia, as Indonesia may not be enthusiastic about a quasi-alliance if Australia's alliance with the US becomes "ever closer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>.

## Economic and Societal Ties
While a strong economic relationship would be beneficial, it faces challenges due to a lack of obvious complementarities between the two resource-exporting economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:02">[01:47:02]</a>. The economic relationship with New Zealand is currently larger than with Indonesia, despite Indonesia's population being 55 times greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:11">[01:47:11]</a>. Behind-the-border trade restrictions and corruption in Indonesia also pose hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:40">[01:47:40]</a>.

Another potential avenue for strengthening ties is immigration, which is "puzzlingly anemic" compared to other Southeast Asian diasporas in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:17">[01:48:17]</a>. Australia could consider opening a "special visa category" to encourage an Indonesian diaspora, as immigration has been used as a tool of foreign policy in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.

### Indonesian State Capacity
Indonesia's state capacity generally remains low, impacting its ability to tax, educate citizens, maintain health, and build infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>. While there has been steady improvement since the Suharto period with 5% economic growth and comparable growth in state capacity, Indonesia is still below Thailand or Malaysia in terms of state capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.

In the defense realm, recent procurement projects have been described as "weird," such as acquiring fighter aircraft from three different countries in small batches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>. The Indonesian military (TNI) has traditionally focused on internal security, and while there are pockets of improvement, progress towards a more traditional Western-style military is "halting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>.

The initial objective of certain research was to create therapeutic protein-coding RNA that would not cause inflammation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Inflammatory Nature of Extracellular RNA

Researchers began to question why RNA introduced from outside the cell, particularly to immune cells, was so inflammatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It was posited that this [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | RNA]] is not typically found outside the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

To investigate this, the idea was formed to isolate [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | RNA]] from human cells and compare its immune response in human immune cells (dendritic cells) to that of *in vitro* synthesized [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | RNA]] made in a tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. At this stage, the expectation was that all [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | RNA]] would activate an immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Discovery of Non-Immunogenic RNA

Contrary to initial expectations, testing various types of [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | RNA]], including [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | Transfer RNA]] (tRNA), ribosomal [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | RNA]], and different bacterial [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | RNA]], revealed a significant finding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>:

*   **[[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | Transfer RNA]] (tRNA)** did not induce any immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

This led to the hypothesis that [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | Transfer RNA]]'s non-immunogenic nature might be due to its well-known content of highly [[nucleoside_modification_in_rna | modified nucleosides]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Research Challenges and Insights

The next immediate challenge became proving this hypothesis by creating [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | RNA]] containing [[nucleoside_modification_in_rna | nucleoside modifications]] to observe their effect on immune responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The original goal was not to specifically create non-immunogenic [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | RNA]], but rather to understand if synthetically produced [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | RNA]] differed in its immune properties from [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | RNA]] naturally found within cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

The method involved isolating [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | RNA]] from cells, synthesizing it in a lab, applying it to cells, and observing the immune reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Most [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | RNA]] types tested did induce an immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. While the body's own [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | RNA]] is contained within cells and is not typically inflammatory, its release, such as during an injury, can lead to an inflammatory reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

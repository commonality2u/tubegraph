The Akidna Strategy, proposed by Sam Roggeveen, Director of the Lowy Institute's International Security Program, is a defense concept designed to address Australia's evolving geopolitical challenges. It advocates for Australia to become "spiky but not threatening," leveraging its geographic distance from potential adversaries to ensure self-reliance in defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.

## A Changing Geopolitical Landscape

For over a century, the United States has not faced an adversary whose GDP exceeded 60% of its own. China surpassed this threshold in 2014 and, on a purchasing power parity basis, exceeded US GDP entirely in 2017, now standing more than 20% larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This economic power is being converted into military might <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Roggeveen believes the US lacks the vital interests to fight China for dominance in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, meaning Australia will, for the first time, be without the protection of a great power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Historically, Australia has believed it cannot independently defend its continent from attack by a major Asian power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The Akidna Strategy argues that Australia *can* defend itself without significantly increasing defense spending as a percentage of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Roggeveen posits a "long interregnum" where a balance of power between China and the United States will last for a considerable time, rather than a full US withdrawal from Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. However, he acknowledges that a US president like Donald Trump could accelerate a withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

## Core Principles of the Akidna Strategy

The strategy emphasizes defensive dominance in military technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:01">[03:01:01]</a>. Roggeveen argues that the costs of defensive military technologies are significantly lower than offensive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:01">[03:03:01]</a>.

Key components include:
*   **Defensive Focus**: The goal is to make it extremely expensive for any major power to project military power against Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:01">[03:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:01">[03:09:01]</a>.
*   **Capability**: The strategy focuses on acquiring the capability to sink lots of ships and shoot down lots of planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:01">[03:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:01">[03:20:01]</a>. This is seen as a simple and cost-effective mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:01">[03:26:01]</a>.
*   **Mix of Weapon Systems**: While submarines are important, the strategy emphasizes a mix of assets including maritime patrol aircraft, fast jets, some surface ships, and increasingly, land-based anti-ship weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:01">[04:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:01">[04:08:01]</a>. The preoccupation with submarines has "skewed the national debate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:01">[04:17:01]</a>.
*   **Exploiting Distance**: Geographic distance is considered Australia's "single biggest defense asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:01">[04:55:01]</a>, providing a huge buffer against potential adversaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:01">[04:51:01]</a>. This advantage is undermined by positioning forces closer to potential threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:01">[04:39:01]</a>.
*   **Technological Shift**: The rise of drones and anti-shipping missiles reinforces the vulnerability of large surface ships, supporting the Akidna's focus on cheaper, effective defensive measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:01">[03:22:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:01">[03:48:01]</a>.

## Akidna Strategy vs. AUKUS Agreement

Roggeveen contrasts the Akidna Strategy with the current direction of [[Implications of the AUKUS agreement on nuclear power | AUKUS]], arguing that AUKUS is "provocative to China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:01">[02:58:01]</a>.

*   **Submarine Capabilities**: While Australia proposes to acquire eight nuclear-powered submarines under AUKUS, these submarines will significantly add to America's seaborn deterrent. They could carry 18 to 24 cruise missiles capable of hitting land targets on the Chinese mainland and could also threaten China's nuclear deterrent by hunting ballistic missile submarines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:01">[02:58:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:01">[02:58:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:01">[02:58:01]</a>. This represents a "very serious upgrade in Australian capability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:01">[02:57:01]</a>.
*   **Power Projection**: The Akidna Strategy emphasizes a purely defensive, maritime focus, explicitly *not* projecting power onto the landmass of any country, including China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:01">[04:49:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:01">[04:51:01]</a>.
*   **US Dependence**: Roggeveen views AUKUS as a "running home to mom kind of moment," reinforcing dependence on the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:01">[02:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:01">[02:19:01]</a>. The Akidna Strategy, conversely, aims for [[Australias defense strategy and autonomy | confident independence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:01">[02:23:01]</a>.

## Relationship with Indonesia

A cornerstone of the Akidna Strategy is making an alliance with [[Australias relationship with Indonesia | Indonesia]] the top priority of Australian statecraft, even if not formal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:01">[04:27:01]</a>.

*   **Strategic Rationale**: Indonesia is geographically close, and its potential future as a great power by mid-century makes it a crucial partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:01">[04:22:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:01">[04:25:01]</a>. A wealthy and hostile Indonesia would be the "worst outcome" for Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:01">[04:52:01]</a>. Australia's interest lies in Indonesia becoming the natural leader of Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:01">[04:51:01]</a>.
*   **Nature of the Alliance**: The proposed alliance should be based on "purely and narrowly defensive ambitions that are only solely maritime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:01">[04:58:01]</a>. It would explicitly *not* involve capabilities for power projection onto land masses, distinguishing it from conventional alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:01">[04:47:01]</a>. The goal is to communicate that Australia's intent is "only defensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:01">[04:47:01]</a>.
*   **Challenges**:
    *   Indonesia lacks a clear post-Cold War strategic identity and has not grasped regional leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:01">[04:15:01]</a>.
    *   Indonesia's strategic community is small, and there's a perceived "lack of imagination" regarding such an alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:01">[04:15:01]</a>.
    *   Indonesia primarily looks north for security concerns, not south towards Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:01">[04:15:01]</a>.
    *   [[State capability and policy efficacy in Australia | Indonesian state capacity]] is still low, and its defense modernization is halting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:01">[04:51:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:01">[04:51:01]</a>.
    *   Australia's strong ties with the US (e.g., AUKUS) could deter Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:01">[05:22:01]</a>.
*   **Opportunities**: Australia's current military capabilities offer valuable contributions to Indonesia's defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:01">[05:58:01]</a>. Additionally, fostering an Indonesian diaspora in Australia through special visa categories could build stronger ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:01">[04:47:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:01">[04:48:01]</a>.

## [[Australia and nuclear power | Australia and Nuclear Weapons]]

The Akidna Strategy acknowledges the shifting public opinion on [[Nuclear weapons poll in Australia | nuclear weapons in Australia]]. A 2022 Lowy Institute poll showing 36% support for Australia acquiring nuclear weapons surprised Roggeveen, though less so after [[Australias historical antinuclear stance | AUKUS]] was announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:01">[05:46:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:01">[05:57:01]</a>.

*   **Preconditions for Acquisition**: Australia is unlikely to acquire nuclear weapons before Japan and South Korea, given their more acute security dilemmas with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:01">[05:59:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:01">[05:56:01]</a>. Taiwan is unlikely to go nuclear due to its open society and Chinese intelligence penetration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:01">[05:59:01]</a>.
*   **Credibility of US Extended Deterrence**: Roggeveen argues that America's extended nuclear deterrence (its nuclear umbrella) is not credible in a scenario where a country like North Korea can target US cities with ICBMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:01">[06:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:01">[06:07:01]</a>. It's "impossible" to ask the US to risk cities like Seattle or Los Angeles for Seoul or Sydney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:01">[06:07:01]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Blackmail**: While nuclear blackmail is a risk, Roggeveen believes the "taboo against nuclear use is incredibly high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:01">[06:07:01]</a>, making China's threats potentially incredible against Australia. The costs of Australia becoming a nuclear power are also significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:01">[06:07:01]</a>.

## Overcoming the Fear of Abandonment

[[Australias historical stance on nuclear weapons | Australian defense]] and foreign policy have historically been defined by a "fear of abandonment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:01">[07:13:01]</a>. Roggeveen suggests that Australia is on a trajectory to being abandoned, whether it likes it or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:01">[07:13:01]</a>.

He offers optimism that Australia's defense policy can break from this trend. Australia has already been "utterly transformed by Asian immigration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:01">[07:13:01]</a>, its economy is Asia-focused, and its foreign policy is thoroughly Asia-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:01">[07:13:01]</a>. Defense policy remains the holdout, going "against the trend" of Australia's post-war place in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:01">[07:13:01]</a>.

The "steady decline, relative decline of American power in Asia and shocks such as the one we're suffering right now under the Trump administration are going to force Australia to be more free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:01">[07:13:01]</a>. The new narrative should be one of a confident, independent nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:01">[07:13:01]</a>.

## Economic Coercion and Cyber Warfare

Roggeveen believes Australia's response to recent Chinese economic coercion (e.g., tariffs) provides a good model for the Akidna Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:01">[07:13:01]</a>. Australia did not retaliate but absorbed the pressure without compromising core foreign policy interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:01">[07:13:01]</a>.

Regarding cyber warfare, while it is distance-agnostic, Roggeveen argues it is not militarily decisive alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:01">[07:13:01]</a>. The Ukraine war demonstrated that physical violence is still often required to achieve political goals, as Russian cyberattacks were less effective than high explosives against Ukrainian infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:01">[07:13:01]</a>.

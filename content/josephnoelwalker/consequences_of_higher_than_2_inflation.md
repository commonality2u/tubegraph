While the [[rationale_behind_the_2_inflation_target | 2% inflation target]] is often considered arbitrary, similar to the initial 8% [[comparison_between_inflation_targets_and_capital_requirements | Basel Capital requirements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, it serves as a level where inflation is present but generally unnoticeable to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Inflation typically becomes a significant problem when it reaches double digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Risks of Higher Inflation

The primary concern with higher inflation is its potential to "start getting a life of its own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. When inflation is kept low, price movements remain anchored around the target, reflecting relative price changes rather than absolute ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. However, at higher inflation levels, relative price movements can transform into more absolute price movements, leading to "more generalized inflation" driven by specific factors like rising oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Challenges in Adjusting the Target

[[challenges_in_adjusting_inflation_targets | Changing the inflation target]], for instance, from 2% to 4%, presents significant policy challenges. There is "never a good time to do that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>:
*   If inflation is already significantly above 2%, raising the target to 4% could be perceived as "admitting defeat" in controlling inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   Conversely, if inflation is at or below 2%, advocating for a 4% target seems "a little ridiculous" if the central bank struggles to reach the current 2% goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Before the pandemic, the Federal Reserve faced persistently low inflation, averaging around 1.2% over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Instead of raising the target, the Fed opted to [[challenges_in_adjusting_inflation_targets | change its framework]] to be "more accommodating of inflation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The key objective for the inflation target is not the specific number itself, but rather that it remains "below the radar screen of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

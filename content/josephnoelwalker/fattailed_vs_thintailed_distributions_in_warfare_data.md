The concept of the "Shadow Mean" is crucial for understanding phenomena like warfare, market drawdowns, or deaths from pandemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>. While historical data for these events might appear to follow a thin-tailed distribution, it is naive to assume the underlying process is thin-tailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">00:00:17</a>. A fat-tailed process could be generating the data, but extreme events may take a very long time to manifest, leading fat-tailed distributions to masquerade as thin-tailed ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">00:00:26</a>.

## Understanding the Shadow Mean

The mean derived from observed data is the "sample mean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">00:00:40</a>. The "shadow mean," conversely, represents the population mean or the mean of the actual underlying process generating the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">00:00:47</a>.

### Gaussian (Thin-Tailed) Distributions

For a Gaussian (thin-tailed) distribution, events that happen less than 1% of the time have minimal impact on the overall probability, as their likelihood decreases rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">00:01:41</a>. Consequently, even with a small sample, the "shadow mean" effect is not significant, and the sample mean closely approximates the true mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">00:01:50</a>. An example is human height, where observing a group of people provides a good estimate of the average height in a town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">00:02:01</a>.

### Fat-Tailed Distributions

In contrast, for open-ended and fat-tailed distributions, most observations will fall below the true mean, leading to a downward bias when computing the empirical mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">00:02:21</a>. The observed mean thus underestimates the true mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">00:03:22</a>. This phenomenon is evident in areas like the S&P 500, where stress-testing using only 10 years of past data for extreme deviations would be insufficient due to an inadequate sample size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">00:02:39</a>. Similarly, in heavy-tailed industries like biotech, the observed mean is less than the true mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">00:03:03</a>.

This concept was elaborated in *The Black Swan* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">00:04:47</a>. A "100-year flood," by definition, will not be observed in merely five years of data, highlighting the presence of a shadow mean when data is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">00:04:56</a>.

## Application to Warfare Data

The shadow mean concept has been specifically applied to warfare data, with published work appearing in *Physica A* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">00:04:23</a>. For war, the historical process observed significantly underestimates the true process, by roughly three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">00:04:07</a>.

### Interarrival Time and Statistical Insights

A key finding from this research is that the [[interarrival_time_and_its_significance_in_predicting_wars | interarrival time]] for wars with over 10 million deaths is approximately 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">00:05:13</a>. World War II, which concluded nearly 80 years ago, was the last conflict of this scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">00:05:31</a>. However, this absence of extreme events does not allow for an inference that violence is in decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">00:05:37</a>.

The [[interarrival_time_and_its_significance_in_predicting_wars | interarrival time]] of wars exhibits an exponential distribution, making it memoryless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">00:05:47</a>. This means that if a war is expected, on average, every 100 years and has not occurred in 100 years, the expectation for its arrival remains the same; it does not become "more due" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">00:06:06</a>.

### Factors Contributing to Fat-Tailed Warfare

The fat-tailed nature of war can be attributed to several structural explanations:
*   **Increasing Destructive Technologies**: The development of more destructive technologies allows for greater lethality. What once required significant manual effort now necessitates much less, as the process of killing has become industrialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">00:06:28</a>.
*   **Globalization and Spread of Violence**: The interconnectedness of the world can facilitate the rapid spread of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">00:06:30</a>.
*   **Incompetent Foreign Policy**: Decision-making errors in foreign policy, particularly by major powers, can inadvertently exacerbate global instability. A perceived "incompetence dressed in sophistication" makes the world more dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">00:07:41</a>.

### Consistency of Fat-Tailedness Over Time

The "fatness" of the war distribution, or its scale (alpha), remains consistent even when examining historical data further back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">00:08:56</a>. While death counts in the past were often exaggerated by both conquerors (to intimidate) and victims (to valorize suffering) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">00:09:17</a>, rigorous statistical analysis has shown that this exaggeration does not alter the underlying fat-tailed structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">00:09:28</a>. By taking different historical accounts for each war and randomizing between high and low estimates (e.g., French vs. Algerian figures for the Algerian War), and creating 150,000 histories, researchers found that all permutations yielded the same alpha value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">00:09:33</a>.

### Implications for Global Violence Trends

Due to the long [[interarrival_time_and_its_significance_in_predicting_wars | interarrival times]] for major conflicts, a period of about 300 years without a World War II-scale conflict would be needed to statistically conclude that the distribution has fundamentally changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">00:13:05</a>. The 80 years since World War II provide no [[statistical_perspectives_on_global_violence_trends | statistical grounds]] to assert that violence has declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">00:13:33</a>. While data-generating processes could change, there's currently no evidence to overturn the null hypothesis that they haven't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">00:13:57</a>. Thus, from a statistical standpoint, there's no basis to claim a decline in violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">00:14:33</a>.

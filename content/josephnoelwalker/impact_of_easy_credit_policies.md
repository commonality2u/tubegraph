Initially, there was a belief that making credit easier, particularly for housing, would benefit individuals and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This approach was seen as a way to enhance personal wealth through house appreciation and ease financial worries, especially for those with inadequate human capital or job security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Initial Intent and Political Support

Both sides of the political spectrum found common ground in expanding housing credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The political right envisioned more property owners within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, while the left aimed for workers to own their homes and accumulate wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

A significant driver for this policy was [[role_of_political_pressure_in_credit_expansion | political pressure]] to address stagnant income growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. If incomes weren't increasing, consumption could only grow through debt or equity, and expanding credit offered a solution that kept people content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Negative Consequences

While initially well-intentioned, the expansion of credit became excessive, evolving into a movement that ultimately caused harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The widespread availability of credit pushed too easily can detrimentally affect even those who receive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:
*   Individuals might receive credit at an inopportune time when prices are rapidly escalating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   They may find themselves unable to afford the houses they purchased or the increased consumption that easy credit facilitated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   A common pitfall was the [[consequences_of_borrowing_against_home_equity | drawing down on home equity lines]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This created an illusion that people weren't borrowing because their home prices were rising, making "drawing down" sound better than "borrowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. However, when property prices collapsed, many found they had no equity left and were deeply in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   Ultimately, this involved borrowing against an appreciation that was increasingly fragile, built upon a housing bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

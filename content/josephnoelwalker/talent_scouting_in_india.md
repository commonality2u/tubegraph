Early in the process of selecting "India winners," a talent scout was challenged by Tyler to consider if they were taking enough [[risk_assessment_in_talent_selection | risk]] given the high success rate of their chosen candidates, questioning the absence of failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This unique inquiry prompted a deep dive into the selection process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Approach to Risk and Failure
The talent scout embarked on a [[rejection_analysis_in_talent_scouting | rejection analysis]], reviewing all the projects and individuals who were *not* awarded grants to understand the reasons behind their rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This was done to ascertain if rejections were due to projects being excessively risky or "out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Findings from Rejection Analysis
Surprisingly, the assessment revealed that none of the rejections were primarily due to the inherent [[risk_assessment_in_talent_selection | riskiness]] of the project itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Instead, the reasons for rejection were twofold:
*   **Unfleshed Ideas** The individual presenting the idea did not have it fully developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Lack of Risk** Often, projects were rejected because they were not risky *enough*; they were "cookie cutter" or "boring" and did not present a novel solution to a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

This analysis ultimately led the scout to feel comfortable with the level of [[risk_assessment_in_talent_selection | risk]] they were already undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Continuous Review
For new talent scouts, it is recommended to conduct this [[rejection_analysis_in_talent_scouting | rejection analysis]] exercise every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This ongoing review involves re-evaluating past rejections to determine if the initial decision was correct and to assess if perspectives have shifted after gaining more experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

High inflation introduces several economic challenges. While a 2% inflation rate is often set as a target because it is noticeable but generally not a significant concern for the public, higher rates can lead to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Studies indicate that inflation typically becomes a significant issue when it reaches double-digit figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Inflation Becomes Self-Perpetuating

A primary concern with elevated inflation is its tendency to gain momentum and become self-sustaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. When inflation is low, such as at 2%, prices tend to remain [[price_stability_and_inflation_anchoring | anchored]] around that rate, and price movements are largely relative (e.g., one good becoming more expensive relative to another) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. At higher levels of inflation, relative price movements can transform into more absolute price movements, leading to a more generalized inflation across the economy, as seen with rising oil prices, for instance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Challenges of Changing Inflation Targets

Shifting an inflation target, such as moving from 2% to 4%, poses significant [[challenges_of_changing_inflation_targets | challenges of changing inflation targets]] for central banks like the Federal Reserve (FED) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. If inflation is significantly above the existing target, raising the target can be perceived as an admission of defeat, suggesting the central bank is unable to bring inflation back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Conversely, if inflation is at or below the target, suggesting a higher target might seem illogical, especially if the immediate challenge is to raise inflation to the current target, which was the case for the FED before the pandemic when inflation was around 1.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The FED's response was to modify its framework to be more accommodating of inflation rather than outright changing its numerical target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

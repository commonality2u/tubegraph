Australia's demographic trajectory, marked by stagnant productivity and rising dependency ratios, has led to a reliance on high population growth, primarily driven by net migration, as a perceived solution to long-term economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. However, this strategy has created significant [[causes_of_the_housing_crisis_in_australia | second-order consequences]], particularly for housing affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.

## Historical Perspective on Population Goals

Former Treasury Secretary Ken Henry recalls a conversation with then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in November 2007, where Rudd inquired about Australia's sustainable population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:03:07]</a>. At the time, Australia's population was around 22-23 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>. Henry suggested approximately 15 million, contrasting with Rudd's initial thought of 50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>. Henry maintained that the then-current population was unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.

Despite this, Henry noted that a population of 50 million could be sustainable with the right policies, provided serious consideration is given to where people would live and the necessary creative policy design for [[australias_state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | infrastructure]] and good living standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:04:10]</a>. Following these discussions, Rudd appointed a population minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:53">[01:03:53]</a>.

## Challenges of Current Growth Patterns

Current policies are seen as insufficient to manage Australia's desired population distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">[01:04:39]</a>. The continued concentration of growth in major cities, such as Sydney and Melbourne, which each saw population increases of 150,000 in a single year, is a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:44]</a>. This rapid growth within existing urban footprints contributes to [[causes_of_the_housing_crisis_in_australia | housing affordability]] issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a> and congestion externalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:40">[01:59:40]</a>.

Economists often suggest an optimal city size of around 150,000 to 200,000 people, a stark contrast to the growth rates experienced by Australia's largest cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:30">[02:10:37]</a>.

## Alternative Urban Development Strategies

Henry proposes a more deliberate approach to urban planning, including the potential for building major new cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:59">[01:09:01]</a>. He suggested an alternative to expanding existing metropolises to 8 million people might be creating 10 new cities of 1 million people each along the Sydney to Melbourne corridor, potentially linked by high-speed rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:24]</a>.

The traditional argument against high-speed rail in Australia often cites a lack of population density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:35]</a>. However, Henry suggests a reversal of this thinking: perhaps the lack of density is precisely *because* high-speed rail hasn't been developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:43]</a>.

Unlike countries like China, which frequently plan for new urban centers to accommodate millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:36]</a>, Australian "thought leaders" and economists are generally uncomfortable with such "planning from on high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:12]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Regional Growth

For new cities or regional centers to succeed, there needs to be an underlying reason for people to live there, primarily related to employment and the presence of industries capable of generating good incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:10:02]</a>. Henry provides the example of Port Macquarie, which became the fastest-growing city in New South Wales despite having no manufacturing or primary industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:43]</a>. Its growth was triggered by the construction of a new hospital through a public-private partnership, which attracted health professionals and led to a boom in residential and ancillary healthcare services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:13:16]</a>. This transformation demonstrates that intentional policy decisions can create opportunities for growth in non-traditional sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:48">[01:14:57]</a>. The key is to determine "why would anybody want to live here and who would want to live here?" before considering specific industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:27">[01:14:46]</a>.

## Fertility Rate and Policy Levers

Discussions around population also touch upon fertility rates. Henry's research indicated that the optimal rate of population growth, which minimizes the total dependency ratio (young and old dependents divided by the workforce), is the replacement rate, around 2.1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:16:19]</a>. However, when fertility rates plummet, as Australia's did in the late 1960s and early 1970s (from over 4.0 in the post-war period to around 1.7-1.8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:34">[01:18:22]</a>, it creates a demographic challenge where a smaller workforce supports a growing elderly population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:29">[01:18:42]</a>.

While policies like the "baby bonus" seemed to have a surprisingly immediate effect on birth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:12]</a>, returning to above-replacement fertility would require significantly more investment beyond a one-off payment, including comprehensive childcare support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:34">[01:20:07]</a>.

## Underlying Issues and Policy Implications

Ken Henry argues that Australia's current population growth challenges, particularly related to [[link_between_immigration_policy_and_australias_demographic_challenges | immigration policy]], stem from a failure to adequately address environmental degradation and congestion externalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:29">[01:59:42]</a>. He advocates for a more "spatially lens" approach to population policy, focusing on *where* people can be accommodated and what skills they bring, rather than just raw numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:48">[02:00:14]</a>.

The current system of overlapping complexities in Commonwealth-State roles and responsibilities in Australia, particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlights a need for a clearer review of roles to deliver better outcomes for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:52]</a>. This re-evaluation could also lead to a more mature conversation about tax bases and the abolition of inefficient state-level taxes like stamp duties and insurance taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:20">[02:07:44]</a>.

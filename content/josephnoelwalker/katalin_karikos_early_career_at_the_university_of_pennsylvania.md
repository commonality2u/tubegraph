Katalin Kariko began her tenure at the University of Pennsylvania in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. She was appointed to a non-tenure [[university_policies_on_faculty_promotion_and_tenure|research assistant professor]] [[university_policies_on_faculty_promotion_and_tenure|faculty position]], which allowed her to have her own laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Challenges in Obtaining Research Funding

From 1989, and for the subsequent two years, Kariko consistently wrote grant applications every month to secure [[challenges_in_obtaining_research_funding_for_rna_work|money]] for her establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, none of these initial grant proposals were successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Research Focus and Grant Rejections

Kariko's [[katalin_karikos_laboratory_work_and_experiments|research]] involved proposing the use of [[circular_rna_research_proposals_and_rejections|circular RNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Although [[circular_rna_research_proposals_and_rejections|circular RNA]] is now considered a novel area, she had already submitted [[circular_rna_research_proposals_and_rejections|grant proposals]] on this topic around 1992-1993, which were subsequently [[circular_rna_research_proposals_and_rejections|rejected]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Despite the [[circular_rna_research_proposals_and_rejections|rejections]], she diligently worked on [[katalin_karikos_laboratory_work_and_experiments|experiments]] to generate more data related to [[circular_rna_research_proposals_and_rejections|circular RNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Critics often cited concerns about the instability of RNA, deeming it not useful, and noted a perceived lack of sufficient data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Occasionally, her knowledge regarding the conduct of these [[katalin_karikos_laboratory_work_and_experiments|experiments]] was also questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Response to Criticism

Instead of interpreting [[circular_rna_research_proposals_and_rejections|rejections]] as a failure on the part of the reviewers, Kariko adopted a mindset of self-improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. She attributed [[circular_rna_research_proposals_and_rejections|rejections]] to potential shortcomings in her own explanations and used feedback to improve her writing, sought input from colleagues, and conducted more [[katalin_karikos_laboratory_work_and_experiments|experiments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Demotion

The University of Pennsylvania had a [[university_policies_on_faculty_promotion_and_tenure|policy]] stating that if a faculty member failed to establish themselves and secure [[challenges_in_obtaining_research_funding_for_rna_work|funding]] within five years, they would either need to be promoted or removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. As a result, Kariko was [[demotion_of_katalin_kariko_in_1995|demoted]] and [[demotion_of_katalin_kariko_in_1995|removed from the faculty]] in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

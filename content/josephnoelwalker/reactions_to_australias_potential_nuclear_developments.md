## Public Opinion on Nuclear Weapons

A 2022 [[low_institute_poll_on_nuclear_weapons_support_in_australia | Low Institute poll]] found that approximately 36% of Australians either support or strongly support Australia acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This statistic on [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons_in_australia | public opinion on nuclear weapons]] in Australia was noted as surprising to observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Interpretation of Poll Data

Poll questions are generally presented without counterfactuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For instance, when Australians are asked if they want nuclear weapons, they are not typically asked about the potential costs or trade-offs involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Public Reaction to Nuclear Power Developments

Despite the historical prevalence of [[historical_perspective_on_antinuclear_sentiment_in_australia | anti-nuclear campaigns]] in Australia, particularly in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, there has been a notable lack of popular reaction to recent nuclear developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

When the [[impact_of_aukus_on_australias_stance_towards_nuclear_power | AUKUS]] agreement was announced, there was an expectation that anti-nuclear campaigns would intensify, but this did not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. There has been no significant popular reaction to the concept of Australia "birthing nuclear reactors," referring to the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This suggests that Australians may be more relaxed about nuclear power than previously assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Mark Cuban is often described as a product of the working-class Jewish diaspora, characterized by being hardworking, gritty, aspirational, and optimistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Family Heritage and Immigration
On his father's side, the Habbiniskis emigrated from Russia through Ellis Island, where his grandfather Morris changed the family name to Cuban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. His maternal grandparents, the Feldmans, were also Jewish and emigrated from Novis Lister in Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Childhood and Early Life
Growing up in Pittsburgh, Cuban's mother worked a rotation of odd jobs, and his father eventually worked in car upholstery for Regency Products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. His household was open-minded and aspirational, though not overly intellectual; his parents read the daily newspaper but there weren't many leather-bound books around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. His mother wanted him to have stability and even feared he might not earn enough money for college, suggesting he get a job laying carpets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Despite this, she supported his decision when he made it into Indiana University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Education and Early Entrepreneurship
Cuban's working-class upbringing and his years working various jobs in college, as well as building his first company, MicroSolutions, combined with his Jewish ancestry, deeply influenced him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The knowledge that a quarter of his mother's family perished during the Holocaust enabled him to empathize with struggling and marginalized people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This background meant he never lost sight of the important role luck plays in people's lives, a rare trait in successful businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

During college, he learned about entertaining customers by owning the best bar in town, Motley's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. He learned that people work hard for their money and want something worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. He realized that if you make it easy and cheap for people to have fun, they will flock to your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Defining Traits
Recurring themes in his life and career include optimism and assertiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Even in his early days as a value-added reseller for Gandalf Technologies, he was known as a straight shooter who didn't tolerate fools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. He maintains a strong focus on hard work and possesses a keen understanding of "the extra two percent" â€“ the power of finding small advantages to turn good businesses into great ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

He exhibits intellectual fearlessness, confident in his ability to master any new field with enough effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This trait is demonstrated through diverse experiences such as:
*   Running Motley's during college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>
*   Helping a basketball team win an NBA championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>
*   Learning how a law firm operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>
*   Teaching himself to code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
*   Learning about machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   Earning an A in graduate-level statistics in his first year of college <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>

These experiences instilled in him the belief that he can take intellectual chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. In essence, Mark Cuban is seen as someone who personifies the American Dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. He affirms this description, humorously stating he might use it as his standard answer when asked "Who is Mark Cuban?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

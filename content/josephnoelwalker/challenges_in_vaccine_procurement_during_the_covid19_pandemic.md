Australia's response to the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted both its strengths and weaknesses in [[australias_state_capacity_and_pandemic_response | state capacity]]. While the country demonstrated a high-functioning administrative state and launched the largest economic intervention in its history with JobKeeper, its vaccine procurement strategy was notably problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## The Vaccine Procurement Failure

The central mystery of Australia's policy response to the pandemic was the stark contrast between its highly effective economic measures and its poor vaccine procurement strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Australia "went all in" on primarily two vaccines: the University of Queensland (UQ) vaccine and the AstraZeneca vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This approach differed significantly from strategies like the U.S. Operation Warp Speed, which sponsored up to eight different vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

The UQ vaccine ultimately failed, and the AstraZeneca vaccine proved less efficacious than other available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. As a consequence, Australia experienced the worst vaccination rate of any OECD nation for several months in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Underlying Causes of Failure

### Departmental Issues and Lack of Diverse Viewpoints

A significant contributing factor was identified as systemic issues within the Department of Health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. While the Treasury was present during vaccine discussions, it appeared to be "in the corner" rather than actively participating in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This suggests a potential reluctance by departments to inject themselves into another's business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

Economists faced pushback for attempting to contribute to the vaccine strategy discussion, with many suggesting their expertise was not relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. However, the decision of which vaccines to procure, subject to safety, is fundamentally an economic question involving risk management and insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

A critical error was the perception that advice from the Department of Health was akin to unquestionable medical advice, rather than public health advice that should be subject to economic principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Health bureaucrats, typically focused on individual threat and without a broad social welfare or cost-benefit analysis framework, provided advice that was taken as "gospel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

This highlights a lack of viewpoint diversity, mathematical literacy, and economic training within the medical regulatory complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI), for example, failed to consider counterfactuals or cost-benefit analysis when advising on vaccine rollout delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

### Strategic Misalignments

Two different, but not mutually exclusive, strategic errors have been identified:

*   **Failure to buy insurance**: The primary flaw was not diversifying vaccine purchases to mitigate risk, akin to failing to buy insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. This limited Australia's options for rapid vaccination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.
*   **Violation of the Tinbergen Rule**: The decision to pick UQ and AstraZeneca was influenced by their local manufacturing capability through CSL in Melbourne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. This attempted to use vaccine procurement as industrial policy, violating the Tinbergen rule of having one policy instrument per goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

### "Penny-Pinching" Mindset

The Department of Health's ingrained "penny-pinching" mindset, geared towards cost-saving in normal health spending, proved inappropriate for a crisis of the pandemic's scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. In a scenario where the cost-benefit analysis blows out by orders of magnitude (trillions are bigger than billions), a focus on saving cents per dose on vaccines was a "failure of leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

## Lessons for Future Crises

The experiences of vaccine procurement during COVID-19 provide crucial insights for managing future crises:

*   **Honesty and Transparency**: Be honest about what is known and unknown to maintain public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.
*   **Flexibility and Avoiding Past War Mentality**: Do not fight the last war; tailor responses to the unique nature of the crisis, as standard intuitions may be inappropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.
*   **Maintain Optionality**: Keep options open rather than committing to a narrow strategy, especially in uncertain environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.
*   **Be Willing to Spend**: In a massive market failure like a pandemic, the welfare loss from inaction far outweighs the costs of significant spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.
*   **Avoid Multi-Objective Instruments**: Do not try to achieve multiple policy goals with a single instrument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

Future pandemic preparedness should include:

*   **Reforming the Medical Regulatory Complex**: Broadening the composition of advisory bodies like ATAGI to include diverse expertise beyond pure medical professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Rethinking Regulatory Approaches**: Adjusting regulatory norms (e.g., stage three trials) for urgent, high-fatality crises, given the potential for rapid vaccine development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Quarantine Facilities**: Building specialized quarantine facilities instead of relying on problematic hotel quarantine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:25">[01:49:25]</a>.
*   **Domestic Manufacturing Capability**: Continuing to develop sovereign mRNA manufacturing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:55">[01:49:55]</a>.

[!WARNING]
The failure of vaccine procurement strategies, along with other factors, risks eroding public trust and consent, making future effective public health interventions more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. This erosion of public willingness to cooperate is a significant challenge for [[challenges_of_modern_society_and_governance | modern governance]].

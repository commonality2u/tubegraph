Central banks worldwide commonly adopt a 2% inflation target, which is perceived as a reasonable level where inflation is noticeable but generally not a significant concern for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Historically, inflation becomes a problem when it reaches double digits, leaving a considerable gap between the 2% target and problematic levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Purpose of the 2% Target

The primary rationale behind the 2% target is to establish a level of inflation that is low enough to prevent widespread concern among the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This allows for [[price_stability_and_inflation_anchoring | price stability and inflation anchoring]], meaning that economic expectations remain centered around this target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. At this level, price movements are primarily relative, reflecting changes in specific goods or services rather than a general increase in the absolute price level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

In contrast, at higher inflation levels, relative price movements can become more generalized, leading to broader inflation, such as when oil prices increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This higher inflation can begin to develop "a life of its own," leading to [[consequences_of_high_inflation | consequences of high inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Arbitrariness and Consistency

While the specific number of 2% may seem somewhat arbitrary given its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, the effectiveness of the target lies less in the exact figure and more in the commitment to consistently achieving a low inflation rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_changing_inflation_targets | Challenges of Changing Inflation Targets]]

Proposals to raise the inflation target, for instance, from 2% to 4%, face significant [[challenges_of_changing_inflation_targets | challenges of changing inflation targets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>:
*   **Above Target:** If inflation is already above 2% (e.g., at 4%), raising the target can be perceived as an admission of defeat by the central bank, suggesting an inability to return to the original 2% goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Below Target:** If inflation is at or below 2%, attempts to raise the target might seem illogical. Prior to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve faced the opposite problem of inflation being too low, averaging around 1.2% over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Despite suggestions to target 4%, the Fed instead adjusted its framework to be more accommodating of inflation, rather than changing the target itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Ultimately, the exact numerical target is less important than ensuring it remains below the public's "radar screen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

Australia faces a pivotal moment in its defense and foreign policy, historically reliant on the protection of great powers but now confronted with a shifting global order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. The rise of China and the potential re-evaluation of the United States' role in Asia necessitate a new approach to [[australias_defense_strategy_and_autonomy | Australian defense strategy and autonomy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

## The Akidna Strategy

Sam Roggeveen proposes the [[the_akidna_strategy_for_australias_defense | Akidna Strategy]] as a framework for Australia's defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. This strategy advocates for Australia to become "spiky but not threatening," leveraging its geographic distance from potential adversaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. The core idea is to build a defense that is capable of repelling attacks on Australian soil without posing an offensive threat to other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This approach aims to defend the continent from attack by a major Asian power without significantly increasing defense spending as a percentage of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

### Rationale for the Akidna Strategy

The Akidna Strategy is rooted in several key observations about the evolving global landscape:

*   **Changing US Role in Asia**: For over a century, the United States has not faced an adversary whose GDP exceeded 60% of its own, a threshold China crossed in 2014, and surpassed entirely on a purchasing power parity basis in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. This economic power is being converted into military might <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. While some believe the US will fight China for dominance, Roggeveen argues it may not, as it lacks vital interests in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. This means Australia could be without the protection of a great power for the first time in its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
    *   US defense spending has trended downwards since 2011, currently between 3.4-3.5% of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. During the Cold War, it reached 8%, and during the Vietnam War, 6-7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
    *   No American president has declared competition with China a national mission requiring a "whole of nation" effort, unlike the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
    *   The intellectual and popular culture environment in the US does not currently indicate a readiness for a prolonged contest with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
    *   Roggeveen anticipates a "long interregnum" where the US maintains a power-sharing relationship with China, rather than a full withdrawal, due to high bureaucratic barriers to withdrawal and low incentives for rapid force increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This relative decline, where the US posture remains roughly the same while China massively expands its military, is viewed as a low-risk option for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   **Declining Value of Classified Intelligence**: For long-term international issues like America's decline or China's rise, classified intelligence offers negligible value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. The information revolution has created an environment of "information super abundance," making the challenge one of understanding existing open-source information rather than uncovering new secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
*   **Defensive Dominance**: The [[the_akidna_strategy_for_australias_defense | Akidna Strategy]] draws comfort from the era of defensive dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. The Ukraine war demonstrates that large surface ships are increasingly vulnerable to cheap anti-shipping missiles and drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This reinforces the idea that projecting military power against Australia primarily involves sending ships or aircraft, which can be countered defensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. The main factor that could shift this balance is if it becomes radically cheaper to shoot down missiles and drones, possibly through technologies like lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### Key Components of the Akidna Defense

The Akidna Strategy focuses on capabilities to sink ships and shoot down planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>:

*   **Submarine Fleet**: While not specifying an exact number, the strategy suggests a significant submarine fleet, at least eight, possibly up to 12 or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This allows for at least three submarines at sea at any given time, covering key thoroughfares between Australia and Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. The focus is on *what* submarines do (sinking ships and other submarines) rather than just the number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. The overall force structure should be a mix of submarines, maritime patrol aircraft, fast jets, some surface ships, and land-based anti-ship weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   **Relationship with Indonesia**: A top priority for [[state_capability_and_policy_efficacy_in_australia | Australian statecraft]] should be an alliance with [[australias_relationship_with_indonesia | Indonesia]], even if not formal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.
    *   Indonesia is geographically close, lacking the buffer distance provides against China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
    *   Indonesia is projected to become the world's fourth-largest economy by 2045, potentially a great power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
    *   It is in Australia's interest for Indonesia to be the natural leader in Southeast Asia, ensuring it is on Australia's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
    *   A wealthy and hostile Indonesia would be the "worst outcome" for Australia, making it one of the least secure countries in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
    *   The proposed alliance would be purely defensive and maritime, explicitly avoiding capabilities for "power projection" onto land masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. The intent would be to communicate that Australia will only use force if attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
    *   Challenges include Indonesia's small strategic community and its tendency to look north for security, not south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. [[implications_of_the_aukus_agreement_on_nuclear_power | AUKUS]] and Australia's close relationship with the US could also hinder an alliance with Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
    *   While Australia currently has a technological edge, Indonesia's defense spending is less than 1% of its GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. Increasing it to 2% would transform its forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. However, [[australias_state_capacity_and_pandemic_response | Indonesian state capacity]] generally is still low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Weapons**: A 2022 Lowy Institute poll showed 36% of Australians support or strongly support acquiring [[australia_and_nuclear_power | nuclear weapons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. This unexpected result, especially after the lack of public backlash against [[implications_of_the_aukus_agreement_on_nuclear_power | AUKUS]] and the presence of nuclear reactors in Australia, suggests a more relaxed public attitude towards [[australia_and_nuclear_power | nuclear power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
    *   Roggeveen believes Australia acquiring [[australia_and_nuclear_power | nuclear weapons]] would only be justified if there is prior proliferation in Japan and South Korea, given their more acute security dilemmas with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
    *   A critical precondition would be Indonesia's acquiescence or cooperation, as Australian proliferation without it would create worse problems than those it aims to solve with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.
    *   The credibility of extended nuclear deterrence (the US using its nuclear weapons in Australia's defense) is questioned. With North Korea capable of striking US cities with ICBMs, the bargain of trading a US city for an allied city becomes "not credible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>.
    *   However, nuclear blackmail, while a risk, might be a "bluff" that Australia could call, given the high global taboo against nuclear use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42">[01:09:42]</a>.
*   **Economic Coercion and Pacific Engagement**: Australia's response to Chinese economic coercion under both Morrison and Albanese governments—not retaliating but not giving in—is seen as a successful application of the [[the_akidna_strategy_for_australias_defense | Akidna Strategy]] in the economic realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Similarly, Australia's bipartisan "Pacific Step Up" program, with aid and defense agreements, aims to align Pacific island countries with Australia, counteracting Chinese influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. The Pacific region is a first-order priority for Australia, unlike for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:25">[01:38:25]</a>.
*   **Cyber and Space Warfare**: These are recognized as distance-agnostic exceptions to the [[the_akidna_strategy_for_australias_defense | Akidna Strategy]]'s reliance on geography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:02">[01:39:02]</a>. However, there's currently little evidence that cyber warfare alone is militarily decisive, as demonstrated by the Ukraine war where physical explosives became the fallback when cyberattacks failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:09">[01:40:09]</a>.

### Challenges to Implementation

Implementing the [[the_akidna_strategy_for_australias_defense | Akidna Strategy]] faces significant hurdles:

*   **Political and Bureaucratic Inertia**: The US-Australia alliance is deeply embedded in the bureaucracies (e.g., Five Eyes, embedded personnel in Indo-Pacom) and the political culture of both major Australian parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Both Labour and Liberal parties claim parentage of the alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">[01:07:18]</a>. This makes fundamental reassessments difficult without a major external shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:38">[01:30:38]</a>.
*   **[[implications_of_the_aukus_agreement_on_nuclear_power | AUKUS]]**: The [[implications_of_the_aukus_agreement_on_nuclear_power | AUKUS]] agreement, while ambitious on an operational level, is seen as the "opposite of ambitious" for [[australias_defense_strategy_and_autonomy | Australia's place in the world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:10">[01:21:10]</a>. It is a "running home to mom" moment, signifying dependence rather than a confident, independent nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>. This commitment to acquiring nuclear-powered submarines is politically difficult to reverse due to the timing of major expenditures (5+ years away) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:52">[01:49:52]</a> and the deeply ingrained nature of the alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:47">[01:50:47]</a>.

## A New Narrative

While Australia has transformed its economy and foreign policy towards Asia through immigration and trade, defense policy, exemplified by [[implications_of_the_aukus_agreement_on_nuclear_power | AUKUS]], remains a "hold out" that goes against this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>. The "fear of abandonment" narrative that has historically defined [[australias_defense_strategy_and_autonomy | Australian defense and foreign policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a> is being challenged by the relative decline of American power in Asia and shocks like the Trump administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>. This may force Australia to become more "free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>.

The aspiration for Australia should be to become an "ambitious nation," not in terms of defense policy, but as a "beacon" of liberal democracy in a world increasingly moving towards illiberal forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. This includes building a much larger Australia in population and economic terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52">[01:22:52]</a>.

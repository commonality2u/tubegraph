## 2022 Lowy Institute Poll Findings

A 2022 poll conducted by the Lowy Institute indicated that approximately 36% of Australians either support or strongly support Australia [[australian_public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons_acquisition | acquiring nuclear weapons]] [00:00:00].

## Historical Context and Surprising Trends

The speaker expressed surprise at this particular [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons | public opinion on nuclear weapons]] result, especially when recalling the significant [[australias_historical_antinuclear_stance | anti-nuclear campaigns]] prevalent in Australia during the 1980s [00:00:09]. It was anticipated that these campaigns would intensify after the announcement of the [[implications_of_the_aukus_agreement_on_nuclear_power | AUKUS agreement]] [00:00:17], but a strong popular reaction did not occur [00:00:23].

Additionally, there has been no significant public opposition to the concept of Australia developing [[australia_and_nuclear_power | nuclear reactors]] [00:00:24]. This apparent shift suggested to the speaker that Australians might be more relaxed about [[australia_and_nuclear_power | nuclear power]] than previously assumed [00:00:32].

## Interpreting Poll Questions

It is important to note that poll questions, such as those asking if Australians want [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons | nuclear weapons]], are generally presented without counterfactuals [00:00:39]. This means respondents are not typically asked about the potential costs or trade-offs associated with such a decision [00:00:50].

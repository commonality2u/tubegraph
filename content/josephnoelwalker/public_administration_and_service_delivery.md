Public administration refers to the management of public programs and the provision of public goods and services. It is defined as the ability of governments at all levels to achieve their policy goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## [[australias_state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | Australia's Administrative State]]

Australia is often described as having a "talent for bureaucracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> and a high-functioning administrative state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This capacity was tested during the COVID-19 pandemic, where Australia's institutions were seen to serve the country well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. On most important measures, Australia outperformed the United States, including employment-to-population ratio recovery and lower deaths per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Australia has one of the highest levels of [[state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | state capacity]] in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Key indicators of Australia's public administration and service delivery efficiency include:
*   Approximately 98% of Medicare claims are processed electronically, amounting to about 1.1 million claims daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.
*   95% of individual tax lodgments are processed without human intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>.
*   The efficiency of Smart Gate at airports allows for rapid immigration clearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.
*   Public servants generally want to do the right thing and are socially minded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. In a crisis, there is a strong ability to draw on people's goodwill and willingness to go above and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>.
*   Australians have a high expectation for public services to "come out of the box and work," leading to political accountability if services fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:24">[01:13:24]</a>.

### Key Institutions and Their Roles

*   **Treasury, Finance, and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPM&C)**: These are the central agencies in Australia, often led by the most senior ministers (Prime Minister, Finance Minister, Treasurer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>. Their role is to act as "gatekeepers" of good policy, weeding out "insane ideas" from other departments or ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. Historically, Treasury's responsibilities have expanded beyond tax analysis to include climate modeling, evaluation, and costing opposition policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. This centralization of power within the Commonwealth is generally seen as beneficial for [[australias_state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | Australia's state capacity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.
*   **Australian Taxation Office (ATO)**: The ATO demonstrated significant mobilization during the pandemic, converting approximately a quarter of its staff to work on pandemic-related initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>.
*   **Department of Health**: The Health Department's handling of vaccine procurement during COVID-19 was criticized as a "disaster," due to a perceived lack of economic understanding and risk management in favor of medical advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This department is seen to have a "penny-pinching mindset" from normal operations, which was inappropriate for the high-stakes, high-cost-benefit analysis of a pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>.
*   **Local Health Districts**: During the pandemic, these demarcations were observed to make sense in organizing health responses in Sydney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:15">[01:32:15]</a>.
*   **Service NSW**: Exemplifies efficient service delivery, with quick and effective operations, despite high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:48">[01:13:48]</a>. Staff are generally well-paid and satisfied with their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

### Key Technologies

*   **Single Touch Payroll (STP)**: Introduced just before the pandemic (fully rolled out July 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>, this IT system automatically transmits payroll data (worker pay, tax withheld) to the ATO in real-time when a firm runs a pay run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. While initially for compliance, it proved critical for implementing JobKeeper by reducing fraud risk and enabling high integrity in fund delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>. The ATO's adaptable approach, working with software providers, was crucial to its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.
*   **Electronic GST Turnover Reporting**: Suggested as the next logical step in digitizing tax administration, similar to Chile's system where every transaction is electronically reported to the tax authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>. This could significantly reduce tax evasion and lower compliance costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.
*   **Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)**: Considered a highly ambitious next step for digital infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>. A centralized ledger run by a central bank could enable seamless, instantaneous, and cheap money transfers and smart contracts, potentially influencing the global financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>.

## Challenges and Areas for Improvement

Despite its strengths, Australia's public administration faces challenges:

*   **Department of Health's Performance**: The Health Department's handling of vaccine procurement and other public health policies (e.g., vaping) has been heavily criticized for a narrow focus and a lack of economic principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:02">[01:28:02]</a>.
*   **Fiscal Federalism**: The division of powers and funding between Commonwealth and states is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
    *   **GST Distribution**: The current GST distribution formula, designed for horizontal fiscal equalization, results in states having little accountability for how federal grants are spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>. A proposed reform would broaden the GST base, raise the rate, and eliminate conditional grants, giving states more autonomy over their spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>.
    *   **Housing Crisis**: The federal government's attempts to coerce states and local councils to liberalize housing supply are complex due to misaligned incentives and local political resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>.
*   **"Grift Nation"**: Australia has a significant amount of "grift" built into its economy, with businesses and individuals exploiting government subsidies and loopholes (e.g., NDIS services, vehicle tax deductions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:14">[01:46:14]</a>. This creates political constituencies that are difficult to reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:54">[01:46:54]</a>.
*   **Policymaking Quality**: There is concern that the quality of Australian policy has eroded over several decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:25">[01:37:25]</a>. This is partly due to a refusal by politicians to discuss trade-offs and a tendency to imply that citizens can "have everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:13">[01:38:13]</a>.
*   **Unemployment Insurance System**: Australia's unemployment insurance system is globally unique for its flat, indefinite payment, with no relation to prior earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. It is criticized as being too low to live on, but its indefinite nature is considered an important part of the social contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>. Calls exist to redesign it to be proportional to prior wages, time-limited, and triggered by economic circumstances for recession readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>.
*   **Public Transport**: While some improvements like the Sydney Metro are noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>, public transport is generally cited as an area needing improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>.
*   **Education System**: The public education system, particularly at primary and secondary levels, is seen as needing improvement, with calls for more school choice and competition, drawing lessons from the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>.

## Lessons from International Comparisons

*   **United States**:
    *   **Democratic Experimentalism**: The US system, with its 50 states, offers more "laboratories of democracy" for policy experimentation compared to Australia's fewer jurisdictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
    *   **Political Frictions**: The US system is deliberately designed to prevent legislation passage, leading to high frictions in funding programs and a degraded public service experience (e.g., long waits at the DMV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>.
    *   **Wealthy Opt-Out**: In the US, wealthy individuals often opt out of public services (e.g., private flights, private security), reducing political pressure for improved public service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. This contrasts with Australia's integrated systems (e.g., Medicare), where everyone, including the wealthy, has a stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.
    *   **Healthcare System**: While the Australian public healthcare system is sometimes criticized for being like a "cattle station," the US private system offers "Rolls Royce service" but at a cost that makes it inaccessible to the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:47">[01:24:47]</a>. The challenge is to inject the benefits of competition and choice without losing the safety net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a>.
*   **Chile**: Chile has a highly advanced and effective GST system where every transaction is electronically reported to the tax authority, leading to perfect compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>. This contrasts with Australia's paper-based GST reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

## Preparing for Future Crises

To improve [[challenges_of_policy_innovation_and_implementation | policy innovation and implementation]] and crisis management, Australia should consider:
*   **Honesty and Transparency**: Be honest about what is known and unknown during a crisis to maintain public credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.
*   **Flexibility in Thinking**: Avoid fighting "the last war" by applying old solutions to new crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
*   **Maintain Optionality**: Keep options open and avoid premature commitments, as seen in the vaccine procurement strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.
*   **Strategic Spending**: Be willing to spend necessary funds in a crisis, understanding that the costs of inaction (e.g., unemployment) far outweigh the costs of spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.
*   **Shovel-Ready Infrastructure**: Develop a pipeline of well-thought-out, immediately implementable infrastructure projects to stimulate the economy during recessions, focusing on quick-impact initiatives rather than long-lag mega-projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>.
*   **Quarantine Infrastructure**: Build dedicated quarantine facilities to avoid relying on hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:25">[01:49:25]</a>.
*   **Sovereign Manufacturing Capability**: Continue developing domestic mRNA manufacturing capacity for future pandemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:55">[01:49:55]</a>.

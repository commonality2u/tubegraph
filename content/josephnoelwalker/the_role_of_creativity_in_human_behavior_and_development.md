Creativity is a fundamental aspect of human behavior and development, enabling individuals to solve novel problems and drive progress. It is not merely an optional extra but a core determinant of how people interact with and shape their world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>.

## Defining Creativity

Creativity allows individuals and systems to generate unforeseen knowledge and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. A truly creative system or individual must be able to change its own values or goals, as holding onto predetermined objectives can lead to dead ends when exploring possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

## Creativity vs. Genes and Environment

While some might argue that all behavior is either genetically controlled or socially constructed, an alternative view posits that creativity is a primary determinant of human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>.

Genetic and cultural factors can influence creativity, but they don't necessarily determine it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>. For example, an individual's innate abilities (like visual-spatial hardware or physical attributes) might incline them towards certain activities, making them seem "genetically suitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>. However, people can also dedicate their creativity to compensating for perceived genetic "unsuitability," sometimes becoming even better than those with natural predispositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>. An example is Michael Chang, a tennis player who achieved great success despite being shorter than the average player at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>.

The concept of heritability, which measures the extent to which differences in a sample of people can be attributed to genetic differences, is a statistical measure of individual variation within a population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:56">[01:12:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>. Even identical twins raised together are not indistinguishable, meaning that factors beyond genes and easily measurable environmental influences contribute to their differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34">[01:21:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:49">[01:21:49]</a>. This "non-shared" environment may include random developmental processes or the open-ended, combinatorial nature of [[continuous_improvement_in_decision_making | cognitive processes]], where small initial differences can lead to divergent outcomes through creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:10">[01:23:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:55">[01:23:55]</a>.

When the environment suppresses creativity, behavior might appear to be entirely determined by genes and environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. However, if people are allowed to be more creative, their unique contributions become more apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:45">[01:19:45]</a>.

## Creativity in Human Development and Learning

Children demonstrate remarkable creativity in learning, particularly in language acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>. Unlike large language models that rely on statistical patterns from vast amounts of text, children engage in active explanation-formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. They possess a core understanding of basic ontological categories, such as agents, objects, and living things, and they correlate the sounds people make with likely intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>. This ability to form explanations, even from an early age, is why children can learn to speak in just three years, a feat that would take current AI models tens of thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>.

## Creativity and Progress

Creativity is essential for progress because it allows for the generation of solutions to problems that were previously unforeseeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. When fundamental discoveries are made, they not only solve existing problems (picking "low hanging fruit") but also create entirely new fields and problems, essentially growing "new fruit trees" for further exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:11">[01:39:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.

Societies must foster creativity, which can be challenging to accommodate within stable structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. The [[cultural_evolution_and_its_significance | Enlightenment]] provided a framework for doing so through "traditions of criticism," which, despite sounding contradictory, allow for change and progress within a stable society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.

## Suppression of Creativity

There are concerns that scientific and technological progress has slowed since the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:14">[01:36:14]</a>. This slowdown is often attributed to both the "picking of low-hanging fruit" (meaning ideas are harder to find) and various cultural factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:23">[01:36:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:30">[01:36:30]</a>. Cultural factors contributing to this include:
*   Bureaucracy within academia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:34">[01:36:34]</a>.
*   Increased risk aversion in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:39">[01:36:39]</a>.
*   A retreat from meritocracy, watering down commitments to scientific and mathematical excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.
*   Instrumentalism and overspecialization in scientific research, which directs efforts towards incremental solutions rather than fundamental discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:11">[01:41:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:11">[01:42:11]</a>.
*   Irrational trends within universities, even in STEM fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:46">[01:43:46]</a>.
*   A rejection of the [[role_of_philosophy_in_understanding_modern_issues | Enlightenment]] idea that the search for truth is desirable, leading to a diversion towards goals other than truth and deep explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:20">[01:45:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:07">[01:46:07]</a>.

The belief that ideas are getting harder to find is countered by the argument that fundamental discoveries continuously open up new avenues for research and new problems to solve, creating "new fruit trees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:22">[01:39:22]</a>. The fact that humanity doesn't always take advantage of these new opportunities requires explanation, as there are always smart young people eager to understand the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:46">[01:44:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:54">[01:44:54]</a>. If these individuals are diverted from fundamental research, it indicates a malign influence or systemic issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:16">[01:45:16]</a>.

Australia's immigration policy, particularly a series of regulatory changes introduced by the Howard government in [[australian_immigration_policy_changes_in_2001 | 2001]], has profoundly shaped its economy and demography in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. These changes significantly increased immigration intake to levels not seen since the post-World War II "populate or perish" era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Evolution of Immigration Policy and Intake

The 2001 policy sought to maintain the skill level of migrants despite a shallow pool of applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The innovative solution was to massively expand the intake of [[role_of_international_students_in_australian_immigration | international students]] and working holiday makers, with the idea that these individuals could upskill in Australia and then apply for permanent residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This strategy proved successful, with over 2 million [[role_of_international_students_in_australian_immigration | international students]] and working holiday makers arriving in the subsequent two decades, many settling permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. In recent years, [[role_of_international_students_in_australian_immigration | international students]] have accounted for over 40% of annual net migration, making decisions about them central to Australia's immigration policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Australia is one of the most multicultural nations globally, with about 30% of its population born overseas, the highest rate in the developed world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This has contributed to Australia having one of the youngest and most multicultural populations among developed nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Government Control and Net Overseas Migration

A common misconception is that the government has day-to-day control over migration numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. While policy changes are made, their effects typically take one to five years to manifest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. For instance, the significant boom in net migration in recent years stemmed largely from policy decisions made during and before the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

The relevant metric for understanding population change is net overseas migration (NOM), defined as the number of people entering Australia for 12 out of 16 months minus those leaving for the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. NOM includes both the permanent migration program (which the government caps) and the demand-driven temporary program, which includes [[role_of_international_students_in_australian_immigration | international students]] and working holiday makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The temporary program often accounts for a larger portion of overall net migration, explaining why numbers can "blow out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Other groups contributing to NOM include New Zealand citizens moving in and out, and Australian citizens leaving or returning long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Economic and Demographic Objectives

The primary objective of Australia's immigration policy, particularly in its post-war inception, has been demographic â€“ to [[australian_immigration_policy_and_population_aging | slow the rate of population aging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. This objective was paramount (around 80%) in the transformative 2001 changes, alongside pressure from universities to expand international education for revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This combination proved attractive, contributing skills, export income, slowing aging, and offering a budget benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

Immigration contributes to [[economic benefits of immigration | economic prosperity]] as successful migrants often lead to job creation for native Australians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Impact on Population Aging

Australia's total fertility rate dropped below replacement level (around 2.1 children per woman) in 1976 and currently stands at about 1.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. Net migration, with its younger demographic skew, has been crucial in [[australian_immigration_policy and population aging | slowing population aging]] and contributing to births <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.

Without net migration, Australia's population would be significantly smaller (likely <10 million) and much older, with a median age around 47-48 (compared to the current 37-38) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Deaths would far outweigh births, leading to a shrinking population, resembling Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

If net migration were cut to zero tomorrow, Australia would experience natural decrease (deaths exceeding births) in about 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. However, if Australia maintains its current high levels of net migration (e.g., 200,000 per year) and the fertility rate stabilizes at 1.5, natural decrease might not begin until the end of the century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. Australia would be the last developed nation to reach this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.

It's important to note that immigration cannot reverse population aging, only [[australian_immigration_policy_and_population_aging | slow its rate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. Migrants themselves age, and there are diminishing returns to increasing net migration beyond a certain point in terms of slowing aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>. An optimum level for net migration, given Australia's current fertility rate, is estimated to be around 200,000 to 250,000 per year, which also tends to yield the best [[economic benefits of immigration | economic]] and budgetary outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>. Pushing net migration too high (e.g., above 300,000) risks losing public confidence in the government's control and raises concerns about infrastructure and service delivery capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>.

### Fertility Decline Drivers

The global decline in fertility since World War II is widely attributed by demographers to the accessibility and affordability of contraception and the increased education of girls, both of which took off in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>. Other factors include financial capacity, with childcare costs (after [[housing_affordability_crisis_in_australia | housing]]) being a significant challenge for young couples in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>, and women delaying the age of their first child for career, education, or financial reasons (e.g., needing a house) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:16">[01:38:16]</a>.

## Economic Impacts and Challenges

### Housing and International Students

Immigration contributes to the demand side of the [[the_relationship_between_immigration_housing_and_economic_growth | housing market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. [[role_of_international_students_in_australian_immigration | International students]] undoubtedly impact the [[housing_affordability_crisis_in_australia | housing market]], particularly near universities and in CBDs where they primarily live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. While they mostly rent or live in student accommodation, a small number may purchase homes after foreign investment review processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. However, many other factors contribute to the current [[housing_affordability_crisis_in_australia | housing crisis]], though immigrants are often an easy scapegoat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>.

### Wages and Employment

The impact of migrants on local wages is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. While parts of the labor market might experience oversupply and downward pressure on wages if more migrants enter those specific areas, sectors like aged care and healthcare currently face significant skill shortages, meaning migrants help fill vacancies rather than depress wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>.

High-skilled migration can be a good way to create jobs for low-skilled workers, as high-skilled migrants often require support staff to perform lesser-skilled work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>. Australia has introduced low-skill programs to fill jobs, but these have unfortunately led to "extraordinary levels of exploitation and abuse" of migrant workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>. Preventing exploitation requires giving more agency to individual migrants (e.g., easier employer mobility) and introducing genuine penalties for exploitative employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>.

## Social Cohesion and Acculturation

Australia is remarkably successful at multiculturalism, with 85% public support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. This success is largely attributed to historical bipartisan political support for a non-discriminatory immigration program and multicultural society since 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. While cultural assimilation evolves naturally through interaction, rather than through government dictate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>, the high-skilled nature of Australia's migrants, particularly [[role_of_international_students_in_australian_immigration | international students]] who spend formative years in Australian universities, may contribute to shared cultural beliefs and easier acculturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Directions

A significant challenge in Australia is the lack of robust, independent research on immigration policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. Funding for immigration research has decreased since the integration of the Immigration Department into Home Affairs, with focus shifting to law enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>. This leaves Australia ill-equipped to address future immigration policy debates with up-to-date research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>.

A key recommendation for the future is for the Prime Minister to commit to developing a genuine [[Population Growth and Sustainable Development in Australia | national population plan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. Such a plan would comprehensively address future population projections, which has historically been absent from governmental "population plans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>.

Regarding permanent skilled migration, the most effective categories are employer-sponsored, where employers choose based on business fit, and state/regional sponsored categories, which address specific local needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a>. The points-tested category, while often lauded, is primarily dependent on the pass mark set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>.

In terms of specific policy improvements, a standardized entrance exam for [[role_of_international_students_in_australian_immigration | overseas students]] would be more efficient, objective, and fair than the current "genuine student" criterion, which relies on subjective visa decision-making and leads to uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:37">[01:31:37]</a>. This would also provide the government with a more sensible way to control student numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:10">[01:36:10]</a>.

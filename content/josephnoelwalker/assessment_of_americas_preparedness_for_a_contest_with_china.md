The United States currently lacks the comprehensive national commitment and widespread public engagement necessary to effectively confront the rise of China as a great power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite the significant nature of the challenge, the necessary "whole of nation" effort has not yet materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Lack of National Mission and Public Engagement

Since China's ascent in the post-Cold War era, no American president has declared the [[americas_national_mission_regarding_chinas_rise | challenge posed by China]] as a national mission requiring the devotion of the entire country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A sustained, whole-of-nation effort, which is deemed essential, cannot be undertaken quietly or solely within the "Beltway" (Washington D.C. political circles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. It would require the President to rally the public, a step that has not yet been taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Scale of the Challenge

The current [[us_china_economic_and_military_power_dynamics | economic challenge]] from China is unprecedented. No other power has ever approached 60% of American GDP, a figure China has surpassed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This makes China a significantly larger economic challenge than the [[comparison_of_chinas_challenge_to_historical_threats_like_cold_war_and_world_war_ii | Cold War]] in most respects, and economically greater than Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Intellectual and Popular Cultural Preparedness

The intellectual environment and popular culture in the U.S. do not indicate that the nation is primed for a contest of this magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Limited Public Discourse

While there is extensive discussion among American scholars, think tank experts, political advisors, and military analysts who write books and articles on the "China Challenge" or "China Threat" within journals like *Foreign Affairs* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, this discourse largely remains confined to the "Beltway crowd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. There is a noticeable [[lack_of_intellectual_and_popular_cultural_engagement_with_chinas_challenge | absence of broader intellectual and popular cultural engagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. For instance, popular commentators like Joe Rogan are not preoccupied with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, nor are prominent public intellectuals like David Brooks or Ross Douthat writing extensively on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This suggests that the [[role_of_american_intellectuals_and_media_in_addressing_the_china_challenge | intellectual heft and media attention]] required to galvanize the nation for a sustained competition is not present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Contrast with Past Challenges

This situation contrasts sharply with historical periods of significant national challenge:
*   **[[comparison_of_chinas_challenge_to_historical_threats_like_cold_war_and_world_war_ii | Cold War]]**: The Cold War fostered an entire school of thought known as Cold War liberalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **War on Terrorism**: The War on Terrorism saw figures like Andrew Sullivan, Christopher Hitchens, Paul Berman, Michael Ignatieff, and *The New York Times* editorial page deeply engaged with questions of maintaining liberal democracy against the radical Islamist threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Currently, there is no similar "intellectual ferment" in the United States to support the scale of the challenge that America's governing class claims to be undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

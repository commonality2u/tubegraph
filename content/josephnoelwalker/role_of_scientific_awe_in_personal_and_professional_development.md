Scientific awe, described as an intense feeling of absorption and wonder, plays a significant role in both the [[personal_happiness_and_scientific_discovery | personal happiness and scientific discovery]] of individuals like Laura Deming, as well as their professional development in scientific fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.

## The Nature of Scientific Awe

Laura Deming describes scientific awe as an intense absorption into a scientific question, where she feels she can "see the universe" or "see... God" and be "one with the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>. This state is distinct from feelings of calm or peace experienced during meditation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. It's characterized by a sense of connecting with the "laws of the universe that are real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. Deming likens it to descriptions of intense religious experiences, but triggered by engagement with a physics textbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

While some individuals experience scientific awe infrequently, like a seasonal change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>, Deming actively optimizes her life to enter this state, viewing it as a "hedonistic" pursuit that she values for its own sake rather than for functional reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. She has tracked spending 512 hours in this state since 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.

## Cultivating Scientific Awe

Deming has developed specific practices to help induce this state:
*   Being in a "grassy open environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.
*   Having music playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.
*   Having recently eaten sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.
*   Engaging with a set of "mental objects" that are sufficiently developed to be interactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.
    *   [[cell_biology | Cell biology]] is particularly effective for this, as it allows for an "embodied thinking" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
    *   This involves imagining oneself inside a cell and interacting with its laws and properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.
    *   The "powers of 10" exercise, which involves mentally scaling down from one's arm to an atom, can help conceptualize logarithmic scales and interconnectedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

This approach builds on a historical tradition, as seen in Albert Einstein's early education, where teachers encouraged visceral, intuitive engagement with concepts, like holding apples to understand quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>.

## Impact on Scientific Discovery and Professional Development

While not a prerequisite for all great scientists, scientific awe has been beneficial for Deming's professional development:
*   **Motivation and Perseverance**: The pleasant nature of this emotion can indirectly help maintain motivation for challenging, long-term projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Creativity and Insights**: Deming states that experiencing this state has helped her achieve "counterfactual scientific insights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.
    *   **Cryopreservation Example**: Her "thought experiments" within the cell, using embodied thinking, significantly aided her understanding of cryopreservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. She realized the strangeness of cryopreservation's possibility due to cells' reliance on passive diffusion and their invariance to molecular randomization, unlike human-designed systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>.
*   **Field Amenability**: Fields like [[cell_biology | biology]] and physics are particularly amenable to this mode of embodied thinking, as they involve phenomena that can be intuitively "simulated" or "rendered" in the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. Mathematics, with its abstract objects, is less so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.

## Scientific Awe and Personal Development

The pursuit of scientific awe is a form of personal development in itself for Deming. Her dedication to cultivating this state highlights its deep personal value, suggesting that for some, the experience of profound intellectual and spiritual connection through scientific understanding is a primary driver of [[personal_happiness_and_scientific_discovery | personal happiness and scientific discovery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. It reflects a personal journey towards finding truth and meaning within the framework of scientific principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.

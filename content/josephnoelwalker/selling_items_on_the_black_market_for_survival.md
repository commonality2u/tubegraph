## Background: Leaving Communist Hungary

In 1985, an individual faced the challenge of leaving Communist Hungary after being asked to depart from an institute with only six months to find another job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This situation underscored the importance of not taking setbacks personally, but rather focusing on the next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The move to America was not easy due to the strict communist regime in Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

To prevent defection, the government severely restricted the amount of money families could take out of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. For a family of three – a husband, a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter, and the individual – they were only allowed to take $50 for the daughter and $50 for the husband, with the individual being told to ask their employer for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This $100 total was intended to limit movement and make survival in America difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## The Black Market Transaction

To secure more funds for their new life, the family sold their Russian car (Lada) on the black market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. While the car could be sold officially, the black market was necessary to exchange the Hungarian currency into foreign currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This exchange was facilitated by students from Arabic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The individual exchanged Hungarian currency for British pounds, as dollars were not available from the buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This transaction yielded approximately $800, which was equivalent to $1,200 at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Obtaining foreign currency through official channels was impossible; the Hungarian currency was not convertible, and any foreign currency received had to be surrendered to the bank in exchange for local currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Possessing foreign currency was against the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Although the black market transaction was illegal, it was deemed necessary for the family to be able to leave the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

The $1,200 obtained through the black market was a substantial sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. To [[smuggling_money_to_america | smuggle]] this money out of Hungary, it was hidden inside the daughter Susan's teddy bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The money was wrapped up, stitched into the teddy bears, and closely watched at the airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The two-and-a-half-year-old daughter was too young to be aware of the money's presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Many other Hungarians also resorted to similar methods to bring extra money out of the country, recognizing that $100 was insufficient to begin a new life in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

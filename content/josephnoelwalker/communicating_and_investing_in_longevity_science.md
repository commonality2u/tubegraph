Laura Deming, co-founder and CEO of Cradle, is a venture capitalist focused on [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | anti-aging and life extension technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. She founded the Longevity Fund, which has since been superseded by a new fund called Age One, where she is a co-founder and partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Investing in Longevity Science

The way people think about [[philosophical_implications_of_longevity | philosophical and sociopolitical implications of longevity]] currently influences how capital flows in a subconscious way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Underlying beliefs guide intuitions about what is correct to invest in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, and these investments then determine what technologies might be most available in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. In Silicon Valley, the prevailing view for investment tends to be a conservative perspective focused on preserving the physical self for as long as possible with physical continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

A concern with extended [[The value of life and existential risk | longevity]] is the potential for increased inequality, where early generations with capital gain an "insane advantage" from living longer and compounding capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. However, this might be mitigated by the necessity of innovation and the potential for wealth taxation over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

The Longevity Fund, established in 2013, initially invested in companies that appeared like normal biotech firms but had a strong link to [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | aging biology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. This approach aimed to provide the field with examples of companies that biotech investors could understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>. Over time, it became clear that the most successful companies in their portfolio were founder-oriented, pursuing "moonshot ideas," and engaged with at early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.

### Regulatory Bottlenecks in Longevity Drugs

To reduce regulatory bottlenecks for [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | longevity drugs]], key steps would include:
*   Laying the groundwork for "aging" as a recognized indication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>.
*   Shortening review cycle timelines for preclinical companies from six months to ideally a couple of weeks, while maintaining safety and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>. The uncertainty of long review cycles is a major contributor to timeline uncertainty for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

## Communicating Longevity Science

A significant challenge in the [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_modern_technological_innovation | longevity field]] is the "mental blocker" many people have against engaging with the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. There is a valid wisdom in *not* thinking about the problem of [[The value of life and existential risk | longevity]], as it can cause "extreme mental anguish" if one doesn't accept certain things in life that feel both horrific and inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. It's important to be respectful of someone's metaphysical comfort when discussing [[The value of life and existential risk | longevity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

While some individuals feel it is factually incorrect not to work on [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | longevity drugs]] (viewing them as a type of medicine, similar to exercise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, there's a deep wisdom that often drives opposition to the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Transhumanism and Public Perception

Current [[Transhumanism and personal identity | transhumanist manifestos]] often focus on "gaining power" and a "drive to survive," which feels incomplete and uninspiring to some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. There's a perceived overconfidence in the types of technologies and changes possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>. Instead of focusing on individuals changing in predictable ways, a more "humane transhumanism" could be oriented towards populations changing in unpredictable ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>. Many sci-fi authors intentionally avoid writing futures that are too different from our own to maintain relatability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>.

One concern raised by Francis Fukuyama is that massively extended lifespans could lead to a less dynamic society, as people's worldviews are shaped by youth experiences, potentially leading to less turnover in positions and a society less open to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. However, it's argued that even today, culture shifts and new styles replace old ones, regardless of individual longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.

### Communicating [[Cryopreservation and its applications | Cryopreservation]]

[[Cryopreservation and its applications | Cryopreservation]] faces unique challenges in public communication due to its "weirdness" and existing "baggage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:44">[01:12:44]</a>. It runs counter to many intuitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:28">[01:16:28]</a>. The concept of "cold" being inherently unpleasant also contributes to a general dislike of the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>.

Despite the public perception challenges, [[Cryopreservation and its applications | cryopreservation]] (specifically reversible whole-body cryopreservation) is seen as:
*   **Impactful:** Potentially allows individuals to bridge the gap to future therapies for terminal illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>. It offers access to future medicine, even if it only provides a normal lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:36">[01:11:36]</a>.
*   **Leveraged:** Solving this one problem completely could grant access to many other future possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>.
*   **Technically Tractable:** While experimental, it allows for deep integration of engineering and physics, enabling rapid development of new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.
*   **Underworked On:** Compared to its potential, very few companies are seriously working on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>.
*   **More Straightforward:** As a single problem, it is more fully defined and offers more opportunities to apply physics and engineering tools with leverage compared to the broader field of [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | longevity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:44">[01:13:44]</a>.

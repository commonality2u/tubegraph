Venture Capitalists (VCs) in India often misperceive the risks associated with product development, particularly when comparing software and hardware solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This misjudgment leads them to overlook significant opportunities in the hardware space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Public Goods and Private Sector Context

In the United States, public goods like clean water, sidewalks, law enforcement, and air pollution mitigation are largely taken for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The private sector primarily focuses on supplying other necessities, especially within the digital space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

In contrast, the private sector in India often needs to develop fundamental hardware design solutions that are considered basic infrastructure in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These essential hardware solutions often fail to attract funding from VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Software vs. Hardware: A Mismatched Risk Assessment

VCs' risk assessment differs significantly between software and hardware ventures, primarily due to their strong focus on digital goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Software Development

Software ventures are typically perceived as having virtually no [[market_risk_versus_product_risk_in_india | product risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Solutions can be developed by a few young developers in a short period, leading to the primary concern being [[market_risk_versus_product_risk_in_india | market risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. VCs typically focus on "product to market fit" for software, which has been a successful approach for them globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Hardware Development

For hardware, VCs tend to believe there is both [[market_risk_versus_product_risk_in_india | product risk]] and [[market_risk_versus_product_risk_in_india | market risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. However, there is often very little [[market_risk_versus_product_risk_in_india | market risk]] for essential hardware solutions in India (e.g., air pollution devices, which are advertised widely) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The significant challenge lies in the high [[market_risk_versus_product_risk_in_india | product risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. VCs, being "plugged into digital goods," struggle to understand and assess the [[market_risk_versus_product_risk_in_india | product risk]] associated with physical manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This creates a mismatch, as they primarily fund ventures where they perceive no real [[market_risk_versus_product_risk_in_india | product risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Indian VCs and Angel Investors

Indian VCs often mimic the investment strategies of American VCs, also failing to capitalize on hardware opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

In contrast, [[angel_investors_versus_venture_capitalists_in_india | angel investors in India]] are more inclined to fund these hardware solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. They have prior experience in building such products and possess the expertise to "de-risk product development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This indicates that while VCs are focused on market risk, [[angel_investors_versus_venture_capitalists_in_india | angels]] are more attuned to and capable of managing [[market_risk_versus_product_risk_in_india | product risk]] in the Indian context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The prevailing VC influence of focusing only on [[market_risk_versus_product_risk_in_india | market risk]] may not be suitable for the Indian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

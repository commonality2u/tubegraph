Early in the process of selecting "[[talent_scouting_in_india | India]] winners," a key figure asked a unique question: given that all selected candidates were succeeding, "Are you taking enough [[risk_assessment_in_talent_selection | risk]] where's the [[evaluating_success_and_failure_rates | failure rate]]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> This query was unusual, as success typically prompts leaving things undisturbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Process of Rejection Analysis

In response, an in-depth analysis was conducted on all individuals who were *not* awarded grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The objective was to determine if rejections were due to projects being excessively [[risk_assessment_in_talent_selection | risky]] or "out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Findings from the Analysis

The assessment revealed that none of the rejections were primarily because a project was too [[risk_assessment_in_talent_selection | risky]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Instead, rejections stemmed from two main issues:
*   The person not having a sufficiently fleshed-out idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   The project not being [[risk_assessment_in_talent_selection | risky]] enough, often described as "cookie cutter" or "boring," prompting questions about its necessity in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Following this review, comfort was expressed with the level of [[risk_assessment_in_talent_selection | risk]] being undertaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Recommendation for Talent Scouts

It is highly recommended for any new [[talent_scouting_in_india | talent scout]] to consistently perform this rejection analysis every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This ongoing practice involves reviewing past rejections and re-evaluating whether the initial decision was correct, and if that perspective still holds true after further experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

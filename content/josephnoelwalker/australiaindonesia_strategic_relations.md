Australia's top priority for statecraft should be an alliance with Indonesia, even if it is not formalized [01:12:25 | 01:12:28]. This is crucial given Indonesia's projected rise as a major power [01:42:51 | 01:43:04].

## The Imperative for an Alliance

While Australia is geographically distant from [[uschina_relations_and_strategic_dominance_in_asia | China]], benefiting from distance as its single biggest defense asset [01:41:50 | 01:42:00], this advantage does not extend to Indonesia [01:42:01 | 01:42:03]. Historically, Australia has benefited from Indonesia being relatively poor and primarily a land power, but this cannot be relied upon indefinitely [01:42:13 | 01:42:22].

Indonesia is expected to become much wealthier, with a respectable case that it will be considered a great power by the middle of this century, comparable to Japan, India, France, and Britain in economic and potentially strategic weight [01:42:25 | 01:42:48]. Indonesia is also the natural leader in Southeast Asia [01:42:51 | 01:42:53].

Currently, there is no resident great power in Southeast Asia, making it a natural outlet for Chinese ambition, unlike other parts of Asia where great powers would frustrate such ambitions [01:42:56 | 01:43:19]. Therefore, it is strongly in Australia's interest for Indonesia to assume that leadership role [01:43:22 | 01:43:25]. It is also critical for Australia to be on Indonesia's side when it becomes a great power [01:43:34 | 01:43:38].

A wealthy and hostile Indonesia would be the "worst outcome" for Australia [01:43:52 | 01:43:56], potentially making Australia one of the least secure countries in the world, facing a major security threat close to its shores, similar to South Korea, Israel, or Poland [01:44:00 | 01:44:26]. Thus, ensuring this scenario never happens is a massive priority [01:44:27 | 01:44:32].

## Nature of the Proposed Alliance

The proposed alliance with Indonesia should be based on purely and narrowly defensive ambitions that are solely maritime [01:47:03 | 01:47:13]. It should not involve "power projection" in the sense of forces that can range thousands of kilometers onto an adversary's landmass [01:47:17 | 01:47:37]. The alliance would be explicitly based on the premise that there would be no capability to project power onto the landmass of any country, including [[uschina_relations_and_strategic_dominance_in_asia | China]] or any Chinese base in the region [01:47:50 | 01:48:04].

The goal is to communicate to potential adversaries that the intent is only defensive, used only in extreme circumstances and if attacked [01:48:37 | 01:48:44]. This aligns with the [[the_akidna_strategy_for_australia | akidna strategy]] motif: "Akidnas are benign creatures. They can't hurt you unless you come at them" [01:48:46 | 01:48:56].

## Challenges to Alliance Formation

Despite Australia's readiness for closer ties at the elite level [01:52:37 | 01:52:43], several challenges exist, mainly on the Indonesian side [01:52:33 | 01:52:34]:
*   **Indonesian Strategic Community:** It is very small, potentially lacking the imagination to consider such an alliance [01:52:46 | 01:52:53].
*   **Indonesian Focus:** When considering its security, Indonesia primarily looks north, as Australia is not perceived as a problem [01:52:58 | 01:53:05]. There may not be the "bandwidth" to consider Australia in such grand terms [01:53:08 | 01:53:11].
*   **Australian Cultural Mindset:** Some argue Australia's Southeast Asia literacy is poor, and it behaves like a "white postcolonial power," not yet mentally ready to view Indonesia as a great power to which Australia might be subordinate [01:51:39 | 01:52:27].
*   **Impact of AUKUS:** The [[impact_of_aukus_on_australias_stance_towards_nuclear_power | AUKUS]] arrangement and Australia's relationship with the United States could hinder such a partnership. If the alliance with the United States becomes even closer, Indonesians may not be enthusiastic about a quasi-alliance with Australia [01:53:24 | 01:53:52].

Indonesia's strategic identity remains undefined post-Cold War; it is still "non-aligned," a position conceived during the Cold War [01:49:19 | 01:49:33]. While it behaves somewhat as ASEAN's natural leader, it has not actively sought to grasp leadership, and none of its democratic-era presidents have defined Indonesia as the region's great power [01:49:37 | 01:49:58]. However, if [[uschina_relations_and_strategic_dominance_in_asia | China's]] ambitions are as great as suspected, they will likely clash with Indonesia's interests, forcing hard choices upon Indonesia [01:50:53 | 01:51:06].

## Window of Opportunity

Currently, Australia possesses military capabilities and a technological edge over Indonesia, which spends less than 1% of its GDP on defense [01:53:58 | 01:54:10]. Indonesia could significantly transform its defense forces by raising spending to a modest 2% of GDP, similar to Australia's current spend [01:54:10 | 01:54:16].

However, the window of opportunity for Australia to offer valuable military capabilities to Indonesia may be longer than 10-15 years [01:54:35 | 01:54:42]. This is because [[australias_state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | Indonesian state capacity]] is still very low across various sectors, including taxation, education, health, and infrastructure [01:54:48 | 01:55:16]. While there's steady improvement, it's still below Thailand or Malaysia [01:55:16 | 01:55:31].

In the defense realm, recent procurement projects have been "weird," such as acquiring fighter aircraft from three different countries in small batches [01:55:34 | 01:55:58]. Indonesia also recently lost a submarine with all crew aboard [01:56:06 | 01:56:12]. Traditionally, the Indonesian military (TNI) has been internally focused on security [01:56:17 | 01:56:23]. While there are pockets of improvement, progress towards a more traditional Western-style military is very early and halting [01:56:23 | 01:56:38].

A more substantial economic relationship between Australia and Indonesia would be beneficial [01:47:02 | 01:47:11], but economists note a lack of obvious complementarities as both are large resource exporters [01:47:28 | 01:47:36]. Furthermore, Australia faces behind-the-border trade restrictions, corruption, and red tape in Indonesia [01:47:40 | 01:47:48]. In the absence of strong economic ties, immigration could serve as a starting place to deepen the relationship [01:48:10 | 01:48:22]. Australia has historically used immigration as a tool of foreign policy and could open special visa categories to encourage an Indonesian diaspora, which is currently "puzzlingly anemic" compared to other Southeast Asian populations in Australia [01:48:48 | 01:49:00].

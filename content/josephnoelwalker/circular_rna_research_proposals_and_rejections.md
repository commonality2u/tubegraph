Early career efforts at the University of Pennsylvania involved consistent pursuit of research funding, with monthly grant applications submitted from 1989 in an attempt to establish a research laboratory for a non-tenure research assistant professor position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite these efforts, none of the initial proposals were funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This period highlights the [[challenges_of_securing_research_grants | challenges of securing research grants]] faced early in a scientific career.

## Proposals for Circular RNA

One specific area of proposed research involved the use of circular RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Although circular RNA is now considered a novel area of research, proposals on this topic were already being submitted and rejected as early as 1992 or 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The grants proposing circular RNA research were unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Reasons for Rejection

The feedback on these rejected proposals often highlighted several issues:
*   **Perceived Instability** The RNA was criticized as being "labile," suggesting it would not be useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This points to [[challenges_in_obtaining_research_funding_for_rna_work | challenges in obtaining research funding for RNA work]] due to perceptions of RNA stability.
*   **Insufficient Data** There was a consistent critique that not enough data was presented to support the proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Despite extensive [[katalin_karikos_laboratory_work_and_experiments | laboratory work and experiments]] to generate more data, it was deemed insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Questioned Knowledge** Reviewers sometimes questioned the proposer's knowledge to conduct the proposed experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Approach to Rejection and Improvement

In response to rejections, a constructive approach was taken. Rather than concluding that reviewers lacked understanding, the focus was on self-improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This involved:
*   **Listening to Feedback** Actively listening to the criticisms and understanding what could be improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Improving Grant Writing** Enhancing the clarity and persuasiveness of grant proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Peer Review** Seeking feedback from colleagues on proposal drafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Generating More Data** Conducting further experiments to strengthen the empirical basis of the proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
This iterative process demonstrates a form of [[rejection_analysis_in_talent_scouting | rejection analysis]] applied to scientific grant applications.

## Demotion from Faculty

Despite continuous efforts and improvements, the lack of success in securing funding led to significant professional consequences. The University of Pennsylvania had a policy requiring faculty members to establish themselves by securing funding within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Failure to do so resulted in promotion or removal from the faculty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This policy ultimately led to removal from the faculty in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

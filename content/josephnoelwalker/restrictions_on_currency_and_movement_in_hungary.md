In 1985, during the period of [[challenges_of_immigrating_from_communist_hungary | communist Hungary]], the government implemented strict controls on both the movement of its citizens and the use of foreign currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. These measures were intended to limit defection and control financial flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Limitations on Emigration

When a family sought to emigrate, authorities placed significant restrictions on the amount of money they could take out of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. For instance, a family consisting of two adults and a two-and-a-half-year-old child was only officially permitted to take $100 in total: $50 for the daughter and $50 for the husband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The wife was advised to ask her employer for additional funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This meager allowance was considered an attempt by the authorities to deter emigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Currency Restrictions

Hungarian currency was not freely convertible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Citizens could not simply exchange Hungarian currency for foreign currency like dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Furthermore, it was illegal for individuals to possess foreign currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. If someone received foreign currency, they were required to deposit it at a bank and would receive Hungarian currency in exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Circumventing Restrictions

Due to the severe limitations, many Hungarians found ways to obtain and transport extra money when emigrating, as $100 was insufficient to live in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

One method involved selling personal assets on the black market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. For example, a Russian car could be sold officially, but the proceeds would then be exchanged for foreign currency on the black market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This was often done with students from Arabic countries who had access to foreign currency like pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Amounts equivalent to $800 to $1,200 could be obtained this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

The challenge then became how to transport this illegally obtained foreign currency out of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. A common method for [[smuggling_money_to_america | smuggling]] money was to hide it within children's toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Money could be wrapped and stitched into a teddy bear, with emigrants carefully watching the bear at the airport to ensure it wasn't left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Children, such as a two-and-a-half-year-old, were typically unaware of the money hidden in their toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This practice was widespread among Hungarians seeking to emigrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

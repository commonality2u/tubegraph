Traditionally, there are no legal limitations on moving within a country, allowing individuals from areas like rural Mississippi to relocate to places such as the Bay Area without requiring permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This internal mobility was very common in the United States and other countries, particularly from "backwards" low-wage areas to more advanced regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Drivers of Historical Internal Migration

The primary reason people moved from one area to another was to obtain higher pay, which was a direct result of higher productivity in the destination area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. Higher productivity could stem from factors such as advanced technology, better management practices, or more fertile land for agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

Historically, both low and high-skilled workers moved out of low-wage areas, particularly from the US South, into higher-wage regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. A notable example is the significant migration to California during the 1940s, 50s, 60s, and 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. While narratives like "The Grapes of Wrath" might suggest these moves were disastrous, for most individuals, they were successful, leading to higher-paying jobs and improved living conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

## Shifts in Modern US Internal Migration

In the modern US, a peculiar trend has emerged: despite continued large gaps in measured productivity between regions, internal mobility has significantly decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Research by economists Ganong and Shoag indicates that while high-skilled individuals still move from low to high-productivity areas, low-skilled workers are moving in the reverse direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. For instance, low-skilled workers are leaving San Francisco, where wages are higher, for places in Texas where wages are lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. This phenomenon highlights a significant shift in [[regional_economic_mobility_in_america | regional economic mobility in America]] compared to previous [[historical_and_potential_future_population_density_and_urbanization_trends | historical and potential future population density and urbanization trends]]

### Impact of Housing Costs

This reversal is attributed to [[impact_of_housing_costs_on_worker_relocation | extremely high housing prices]] in high-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. For low-skilled workers, the percentage wage gains in these areas do not offset the exorbitant housing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Workers prioritize their standard of living, which considers wages minus the cost of living, with housing being the most significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

Historically, during periods of lighter housing regulation, there was not a significant difference in housing costs between high and low-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. If housing costs could be reduced to more reasonable levels, it is expected that the traditional pattern of workers of all skill levels moving to areas with higher wages would be restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. While the wage gains from internal migration (e.g., 20-30%) are not as dramatic as those seen in international immigration (e.g., factor of 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>, the productivity differences between regions like the Bay Area and the rural South are still substantial enough to likely induce significant mobility if housing costs were not a barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

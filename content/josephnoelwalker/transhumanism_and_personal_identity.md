## Introduction
The conversation delves into the complex interplay between [[philosophical_implications_of_longevity | philosophical implications of longevity]] and personal identity, particularly concerning the concept of transhumanism. Laura Deming, co-founder and CEO of Cradle, and a venture capitalist focused on anti-aging and [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | life extension technologies]], discusses these profound questions. The dialogue begins by exploring the nature of personal identity in the context of vastly extended lifespans, moving into critiques of traditional transhumanism and the broader societal implications of such advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Personal Identity and Longevity
The discussion on personal identity starts with a reference to Derek Parfit's work, specifically his "bundle theory," which posits that individuals are a "web of experiences shifting through time," rather than a singular "ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Laura Deming expresses a deep preoccupation with this question, noting that it's "very subjective" what one wants to preserve over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. She states that neither Eastern nor Western philosophy offers a definitive "right answer" to what should be preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

While arguments can be made for physical continuity over time, these reasons differ from an inherent "need to survive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This philosophical debate is not merely academic; it subconsciously influences how capital is allocated in fields like [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | longevity]] today, shaping what technologies become available in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

In Silicon Valley, Deming observes an initial tendency towards preserving the "physical self" for as long as possible, a "most conservative possible perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. However, upon deeper reflection, many find this view difficult to defend. She draws an analogy to the "no self meditation" in Buddhism, where repeated inquiry into "what is the I?" can lead to a perspective closer to Parfit's bundle theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Even with this shift, the necessity of maintaining physical health and life remains, requiring a reconstruction of why those actions are meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Evolving Perspectives on Longevity
Laura Deming notes a significant shift in her "emotional relation to [[philosophical_implications_of_longevity | longevity]]" over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Initially, her motivation was driven by a "fiery zeal," believing her "job is to fix this problem" of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

However, as she has gotten older, she has come to understand and respect "the argument for the opposite of [[philosophical_implications_of_longevity | longevity]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The pursuit of [[philosophical_implications_of_longevity | longevity]] can cause "extreme mental anguish" if one does not accept certain "horrific and inevitable" aspects of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. She emphasizes the importance of respecting others' metaphysical comfort when contemplating [[philosophical_implications_of_longevity | longevity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Despite this, she maintains that factually, it is "incorrect not to work on longevity drugs" as they are simply a type of medicine, similar to exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

#### The Teleporter Thought Experiment
Deming introduces the "teleporter thought experiment" to illustrate different views on what is valued for preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. In this scenario, a teleporter to Mars creates a copy of you on Mars and destroys the original on Earth. Some would use it, others wouldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

This experiment highlights the question of what one cares about preserving:
*   One's values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   One's current identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   The continued existence of people "similar to you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

In worlds where one prioritizes the well-being of the broader population of conscious entities, one might feel "equally happy" that the population at large is still around, rather than focusing solely on their individual continued existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. However, [[philosophical_implications_of_longevity | longevity]] still offers an argument for extended individual lives, as it allows for the evolution of conscious entities over very long periods, potentially leading to unseen "beauty" in conscious experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Critiques of Traditional Transhumanism
Laura Deming has been searching for a "more humane transhumanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. She identifies several issues with the core framing of traditional transhumanist manifestos:
*   **Lack of Love and Inspiration**: Many manifestos, upon analysis (e.g., searching for the word "love"), reveal a focus on "gaining power" and a "drive to survive," which feels "pretty incomplete" and uninspiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Overconfidence in Predictability**: Traditional transhumanism is "way too confident" in predicting the types of technologies and changes that will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Deming finds it more interesting to consider how populations might change in unpredictable ways, rather than focusing on individuals changing predictably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Individual**: The core framing is often "far too focused on the individual as sort of the unit of analysis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. She suggests that a truly transformative future ("some version of this that we just have no idea what it even looks like yet") will likely involve emergent changes at the population level, not just determined changes in individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

Deming notes that many science fiction authors intentionally avoid writing futures that are too qualitatively different from our own because such narratives are difficult for readers to relate to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This constraint, as mentioned by author Greg Egan, limits truly "new visions" for transhumanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### Literature on Humane Transhumanism
When asked about literature that captures a "more humane transhumanist vision," Deming finds satisfaction in unexpected places:
*   **Rainer Maria Rilke's *Duino Elegies***: Although she only understands a fraction of them, she believes these poems attempt to convey something relevant about an individual trying to connect with a dimly felt, higher level of understanding or experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. The poems use "angels" as a metaphor for something vaguely perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. This resonates with the idea of transhumanism as an attempt to "become something that you don't understand," like a 2D object trying to conceive of a 3D object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   **Mark Stigler's "The Gentle Seduction"**: While acknowledging its appeal, Deming feels this story still avoids the "strangeness the change actually will be" by focusing on a relatable human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. She agrees with the premise of "caring about how people feel" during transformative changes to the human experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

## Sociopolitical Implications of Extended Lifespans
The conversation touches on concerns raised by Francis Fukuyama regarding the [[philosophical_implications_of_longevity | sociopolitical implications of longevity]], particularly the idea that greatly extended lifespans could lead to a less dynamic society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Fukuyama suggests that deeply ingrained "generational effects" from formative experiences might persist, leading to less turnover in positions of power and a stagnation of worldviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

Deming acknowledges that a negative scenario where longevity leads to stagnation can be imagined, but she believes such a society is not necessarily inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. She argues that society is already dynamic, and cultural shifts naturally lead to new styles and ideas replacing older ones, regardless of individual lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.

The ability to remain "creative and fresh" and to continually evolve and find ways to do so, even over a long period, is seen as crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. This circles back to the core question of "what do you want to preserve over time" â€“ emphasizing the potential for continued relevance if individuals are open to evolving parts of their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

From a game theory perspective, unknown and very long periods of time in society might incentivize "pro-social" behavior, as cooperation becomes advantageous when the number of rounds is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

A potential negative implication is the exacerbation of inequality: if the first generation to achieve extreme [[philosophical_implications_of_longevity | longevity]] has significant capital, they gain an "insane advantage" by being able to compound wealth over much longer periods, reducing the traditional advantage of youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. This would necessitate rethinking societal structures, such as wealth taxation over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

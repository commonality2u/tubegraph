The Indian education system plays a significant role in the success of the Indian diaspora, particularly by producing a highly selected pool of talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Selection Process

India's education system is fundamentally designed for "selecting the cream" of its student population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Historically, this design was established during the M period to identify English-educated individuals for civil services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Subsequently, Prime Minister Nehru continued this approach, focusing on selecting top talent to become engineers and doctors, aligning with the country's socialist planning machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This rigorous selection process has been maintained over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Global Impact and Benefits

The consistent selection of high-achieving individuals through the Indian education system has significantly benefited global companies. Firms in America, Silicon Valley, and across the world gain from this pre-selection process, as the talent has already been rigorously vetted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For these companies, the primary task becomes incubating the already selected talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

While the education system is credited for producing an "elite" and "well educated" diaspora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, the ascent of these individuals to top leadership positions, such as CEOs, is further influenced by [[role_of_indian_family_dynamics_in_career_success | large Indian family dynamics]] and the cultural environment of navigating complex social systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This results in an almost "over representation" of Indians in top global jobs, exemplified by figures like Sundar Pichai, Indra Nooyi, Parag Agrawal, and Satya Nadella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Richard Butler is an eminent Australian diplomat and historian of the atomic age, widely recognized for his significant contributions to [[nuclear_nonproliferation_and_its_historical_context | nuclear nonproliferation]] and [[the_future_of_nuclear_disarmament_and_global_security_concerns | nuclear disarmament]] efforts, particularly during the post-Cold War era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. His career highlights include serving as Australia's first Ambassador for Disarmament, Ambassador to the UN, and head of UNSCOM, the UN body tasked with inspecting Iraq for weapons of mass destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:51">[02:27:51]</a>.

## Early Career and Influences

Butler's career began with an early interest in nuclear matters, having worked at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission after university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. This early experience provided him with insight into the internal debates within the Australian government regarding nuclear weapons.

### Australia's Hesitation on the NPT

During the Gorton government (1968-1970), Australia notably delayed signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), being the second-to-last country to sign before its entry into force in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. The primary reason for this delay was to keep open the option of developing its own nuclear arsenal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This stance was heavily influenced by Sir Philip Baxter, then chairman of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, who had worked on the Manhattan Project and advocated for Australia to develop its own nuclear weapons to "keep the hordes away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>, envisioning a reactor at Jervis Bay to produce weapons-grade material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:48]</a>. Butler actively opposed this idea, even likening Baxter to Dr. Strangelove in an article for *The Bulletin* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

The possibility of [[prerequisites_for_australia_to_consider_acquiring_nuclear_weapons | Australia acquiring nuclear weapons]] was "line ball" and "by no means small" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>, underscoring the real threat of [[nuclear_proliferation and its implications | nuclear proliferation]] before the NPT became firmly established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. Dean Rusk, then US Secretary of State, expressed deep concern over Gorton's reluctance to give up the nuclear option, especially due to Gorton's skepticism about reliance on [[challenges_related_to_extended_nuclear_deterrence_and_us_alliances | extended nuclear deterrence]] from the United States in the event of [[implications_of_nuclear_blackmail_and_deterrence_by_countries_like_china | nuclear blackmail]] or attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. Butler himself later admitted some agreement with Gorton's skepticism regarding the US's willingness to use nuclear weapons to protect Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

### Ambassador for Disarmament

In 1983, Bill Hayden, then Australia's foreign minister, appointed Butler as Australia's first Ambassador for Disarmament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:05:00">[49:05:00]</a>. This was a novel role globally, with only Mexico having a similar position at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:14:00">[49:14:00]</a>. The appointment sent "quite a ripple through the international community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:27:00">[49:27:00]</a>. Butler was tasked with leading all Australian [[the_future_of_nuclear_disarmament_and_global_security_concerns | disarmament]] negotiations worldwide, covering chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27:00">[50:27:00]</a>. This role cemented his reputation as "Mr. Disarmament" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:20:00">[52:20:00]</a>, building crucial credibility for his later diplomatic achievements.

### Chief of Staff to Gough Whitlam

Between his diplomatic postings, Butler served as Chief of Staff to former Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam from 1975 to 1977, after Whitlam's dismissal in the 1975 constitutional crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Butler profoundly valued this experience, describing Whitlam as a "towering figure" who "hauled [Australia] out of... an Anglo Colony" and fixed many systemic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. From Whitlam, Butler learned a rigorous methodology for work: begin with facts, assess their meaning, then make decisions and take action with "crystal clarity" and precision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:22">[01:59:22]</a>.

## Key Contributions to Nuclear Diplomacy

### Indefinite Extension of the NPT (1995)

The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which came into effect in 1970, had a 25-year lifespan and required review and extension in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This conference was the only opportunity to permanently extend the NPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. A major challenge was the perception among non-nuclear weapon states that nuclear weapon states had not upheld their bargain to work towards [[the_future_of_nuclear_disarmament_and_global_security_concerns | nuclear disarmament]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

As Australia's Ambassador to the UN in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>, Butler devised a solution: proposing a separate, supplementary set of documents that, while not legally binding, constituted "political commitments" by nuclear weapon states towards disarmament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This package included commitments to a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty and a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) by 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. This innovative approach, conceived on a flight to Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a> and negotiated during an all-night meeting at Butler's New York residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, successfully bridged the divide and led to the NPT's indefinite extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

### Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)

The CTBT, the first nuclear weapons-related arms control treaty negotiated in the post-Cold War era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>, aimed to ban all nuclear tests by explosion in all environments for all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Banning nuclear testing is critical for [[nuclear_nonproliferation and its implications | nonproliferation]] because new nuclear weapon states need to test their devices to ensure they work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

Negotiations for the CTBT at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva were held hostage by India, which, relying on a consensus rule, refused to allow the treaty to be sent to the UN General Assembly for adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Butler, leveraging his diplomatic authority, devised a "homeric trick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>: he tabled an identical draft of the CTBT text at the UN General Assembly under Australia's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. This procedural maneuver, considered "pretty novel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>, bypassed India's veto, leading to the treaty's overwhelming adoption by the General Assembly and opening for signature within a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. President Bill Clinton personally thanked Butler for his efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

While the CTBT has not yet formally entered into force due to stringent ratification requirements (requiring 44 specific states, including India, to ratify it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, it is largely "being acted upon as if it has" entered into force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:21">[01:12:21]</a>.

## Verification and UNSCOM

Butler served as the executive chairman of the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) from 1997 to 1999, the body established by the UN Security Council to inspect Iraq for weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. At its peak, UNSCOM had a thousand inspectors in the field under his direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

Verifying the non-existence of chemical and biological weapons is more challenging than nuclear weapons due to the "dual use" nature of many substances and equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:02">[01:53:02]</a>. Nuclear technology, in contrast, leaves a larger, more easily detectable footprint, requiring massive enrichment or reprocessing plants and leaving clear "throughput figures" of materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:47">[01:51:47]</a>.

## Reflections on Australian Diplomacy

Butler believes Australia has historically been a "true believer" in multilateral diplomacy and the United Nations system, playing an active and positive role in developing international laws and principles of good conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>. He highlights Australia's "extraordinary history that is well above our weight as a middle power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>.

However, Butler expresses concern that Australia's current foreign policy has become too closely identified with the United States, risking its independent foreign policy and being perceived by other nations as a "Lackey or colony of the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:09">[01:23:09]</a>. He critically views the [[impact_of_aukus_on_australias_stance_towards_nuclear_power | AUKUS]] agreement as "the worst foreign policy and national security decision our country has ever taken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:36">[01:46:36]</a>. He remains skeptical that the US would risk nuclear war with China to defend Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:18">[01:49:18]</a>, and notes that US joint facilities in Australia have expanded, some now hosting nuclear-capable B-52 bombers, which he believes contradicts Australia's obligations under the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:51">[01:47:51]</a>.

## Reflections on Nuclear Disarmament and Deterrence

Butler is deeply concerned by the current language surrounding the potential use of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:57">[02:09:57]</a>. He asserts that "[[implications_of_nuclear_blackmail_and_deterrence_by_countries_like_china | nuclear deterrence]] is illusory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:48">[02:21:48]</a> and dismisses concepts like "tactical use" or "minimal deterrence" as "BS" because "once that line is crossed... states in possession of nuclear weapons are going to start loading up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:07">[02:11:07]</a>.

He highlights the core syllogism of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons (1996), which he chaired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:40">[02:08:40]</a>:
1.  As long as nuclear weapons exist, other states will seek to acquire them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:49">[02:11:49]</a>.
2.  As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will one day be used by accident or design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:56">[02:11:56]</a>.
3.  Any such use would be catastrophic for the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:01">[02:12:01]</a>.
Therefore, the only safe thing to do is to eliminate them, which "must be done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:30">[02:10:30]</a>.

Regarding future [[nuclear_proliferation and its implications | nuclear proliferation]], Butler notes that only a handful of states not party to the NPT have acquired nuclear weapons, and all states that signed and ratified the treaty have conformed to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. He mentions that Sweden and South Africa (which later disarmed and joined the NPT) had significant nuclear programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. He worries about countries with authoritarian governments possibly pursuing nuclear weapons, and speculates that nations like Germany or Indonesia might be the next to consider them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

When asked if [[prerequisites_for_australia_to_consider_acquiring_nuclear_weapons | Australia acquiring nuclear weapons]] would be justified if it could no longer rely on US extended deterrence and regional powers developed their own, Butler unequivocally states "it would not be in my view would not be justified" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:31">[02:21:31]</a>.

## Diplomatic Skills and Advice

Butler emphasizes that the most crucial skill for a diplomat is "listening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:07">[02:06:07]</a> and the ability to "decipher what you hear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:48">[02:27:48]</a>. He notes that people, often unwittingly, reveal their true intentions if one listens carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:55">[02:27:55]</a>.

For young people aspiring to careers in reducing the risk of nuclear war, Butler advises:
*   **Learn the facts**: Understand that nuclear weapons still exist and are dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:07">[02:26:07]</a>.
*   **Study**: Pursue education in nuclear science and technology, international politics, international law, and international affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:11">[02:27:11]</a>.
*   **Learn a foreign language**: A relevant foreign language is essential for international affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>.
*   **Develop listening skills**: Learn to listen hard and discern what is truly being said in negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:01">[02:29:01]</a>.

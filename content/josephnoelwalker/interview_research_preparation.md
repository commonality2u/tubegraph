The preparation process for podcast interviews can be "extremely unusual" and akin to "athletic learning" [00:00:41], [00:00:47], [00:03:08]. This intensive approach is driven by a desire to gain a deep understanding of the guest's work and the field it inhabits [00:05:05], [00:06:09].

## Time Commitment

Interview preparation involves significant time investment, often spanning months [00:01:17]. For one interview, the total preparation time can exceed 200 hours [00:03:02], [00:03:04], [00:03:10].

This time is typically divided into two phases:

*   **Non-intensive preparation** This can involve activities like working with a private tutor for two months [00:01:17]-[00:01:18], completing specialized courses (e.g., 50 hours over two weeks) [00:01:31]-[00:01:38], and long-term engagement with the guest's work (e.g., eight years of reading) [00:02:20]-[00:02:25].
*   **Intensive preparation** This phase occurs one to three weeks before the interview [00:02:28]-[00:02:29], involving 8 to 14 hours of daily reading and study [00:02:30]-[00:02:34]. This period can add another 100 hours of focused work [00:03:02]-[00:03:04].

This extensive preparation is motivated by having a "concrete thing that you are trying to be able to do with great excellence" â€“ the interview itself [00:03:43]-[00:03:45].

## Learning Strategies

Effective preparation involves a multi-faceted approach to learning and knowledge acquisition.

### Orienting to the Material
When an interview is booked, and a vast amount of material is available, the first step is to orient oneself to the subject [00:04:06]-[00:04:32].

This involves:
*   **Consulting experts:** Seeking advice from professors or industry professionals on a syllabus and key topics [00:05:20]-[00:05:25]. The goal is to gain an "undergraduate understanding of probability and statistics" within a limited timeframe (e.g., two months) [00:05:53]-[00:06:03].
*   **Prioritizing content:** Asking experts which parts of textbooks or topics are most important and what can be omitted given time constraints [00:07:07]-[00:07:24]. The reading list constantly evolves as new context is gained, making it impossible to make a serious plan far in advance [01:15:01]-[01:15:05].

### Tutoring and Collaborative Learning
Working with a tutor can be highly beneficial, especially for foundational subjects like probability and statistics [00:07:26]-[00:07:27], [00:07:50]-[00:07:55].

*   **Peer relationship:** Tutors can sometimes act as peers, working through textbooks and solving problems together [00:08:10]-[00:08:13], [00:08:28]-[00:08:42].
*   **Problem-solving:** Sessions often involve working through practice problems on a whiteboard, sometimes jointly, sometimes separately before comparing notes [00:08:37]-[00:09:23].
*   **Prerequisite chaining:** Tutors help identify and address gaps in foundational knowledge (e.g., remembering concepts from Algebra 2) [00:10:09]-[00:10:30]. This provides "mini-lessons" on the spot, a benefit unavailable when studying alone [00:10:32]-[00:10:42].

### Just-in-Time Learning
When encountering unfamiliar concepts in a guest's primary works (e.g., options trading, futures trading) [00:12:32]-[00:12:47], just-in-time learning is crucial [00:12:55]-[00:12:57].
*   **Digital tools:** This involves Googling terms or using large language models (LLMs) to quickly look up definitions or clarify concepts [00:13:09]-[00:13:17].
*   **Consulting friends:** Reaching out to friends or contacts with expertise is useful when digital searches are insufficient or when one suspects their own question is ill-posed [00:13:20]-[00:13:44].

### Reading and Comprehension
Reading is a purposeful activity, involving active engagement with the text [00:15:25]-[00:15:33].
*   **Physical books with digital support:** Physical books are preferred, often with a digital PDF version open simultaneously in an LLM wrapper like AI Drive [00:32:29]-[00:32:45]. This allows for direct questioning of technical explanations within the text [00:34:41]-[00:35:28].
*   **Monitoring understanding:** It's critical to monitor comprehension while reading [00:35:46]-[00:35:50]. If a concept is important and not understood, it is immediately looked up to prevent it from affecting the understanding of subsequent material [00:37:27]-[00:37:38].
*   **Strategic note-taking:** Handwritten notes are taken during tutoring sessions [00:11:16]-[00:11:18]. Important sections or ideas for future memory prompts are marked with physical book tags (Post-it notes) [00:36:55]-[00:37:02], [00:37:14]-[00:37:16]. This prevents interrupting the reading flow [00:37:05]-[00:37:07] and allows for later refinement as understanding evolves throughout a chapter [00:41:21]-[00:41:44].

## Tooling and Organization

A mix of digital and physical tools is used for note-taking, question formulation, and recall.

### Note-Taking Systems
*   **Multi-app approach:** Multiple note-taking applications (e.g., Apple Notes, Obsidian) are used, often reflecting the evolution of the user's workflow over years [00:17:20]-[00:17:31].
*   **Mega Notes:** A "mega note" for a guest can accumulate over years, containing raw thoughts, vague question ideas, links to interviews, critiques, and other sources [00:16:32]-[00:16:55]. These are often "ramblings of a madman" [00:18:00]-[00:18:03] but serve as a comprehensive dumping ground for ideas.
*   **Per-book notes:** Dedicated notes are created for each book, containing commentary, and excerpts [00:38:15]-[00:38:28]. These notes can also include questions that need further investigation [00:39:03]-[00:39:05].

### Spaced Repetition (Mochi)
Spaced repetition software like Mochi is used for memory prompts [00:02:41]-[00:02:44].
*   **Prompt creation:** Prompts are created at the end of chapters using the marked sections from physical books [00:41:14]-[00:41:22]. This allows for a final review of which ideas are important enough to commit to memory [00:41:25]-[00:41:44].
*   **Integration with notes:** Prompts are stored within Obsidian notes, using a plugin (Mochi Cards Pro) [00:44:43]-[00:45:00]. This allows prompts to be embedded with their original context, enabling editing if the underlying knowledge changes [00:58:54]-[00:59:02].
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Compounding knowledge:** Prompts created for past interviews are leveraged for future ones, making study more rewarding and durable [00:47:05]-[00:47:23].
    *   **Daily learning acceleration:** Retaining more information from daily prompts makes subsequent days of intensive study easier [00:48:11]-[00:48:22].
    *   **Immediate feedback and motivation:** Daily review of prompts provides a short, rewarding feedback cycle, combating the loneliness and tedium of solo research [00:49:56]-[00:50:27].
*   **Prompt writing principles:**
    *   **Empathy for future self:** Write prompts that are unambiguously clear and durably useful, avoiding ambiguity [00:51:26]-[00:51:42].
    *   **Understand before you memorize:** Do not write a prompt on something not fully understood [00:52:08]-[00:52:10]. An exception might be for definitional terms, as slowly learning the language can aid eventual comprehension [00:52:36]-[00:53:01].
    *   **Practice application:** Create prompts that require applying a technique or generating new examples, rather than just recalling a definition [01:13:25]-[01:14:53].

### Question Management (Kanban Board)
An Obsidian Kanban plugin is used to manage and [[structuring_and_prioritizing_interview_questions | structure and prioritize interview questions]] [01:02:47]-[01:03:47].
*   **Dumping ground:** Initially, questions are dumped into an "uncategorized" column [01:06:01]-[01:06:03]. These questions are often messy, with multiple versions, and are not perfectly formed [01:07:22]-[01:07:37].
*   **Categorization:** Questions are then moved into columns based on different themes or topics [01:05:59]-[01:06:01], which emerge as research progresses [01:06:14]-[01:06:24].
*   **Sequencing:** The Kanban board allows for easy reorganization of questions, which is crucial for establishing a narrative arc and setting premises in an interview [01:08:12]-[01:08:29].
*   **Meta-questions:** Meta-level insights about interviewing itself (e.g., "practice loading more context into the preface of a question to get a better answer") are also pinned as cards on the board [01:09:25]-[01:10:14].

### Physical Boards
Physical whiteboards or large sheets of paper can also be used, offering a three-dimensional workspace for interleaving notes and questions [01:25:21]-[01:25:44]. These allow for easy reorganization and visual categorization of ideas and questions [01:26:06]-[01:27:22].

## Goals and Self-Correction

The preparation process is driven by specific goals and involves continuous self-correction.

### Interview Goals
*   **Furnish context:** Provide oneself with sufficient context for the interview and the guest's body of work [00:06:09]-[00:06:16].
*   **Engage deeply:** Be able to engage deeply with the guest to ask good questions and participate effectively [00:06:41]-[00:06:45].
*   **Avoid looking foolish:** Prevent asking "silly or a waste of time" questions that might cause the guest to lose respect [00:28:50]-[00:29:28].
*   **Elicit valuable answers:** Ask penetrating questions that lead to better, perhaps previously unshared, answers [00:29:55]-[00:30:23].
*   **Be a translator:** Understand the material well enough to explain or contextualize it for the audience [00:29:33]-[00:29:49].

### Continuous Improvement
*   **Falsifying questions:** Actively seeking to disprove or refute initial questions, especially those that seem "juicy," to ensure they are well-posed and interesting [00:28:35]-[00:28:48].
*   **Learning from "failures":** Recognizing moments where preparation was inadequate (e.g., not understanding the field deeply, asking questions without sufficient background) [01:17:33]-[01:20:20], [01:21:19]-[01:22:15]. This leads to rules like "if you don't understand the question, don't ask it" [01:21:51]-[01:21:53].
*   **Balancing prep and outcome:** Acknowledging that not all prep is ultimately useful in the interview itself, but that the preparation process can still be valuable in and of itself [01:28:34]-[01:29:02], [01:29:31]-[01:29:37]. Increased efficiency in prep can lead to more interviews and broader impact [01:29:42]-[01:30:00].
*   **Learning the art of interviewing:** Simultaneous learning about the domain and the craft of interviewing, with dedicated Mochi decks for interview techniques [01:10:24]-[01:11:05].

### Sharing the Process
There is an aspiration to share elements of the prep process publicly [01:29:09]-[01:29:22]. This includes:
*   Publishing Mochi decks (memory prompts) [01:34:46]-[01:35:10].
*   Publishing Obsidian notes [01:34:22]-[01:34:24].
*   Publishing video recordings of the preparation work and calls with private tutors [01:34:26]-[01:34:47].
The goal is to provide insights into the often-invisible nature of knowledge work and study [01:37:00]-[01:37:15], allowing others to benefit from the methods employed [01:38:00]-[01:39:01].

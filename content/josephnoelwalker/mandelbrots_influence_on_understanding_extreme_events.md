[[Nassim Talebs theories on Extremistan | Nassim Taleb]] highlights a fundamental disagreement with traditional super-forecasting, centered on the distinction between binary and continuous payoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. His insights, deeply influenced by Mandelbrot, emphasize the problematic nature of standard statistical approaches when dealing with extreme events.

## Binary vs. Continuous Payoffs

Taleb, from his experience as an option trader, observed that naive individuals often misunderstand how [[the_impact_of_fat_tails_on_prediction_and_option_value | fattening the tail]] of a probability distribution affects options. For an out-of-the-money binary option, [[the_impact_of_fat_tails_on_prediction_and_option_value | fattening the tail]] actually causes its value to decrease, because a binary option is fundamentally a probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. In contrast, for continuous options, [[the_impact_of_fat_tails_on_prediction_and_option_value | fattening the tail]] typically increases value.

In a Gaussian distribution, if one were to [[understanding_fat_tails_in_probability_distributions | fatten the tail]] (e.g., increasing deviations from the mean), the probabilities of values being far from the mean actually *drop* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This occurs because the variance becomes more explained by rare events, causing the body of the distribution to rise and the shoulders to narrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This leads to more ordinary events alongside much more pronounced, though rare, deviations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This phenomenon highlights why using binary options or anything that clips upside is a misguided strategy in systems prone to extreme events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Critiquing Superforecasting

Taleb argues that super-forecasters often fall short because they tend to sub-select events that are inconsequential for forecasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. More critically, they fail to account for the variable size or impact of events. For instance, forecasting "will there be a war (yes/no)" ignores the vast difference between a war killing two people versus one killing 600,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Mandelbrot's Insights on [[Nassim Talebs theories on Extremistan | Extremistan]]

A core tenet derived from Mandelbrot's work, frequently repeated by him, is:
> "There is no such thing as a standard deviation in [[Nassim Talebs theories on Extremistan | Extremistan]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

This statement implies that one cannot assess an event, such as a pandemic, merely as a binary occurrence ("yes" or "no") because its ultimate size and impact are random variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

In [[Nassim Talebs theories on Extremistan | Extremistan]], phenomena follow "scale-free distributions," such as the Pareto distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This means the ratio between large events remains constant (e.g., 10 million people to 5 million people is similar to 20 million to 10 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The profound consequence is that there is "no standard event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> or "no typical event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Unlike Gaussian distributions where the expected deviation shrinks as one goes further from the mean, in [[Nassim Talebs theories on Extremistan | Extremistan]], the scale remains consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. For example, the expected additional lifespan at 100 years might be 2 years, but if human lifespans were scale-free, a 1000-year-old might have another 500 years to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

This concept of an "explosion" in absolute terms while remaining proportionally constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> is key to understanding that there is no standard large deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Mandelbrot's perspective reveals that the world lacks a characteristic scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, a framework Taleb found instrumental in understanding events like the 1987 stock market crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Implications for Forecasting

This understanding led Taleb to dedicate his book, *The Black Swan*, to Mandelbrot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, based on the idea of characteristic scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. If this idea is accepted, then traditional forecasting becomes problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

Taleb and his co-authors argued against point forecasts for [[understanding_fat_tails_in_probability_distributions | fat tail]] variables in a paper titled "On the Inadequacy of a Single Forecast for a Fat Tail Variable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. They demonstrated this with pandemic data, showing that the distribution of people killed follows a [[understanding_fat_tails_in_probability_distributions | fat tail]] exponent less than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

It is considered foolish to forecast such events, and even more foolish to critique a forecast for missing an event, as 95% of observations in a [[understanding_fat_tails_in_probability_distributions | fat tail]] distribution will be below the mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. For example, if a trader loses money 98% of the time but makes significant profits during the rare 2%, it's meaningless to say they are consistently losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Payoff Space vs. Frequency Space

This highlights the crucial distinction between "frequency space" and "payoff space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Winston Churchill, for instance, was frequently "wrong" on many smaller issues (frequency space), but crucially "right" on the major question of Hitler's intentions (payoff space), leading to significant consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This is analogous to "losing a battle and winning the war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

Taleb himself states that he could be bullish on the market (higher probability of going up in frequency space) but simultaneously short it (expecting a bigger payoff from a rare downside event) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

### The Problem of Binary Forecasts

Binary forecasts, though useful for events like elections, struggle to integrate variance into their assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. A small error in forecasting a growth rate for something like a pandemic can lead to a [[understanding_fat_tails_in_probability_distributions | Pareto]] distribution of outcomes for the number of people killed due to exponential transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This means a finite expectation for a rate can lead to an infinite expectation for the final outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

This concept also applies to "Value at Risk" (VaR) measurements, which often define a confidence interval (e.g., 95% certainty of not losing more than X amount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. However, the remaining 5% is where the true risk lies, as losses can be exponentially higher when they occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## Probability as a Kernel

For Taleb, a crucial sign of understanding probability is recognizing that it is not a "product" but a "kernel" – something that adds up to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Probabilities cannot be isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. A probability density function (PDF) must be understood in the context of the function it is applied to (G(x) in ∫ P(x)G(x)dx) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. The probability P(x) by itself has no inherent meaning; it only gains meaning when integrated with a payoff function G(x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

Option traders, for instance, focus on the value of the option, which provides a continuous payoff, reflecting the reality of [[understanding_fat_tails_in_probability_distributions | fat tail]] distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. This fundamental difference in understanding probability and its application distinguishes Taleb's approach from that of super-forecasters.

Brian Kaplan's book, "Build, Baby, Build: The Science and Ethics of Housing Regulation," explores the complexities of [[zoning_regulations_and_their_impact_on_housing_supply | housing regulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Kaplan's broader work is characterized by the idea that "the world's wrong because human beings are wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, often due to a failure to apply common sense when it conflicts with emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. He argues that many regulations persist because people believe the world would be worse without them, rather than considering personal financial harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:56">[01:22:56]</a>.

## Envisioning Deregulated America

With full [[housing_deregulation_and_productivity | housing deregulation]], downtowns would likely gain the most in percentage terms due to current high regulation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The primary issue in cities is the difficulty of building skyscrapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, often combined with strict historic site regulations in places like San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. In suburbs, multi-family housing is difficult to build, with roughly 80% of residential land reserved for single-family homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Even for single-family homes, regulations often require excessive land, such as minimum lot sizes of an acre, two acres, or even five acres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

Kaplan suggests that deregulation would lead to more urbanized areas, but also more space per person, as construction could increase in every location, making housing more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. For example, living in Manhattan could mean spacious and affordable apartments, rather than tiny shoeboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Measuring Zoning's Impact on Prices

The approach pioneered by Joe Gjerko and Ed Glaeser is a notable method for measuring the impact of [[zoning_regulations_and_their_impact_on_housing_supply | zoning regulations]] on house prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This method seeks to find similar homes where some have more land than others to determine the value of "pure land" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Their findings indicate that people value additional undeveloped land very little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

The "zoning tax" is a metaphorical term used to describe the full regulatory burden, representing the difference between market price and the physical cost of land and construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

One criticism of this method is that marginal land parcels are valued little because they are indivisible and cannot be used for construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Kaplan counters that this is not reasonable when considering [[zoning_regulations_and_their_impact_on_housing_supply | zoning regulations]] that mandate extra land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Developers typically want to build as many properties as legally possible, indicating that people don't appreciate the extra land mandated by regulations enough to justify preventing additional construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Later work by Gjerko, using prices of actual vacant lots, yielded similar results, supporting the method's soundness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Housing Regulation and Immigration

Kaplan suggests that the link between [[the_relationship_between_immigration_housing_and_economic_growth | immigration]] and housing as a zero-sum game is overstated for the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Most regulations are set at the local level, with significant variation across states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. States like Texas, with lighter regulation, experience massive population increases due to affordable housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

Kaplan argues that immigrants move to places where building is allowed, so it is not necessary to deregulate housing nationwide before allowing [[the_relationship_between_immigration_housing_and_economic_growth | immigration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. He advocates for allowing the housing industry to build more homes, noting that many construction workers are themselves immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. While the US coped well with modest regulation for 50 years after zoning began in the 1920s, current regulations are much stricter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Kaplan supports a "shock doctrine" approach, suggesting that deregulating other areas (like [[the_relationship_between_immigration_housing_and_economic_growth | immigration]]) might create pressure to deregulate housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

Regarding the argument that low-skilled [[the_relationship_between_immigration_housing_and_economic_growth | immigration]] pushes down wages for domestic low-skilled workers, Kaplan asserts that estimates of this effect are small at best, and some studies suggest it may even go the other way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. This is because native and foreign low-skilled workers often have different skills, with natives specializing in jobs requiring language skills (e.g., supervisors), leading to promotions for natives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

## [[housing_deregulation_and_productivity | Productivity]] Gains from Deregulation

Kaplan argues that [[housing_deregulation_and_productivity | housing deregulation]] would lead to massive [[housing_deregulation_and_productivity | productivity]] gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. This is based on the principle that restricting movement prevents workers from moving from low-productivity areas to high-productivity areas, where their earnings (and thus productivity) would be much higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>. This is analogous to [[the_relationship_between_immigration_housing_and_economic_growth | immigration]], where moving a low-skilled worker from Haiti to Miami can increase their productivity tenfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

Historically, people in the US moved freely from low-wage areas (e.g., rural Mississippi) to high-wage areas (e.g., California) for better pay and life, indicating increased productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. However, modern US data shows that while high-skilled workers still move to high-productivity areas, low-skilled workers are increasingly moving *away* from high-wage areas like San Francisco to lower-wage areas like Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. This "weird" trend is attributed to extremely high housing prices in high-productivity areas, which offset wage gains for lower-skilled workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. If housing costs were reasonable, this traditional mobility would be restored, increasing overall [[housing_deregulation_and_productivity | productivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.

Kaplan refutes the idea that expanding cities through deregulation would dilute the talent pool or reduce innovation. He argues that the majority of workers in high-tech hubs are not "ultra high-skilled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. Adding more lower-skilled workers would not disrupt the innovation mechanism, especially since firms like Google already hire many such workers for basic tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. In fact, increasing the number of both low- and high-skilled workers could enhance innovation by bringing more innovators into concentrated areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

Regarding the "economies of scale" argument that growth might raise prices, Kaplan explains that while agglomeration effects initially increase rents due to higher productivity, the ability to build more housing is virtually unlimited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. Unlike the scarce supply of human talent in elite institutions, the talent and resources for construction are abundant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. Therefore, increased demand from agglomeration could be met by increased supply, keeping prices in check.

### Errors in Economic Research
Kaplan notes that basic errors can be found in influential economic papers, citing his discovery of multiplication errors in a 2019 paper by Shay and Meret concerning [[housing_deregulation_and_productivity | productivity]] gains from deregulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. Interestingly, correcting these errors led to a conclusion of even *larger* gains to deregulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>. He suggests that referees for top journals focus on complex intellectual demands rather than basic arithmetic checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

## Housing Regulation and Fertility

Kaplan suggests that [[housing_affordability_crisis_in_Australia | housing unaffordability]] may contribute to declining fertility rates, offering a more tractable solution than cultural explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. While some research associates density with reduced fertility (e.g., Tokyo, Seoul), Kaplan argues that these studies often fail to disentangle density from high prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. There are few examples of high-density, low-price cities to compare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>.

He maintains that allowing cheaper suburban housing will increase fertility by providing more space and enabling people to leave their parents' homes earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>. A key sociological factor affecting fertility is the tendency for young adults to live with their parents, particularly prevalent in Southern and Eastern Europe, making marriage and having children awkward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>.

Kaplan acknowledges that broader societal wealth correlates with declining fertility, but points out that housing is an exception where people often cannot replicate their parents' standard of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. He sees economic shifts like [[housing_deregulation_and_productivity | housing deregulation]] as a sensible response to cultural trends favoring "a life of play" over having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.

## Urbanism and Architecture

Kaplan, through his graphic novel "Build, Baby, Build," addresses aesthetic objections to construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a>. He contends that many objections are based on imagined negative aesthetics rather than actual outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>. He envisions a deregulated future where cities could become "gorgeous" and "incredible futuristic cit[ies]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:28">[01:15:28]</a>.

Drawing on [[historical_context_of_the_housing_crisis | historical context]], Kaplan notes that in Japan, historic preservation is less of a concern due to widespread destruction during World War II, fostering a culture of rebuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>. Japan also demonstrates the benefits of mixed-use development, where businesses can easily operate at ground level in residential buildings, increasing convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>.

Kaplan discusses the concept of "Bastiat buildings," inspired by economist Frédéric Bastiat, who distinguished between "what is seen" and "what is not seen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>. People often focus on the visible benefits of regulation or the visible negative impacts of new construction (e.g., blocking views, casting shadows), without seeing the "better" alternative that deregulation could bring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. Examples of extreme regulations include historic parking lots and vacant lots in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>.

## [[public_perceptions_and_political_challenges_of_housing_deregulation | Public Perceptions and Political Challenges]]

Surveys in the US and Australia show that 30-40% of people believe a large increase in housing stock would cause rents and home prices to *rise* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>. Kaplan refers to this as "supply skepticism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:47">[01:20:47]</a>. Despite this, homeowners who might benefit from higher prices do not necessarily become YIMBYs (Yes In My Backyard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>.

Kaplan explains that [[public_perceptions_and_political_challenges_of_housing_deregulation | political scientists]] find little connection between objective material self-interest and political views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>. Homeowners and tenants exhibit similar levels of resistance to deregulation, suggesting that opposition is not primarily driven by personal financial harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>. Instead, it stems from a general belief that deregulation would be "bad for society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:04">[01:23:04]</a>. Opposition often focuses on issues like increased traffic or parking problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:29">[01:24:29]</a>.

While state governments have initiated [[policy_solutions_to_address_the_housing_crisis | policy solutions to address the housing crisis]] by pressuring local governments to deregulate (e.g., California, Oregon, Minnesota), this is often driven by elites who understand the benefits, rather than widespread public support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>. Politicians hope that the appreciation for lower housing prices will outweigh dissatisfaction with specific policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:01">[01:29:01]</a>. Public support for affordable housing tends to favor public housing, despite its small impact and lack of personal desire to live there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>.

Kaplan notes that YIMBYism is currently somewhat bipartisan, with vocal left-wing activists in blue cities and red states that are YIMBY by default due to lighter regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:18">[01:32:18]</a>. However, he predicts that YIMBYism may become left-coded due to the visibility of left-wing activists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>.

## Long-Term Outlook

Looking at the very long run, Kaplan believes that humanity will likely densify all available land mass, potentially resembling a "Coruscant" (a planet-wide city from Star Wars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:47">[01:42:47]</a>. This is based on the idea that despite current low fertility rates, life will find a way, driven by genetic variation in fertility preferences that will eventually lead to a pronatal human psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:59">[01:42:59]</a>. This long-term population growth will necessitate extreme density and the use of advanced technology to sustain a massive global population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:26">[01:44:26]</a>.

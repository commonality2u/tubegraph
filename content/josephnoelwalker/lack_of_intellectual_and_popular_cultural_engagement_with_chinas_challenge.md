Despite the significant [[us_and_china_strategic_relationship | rise of China]] as a great power, the United States has yet to demonstrate a comprehensive, whole-of-nation response to the perceived challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This lack of engagement is evident both at the political leadership level and within the broader intellectual and popular culture.

## Absence of a National Mission

Since [[us_and_china_strategic_relationship | China's rise]] began in the early post-[[comparison_of_chinas_challenge_to_historical_threats_like_cold_war_and_world_war_ii | Cold War]] years, no American president has declared that confronting China is the nation's primary [[americas_national_mission_regarding_chinas_rise | national mission]], requiring the devotion of the entire country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

The economic scale of the [[us_and_china_strategic_relationship | challenge]] posed by China is unprecedented. No other power or group of powers has ever approached 60% of American GDP, a figure China has now surpassed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Economically, this is a [[comparison_of_chinas_challenge_to_historical_threats_like_cold_war_and_world_war_ii | much bigger challenge than the Cold War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, and already a greater [[us_china_economic_and_military_power_dynamics | economic challenge than Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

> [!INFO] Whole-of-Nation Effort
> Addressing this challenge would require a "whole of nation" effort, not just a "whole of government" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Such a massive undertaking cannot be done quietly or be confined to the political "Beltway"; it necessitates a presidential declaration to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. To date, no president has taken this step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Limited Intellectual and Popular Cultural Engagement

The current [[role_of_american_intellectuals_and_media_in_addressing_the_china_challenge | intellectual environment in the US]] does not suggest that the nation is [[assessment_of_americas_preparedness_for_a_contest_with_china | primed for a contest]] of this magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This is observable in both popular culture and academic circles:

*   **Popular Culture:** The [[us_and_china_strategic_relationship | China challenge]] is largely absent from popular discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. For instance, popular commentators like Joe Rogan are not preoccupied with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Sphere (Beyond the Beltway):** While there are numerous books by American scholars, think-tankers, political advisers, and military analysts about China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, and publications like *Foreign Affairs* are replete with articles on the [[us_and_china_strategic_relationship | China Challenge]] and [[us_and_china_strategic_relationship | China threat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, this engagement does not extend far beyond the "Beltway crowd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Prominent public intellectuals like David Brooks and Ross Douthat are not writing books on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Historical Comparisons

The current situation does not resemble past national challenges in terms of widespread engagement:

*   **[[comparison_of_chinas_challenge_to_historical_threats_like_cold_war_and_world_war_ii | Cold War]]:** The [[comparison_of_chinas_challenge_to_historical_threats_like_cold_war_and_world_war_ii | Cold War liberalism]] movement emerged as an entire school of thought that engaged deeply with the issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **War on Terrorism:** Even the War on Terrorism saw figures like Andrew Sullivan, Christopher Hitchens, Paul Berman, Michael Ignatieff, and *The New York Times* editorial page extensively debating how to maintain liberal democracy against the radical Islamist threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Currently, there is no similar [[role_of_american_intellectuals_and_media_in_addressing_the_china_challenge | intellectual ferment]] in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This lack of broad intellectual support undermines the ability to address the [[us_and_china_strategic_relationship | scale of the challenge]] that the American governing class claims to be undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

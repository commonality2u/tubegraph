Memory prompts play a crucial role in [[tips on systematic interview preparation | systematic interview preparation]], particularly in an [[impact_of_thorough_preparation on interviews | intensive prep process]] for complex topics such as those encountered during podcast interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:09">[02:41:09]</a>. This method, which incorporates elements of [[tips on systematic interview preparation | spaced repetition]], aids in robust knowledge acquisition and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:09">[02:41:09]</a>.

## How Memory Prompts are Integrated

Memory prompts are created daily, based on material studied the previous day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:55">[02:42:55]</a>. The process involves:
*   **Initial Note-taking** While reading, handwritten notes are taken on a notepad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:51">[04:16:51]</a>.
*   **Using Book Tags (Post-it Notes)** Physical books are marked with Post-it notes to identify passages that will later be converted into memory prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:07">[03:57:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:12">[04:11:12]</a>. These tags are also used to mark important excerpts that may not become prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:03">[04:24:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:10">[04:27:10]</a>.
*   **Delayed Prompt Creation** Prompts are typically written at the end of a chapter or study session rather than on the spot. This approach prevents interruption of the reading flow, reduces distraction, and ensures that the most "Atomic ideas" from the material are selected, superseding less important points identified earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:14">[04:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:51">[04:19:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:46">[04:28:46]</a>.
*   **Integration with Digital Tools** Obsidian is used to house the prompts, often in a separate section at the bottom of the main note, to avoid interspersing them directly with the core content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:53">[04:31:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:58">[04:42:58]</a>. The Mochi Cards Pro plugin is used to extract these prompts for review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:02">[04:43:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:02">[04:47:02]</a>.
*   **Daily Review** Each morning, prompts from the previous day's material are reviewed, which helps in compounding information and preparing for the next day's study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:55">[02:42:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:05">[04:52:05]</a>. This immediate review highlights concepts that were not fully grasped, even an hour or two after initial exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:05">[04:57:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:57">[05:06:57]</a>.

## Benefits of Memory Prompts

Memory prompts offer several advantages for learners:
*   **Knowledge Compounding** Prompts created for past interviews remain useful for future ones, fostering a sense of durable knowledge growth. This makes studying more rewarding and impactful over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:02">[04:47:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:19">[04:51:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:19">[04:51:19]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Retention** By regularly reviewing prompts, more information is retained, which streamlines subsequent study sessions in an [[impact_of_thorough_preparation on interviews | intensive sprint]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:05">[04:52:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   **Motivation and Feedback** The daily ritual of reviewing prompts provides immediate feedback, reinforcing learning and serving as a powerful motivator. Achieving high accuracy (e.g., 90% correct) is rewarding, turning the often tedious and lonely process of solo research into a more engaging experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:54">[05:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:27">[05:26:27]</a>.
*   **Visibility of Progress** The creation of prompts provides a tangible output, signaling progress and growth, unlike passively reading a book which retains its shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:05">[05:29:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:06">[05:36:06]</a>.

## Challenges in Prompt Writing

Writing effective memory prompts can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:02">[05:40:02]</a>. Key principles and [[Heuristics and biases in decision making | heuristics]] include:
*   **Empathy for Future Self** Prompts should be clear and unambiguous, anticipating how one's future self will interpret them to avoid confusion or triviality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:26">[05:25:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:05">[05:32:05]</a>.
*   **Understanding Before Memorization** A core rule is to avoid writing prompts about material that is not fully understood, aligning with the principle of "understand before you memorize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:32">[05:27:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:05">[05:32:05]</a>. However, an exception can be made for definitional concepts, as even a partial understanding helps in acquiring the language and facilitates eventual comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:48">[05:35:48]</a>.
*   **Revising and Suspending Prompts** Approximately 5-10% of prompts may require revision due to convoluted or unclear phrasing. About 1% might be deemed unnecessary or unhelpful and can be suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:52">[05:51:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:03">[06:05:03]</a>. It is crucial to immediately edit prompts when issues are identified, rather than postponing, to ensure accuracy and prevent forgetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:44">[06:09:44]</a>.

### Example of Prompt Improvement
An example discussed for improving a prompt like "What is a very easy way to transform potentially any question into a more interesting one?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a> highlights the challenge of open-ended prompts. Potential improvements include:
*   **Specificity** Limiting the answer to a specific source or context, such as "What did [person] say is a very easy way..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.
*   **Generative Questions** Asking for multiple examples, like "Name three easy ways to transform any question into a more interesting one," allowing for varied answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>.
*   **Application Practice** Creating prompts that require the application of a technique, e.g., "Use the negation insight to improve [question]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:48">[01:13:48]</a>.
*   **Contextual Cues** Incorporating specific contextual cues into the prompt to aid recall, such as "When running a loop around the Berkeley campus, what was the advice on X?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.
*   **Creative Constraints** Adding constraints like "make it one you haven't created before" to encourage divergent thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>.

This [[Continuous improvement in decision making | continuous improvement]] in prompt writing is a meta-skill that enhances the overall learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>.

## Sharing the Learning Process

To maximize the value of the extensive preparation, the internal prep process, including memory prompts, is considered for public sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>. This includes publishing:
*   **Mochi Decks** The full Mochi decks used for preparation, such as for the Larry Summers or Fukuyama interviews, will be shared. While their direct utility may vary, they offer insight into the rigorous prep methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:42">[01:33:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:51">[01:35:51]</a>.
*   **Obsidian Notes** The underlying Obsidian notes, containing excerpts and research, will also be made public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a>.
*   **Video Recordings** "Fly-on-the-wall" video recordings of the preparation process, including study sessions and calls with private tutors, aim to demystify the "invisible" nature of deep learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:26">[01:34:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This transparency can illustrate what it looks like to seriously engage with and interrogate complex material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:48">[01:37:48]</a>, thereby addressing common [[challenges in learning and comprehension | challenges in learning and comprehension]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:19">[01:38:19]</a>. These recordings highlight the effort involved, countering beliefs that deep understanding is solely due to inherent talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:15">[01:37:15]</a>.
*   **Balancing Transparency and Privacy** Care is taken to ensure that sharing tutor calls does not alter the dynamic of the session, and that confidential information from external advisors is respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:26">[01:35:26]</a>.

This strategy emphasizes that the prep itself holds significant value beyond the final interview, justifying the substantial investment of time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>. It's an exploration of whether such intensive, broad preparation can allow a non-expert to engage deeply with specialists, effectively bridging knowledge gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

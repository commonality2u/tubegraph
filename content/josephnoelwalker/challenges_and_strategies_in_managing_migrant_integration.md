Australia's experience with migrant integration and acculturation stands out globally, particularly due to its high proportion of overseas-born residents and its multicultural population. Despite this success, challenges in managing the immigration system and addressing public perceptions persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:50">[01:37:50]</a>.

## Australia's Success in Acculturation

Australia has one of the youngest and most multicultural populations in the developed world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:16">[01:37:16]</a>. Approximately 30% of the population was born overseas, which is believed to be the highest rate in the developed world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:44">[01:30:44]</a>. Australia also boasts a greater spread of nationalities than any other country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:40">[01:51:40]</a>. This high level of diversity has coexisted with high rates of social cohesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:58">[01:51:58]</a>. Surveys indicate strong support for multiculturalism, with about 85% of respondents in a Scanlon Institute survey expressing support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:01">[01:52:01]</a>.

### Contributing Factors to Success

Several factors are cited for Australia's success in acculturation:

*   **Bipartisan Political Support:** Since 1945, there has been consistent bipartisan political support for immigration and multiculturalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:49">[01:55:49]</a>. Leaders like Arthur Calwell and Robert Menzies agreed on the importance of immigration and gradually broadened the range of source countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:35">[01:52:35]</a>. This consensus continued through subsequent governments, including Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke, and John Howard, who, despite initial reluctance, eventually accepted the term "multiculturalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:11">[01:53:11]</a>.
*   **Targeted Skilled Migration:** Australia's policy has largely focused on attracting young, skilled, and English-proficient migrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. Abel Rizvi suggests that the high skill level of immigrants, often educated in Western systems (or in Australia itself), may contribute to their shared cultural beliefs and ways of thinking, aiding in integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:41">[01:57:41]</a>. Educating skilled migrants in Australia during their formative years means they "learn Aussie things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:12">[01:58:12]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Settlement Services:** The development of range of Settlement Services, notably strengthened after the Frank Galbally report in the late 1970s, has played a crucial role in maintaining multiculturalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:18">[01:53:18]</a>. These services, including adult migrant English programs and local settlement organizations, provide support for new arrivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.
*   **Geographic Isolation:** Australia's status as an island nation, "a long way from anybody," offers a natural advantage in managing borders and immigration flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>. This has allowed for the implementation of robust control systems like the universal visa system and the electronic Travel Authority (ETA), which tracks people entering and exiting the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a>.

## Challenges in Migrant Integration and Public Perception

While generally successful, Australia faces ongoing [[issues_of_migration_control_and_public_perception | issues of migration control and public perception]] and challenges in integration:

*   **Public Confidence in Control:** The political elite in Australia believes there's an equilibrium between being strict on illegal immigration and maintaining a liberal legal migration program, underpinned by the idea that public trust hinges on the government's perceived control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:58">[04:39:58]</a>. When net migration numbers significantly exceed forecasts, public attitudes can shift against immigration, leading to concerns about infrastructure capacity and service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:50">[04:42:50]</a>.
*   **Housing Crisis and Scapegoating:** When economic conditions are difficult, such as high housing costs, immigrants are often unfairly blamed. While international students can impact housing demand near universities, their effect on suburban housing is minimal, and the broader housing crisis is attributed to other factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:30">[03:32:30]</a>.
*   **Exploitation of Migrant Workers:** A significant problem is the exploitation and abuse of temporary migrants, particularly in low-skilled programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:03">[01:15:03]</a>. This includes wage theft and inadequate wage reimbursement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:07">[02:24:07]</a>. While policies like enabling migrants to change employers more easily and introducing criminal penalties for exploitation have been implemented, the criteria for conviction remain opaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:29">[02:25:29]</a>. Empowering unions to assist temporary migrants is suggested as a way to reduce exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:31">[02:27:31]</a>.
*   **Asylum Seeker Backlogs:** A "labor trafficking scam" that emerged around 2015-2016 led to a large backlog of asylum applications, many of which were opportunistic rather than genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:50">[02:10:50]</a>. This has resulted in around 100,000 individuals currently in Australia who have exhausted their visa options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:01">[02:20:01]</a>.
*   **"Invisible" Underclass:** There is a concern about creating a permanent underclass of exploited, undocumented people living in the shadows of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:55">[02:30:55]</a>. This is seen as undesirable for Australian society.

## Strategies and Policy Recommendations

### Addressing Asylum Backlogs
To address the backlog of refused asylum seekers, Abel Rizvi suggests:
*   **Slowing the application rate:** This involves adequately resourcing primary decision-makers to process applications quickly, preventing organizers from benefiting from work rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:14">[02:31:14]</a>.
*   **Prosecuting organizers:** Investing in investigating and prosecuting those who organize labor trafficking scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:16">[02:24:16]</a>.
*   **Pathway to permanent residence for long-term residents:** For the thousands of people who have been refused visas but remain in Australia, finding a "subtle way to give them a pathway to permanent residence" is proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:31">[02:37:31]</a>. This approach acknowledges the high cost and logistical challenges of mass deportations, drawing parallels to a "one November" category visa introduced in 1993 for Chinese students who were unlikely to return home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:07">[02:57:07]</a>.

### Managing International Student Intake
The expansion of international student intake has been a "stroke of Australian policy genius" for its multiple benefits, including slowing population aging, addressing skill shortages, and generating export income for universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>. To improve the system and reduce uncertainty, a standardized entrance exam for overseas students is proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:34">[03:17:34]</a>. This would replace the subjective "genuine student" criterion and offer a more efficient, objective, and fair process, providing students with certainty and enabling the government to control numbers more sensibly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:49">[03:55:49]</a>.

### Adapting Immigration Policy to Future Challenges
Australia's immigration policy is a crucial tool for managing population aging, with a target net migration level around 200,000-250,000 per year considered optimal for slowing the rate of aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:18">[04:21:18]</a>. However, this strategy faces future challenges as global demographics shift, and more countries will likely compete for young, skilled migrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:50">[04:39:50]</a>.

The call for an actual **population plan** is highlighted as a critical step forward, as Australia has never had one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. Such a plan would provide a comprehensive framework for future immigration policy.

### Cultural Integration and Policy
Abel Rizvi is reluctant to advocate for governments getting involved in dictating culture, preferring it to evolve naturally rather than be determined by politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>. He suggests that a country's culture naturally adopts habits and words from waves of migration, such as Italian food becoming popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>.

## International Comparisons: Japan and Canada
Australia's demographic trajectory contrasts sharply with Japan's, which is older and shrinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47">[04:47]</a>. Japanese policymakers are interested in Australia's Settlement Services to address their own challenges in integrating migrants into a largely monocultural society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. Japan is beginning to adopt similar policies, including points-tested and employer-sponsored categories, and exploring programs like Australia's adult migrant English program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>.

Canada, historically seen as a successful model for immigration management, has recently faced issues with its program getting "out of control," leading to a backlash and a deliberate policy to reduce population growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>. This illustrates the delicate balance required in managing immigration levels and public perception, a key aspect of [[issues_of_migration_control_and_public_perception | immigration challenges]].

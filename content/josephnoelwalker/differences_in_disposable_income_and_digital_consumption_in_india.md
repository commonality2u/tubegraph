Western venture capitalists often [[overestimation_of_the_indian_market_size_by_western_vcs | overestimate the size of the market]] in India for digital products and services [00:00:00]. This misconception arises partly due to the unique nature of [[indias_unique_digital_revolution_compared_to_the_developed_world | India's digital revolution]], which has unfolded in an "upside down" manner compared to the developed world [00:00:03].

## Unique Digital Landscape

In developed nations, digital revolutions occurred after a certain GDP per capita was achieved, allowing populations to afford phones, and infrastructure like fiber optic cables to be widely laid out [00:00:09]. In contrast, regions within India like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, even in their poorest parts, may have excellent internet connectivity but lack basic amenities like water [00:00:24].

## Overestimating Market Size

Common figures cited suggest India has 860 million people connected digitally via smartphones, with at least one per household [00:00:35]. This leads to projections, such as an edtech company potentially having a market size of 300 million people [00:00:50]. However, this is considered a significant overestimation [00:00:57].

The number of people in India who use the internet with comparable disposable income to consumers in the US is only about 25 to 30 million [00:01:02]. These are the individuals who can afford services like Netflix or Amazon subscriptions [00:01:10].

## The "Indus Valley Report" Perspective

Sajit Pai's "Indus Valley Report" offers a more grounded estimate, suggesting that the economically active digital market in India, which he terms "India A," is roughly the size of Taiwan [00:01:17]. The group that significantly spends on internet services is estimated to be around 200 million people, possibly even less [00:01:33]. The "next billion" users are not spending much money on these digital platforms [00:01:42].

## Misconceptions for Western Venture Capitalists

Western VCs often attempt to replicate business models successful in their own markets, such as DoorDash or Uber, for the Indian market [00:01:48]. They incorrectly assume that a large smartphone user base (e.g., 860 million in India compared to California's 38 million) translates directly into a similarly large addressable market [00:01:57]. In reality, these investments primarily target the "Taiwan that lives in India," a demographic smaller and poorer than California, highlighting a fundamental misunderstanding of the actual market's spending power [00:02:09].

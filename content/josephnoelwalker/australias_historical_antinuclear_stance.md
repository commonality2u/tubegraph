## Historical Context

Historically, [[Australias historical stance on nuclear weapons | Australia]] has seen significant anti-nuclear campaigns, particularly prevalent in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This historical sentiment led to an expectation that public opposition would intensify with the announcement of the [[implications_of_the_aukus_agreement_on_nuclear_power | AUKUS agreement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. However, this anticipated popular reaction, particularly against the idea of [[australia_and_nuclear_power | Australia]] birthing nuclear reactors, did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Recent Shifts in Public Opinion

A 2022 poll conducted by the Lowy Institute indicated a surprising shift in [[australian_public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons_acquisition | Australian public opinion on nuclear weapons acquisition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The poll revealed that approximately 36% of Australians either support or strongly support [[australian_public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons_acquisition | Australia]] acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This finding was unexpected given the country's anti-nuclear past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The absence of a strong popular backlash suggested that Australians might be more relaxed about [[australia_and_nuclear_power | nuclear power]] than previously assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Interpreting Poll Results

When interpreting results from polls like the [[nuclear_weapons_poll_in_australia | nuclear weapons poll in Australia]], it's important to consider that survey questions are typically presented without counterfactuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For instance, respondents are usually asked if they want [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons | nuclear weapons]] without being presented with potential costs or trade-offs, such as "if it costs this or if it means getting less of that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

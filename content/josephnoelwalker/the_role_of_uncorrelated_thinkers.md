From: [[josephnoelwalker]] <br/> 

An "uncorrelated thinker" is someone who forms their opinions and judgments independently, rather than conforming to established narratives or ideological tribes. Such thinkers are seen as crucial for navigating complex modern challenges and fostering genuine progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

## Characteristics of Uncorrelated Thinkers

*   **Independent Reasoning** Uncorrelated thinkers evaluate each issue on its own merits, rather than applying a pre-determined ideological lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>. They do not simply adopt a position by putting a minus sign in front of the consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.
*   **Courage** It takes courage to be a contrarian, likened to "holding on to a lump of glowing hot gold" and juggling it until it cools down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This courage is considered rarer than genius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Self-Awareness** An uncorrelated thinker maintains a healthy skepticism about their own sanity, constantly checking their perceptions and beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. The person who is not worried about whether they are crazy is the one to be concerned about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This constant self-correction makes them more reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **Unwavering Pursuit of Truth** They are committed to analytical correctness, even when it is "not politically smart" or challenges powerful figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>. They prioritize logic over emotional or political convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>.
*   **Adulthood in Thought** Uncorrelated thinkers embody "adulthood," recognizing the complexity of problems, the resources required, and the trade-offs involved in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>. They reject simplistic, tribalistic, or nostalgic views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>.

## Contrasting Thinking Styles

*   **Tribalism** The current political landscape often forces individuals to adopt a complete "package" of beliefs based on their tribe, where one's view on an issue can be predicted by their views on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>. This prevents nuanced understanding, such as supporting a political figure for tactical reasons without endorsing all their policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
*   **Conformity** The Asch conformity experiment illustrates how individuals often defy their own perceptions to align with a group's incorrect majority opinion due to reputational pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. Uncorrelated thinkers are less prone to this, as they can extract themselves from the illusion of group consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.
*   **Contradictory Thinking** Distinct from contrarians, contradictory thinkers constantly put a "minus sign in front of everything" without genuine independent thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:14">[00:57:14]</a>.
*   **Emotional vs. Rational Thinking** People often struggle to separate their analytical brain from their political or emotional brain, leading to logical inconsistencies and a reluctance to accept uncomfortable truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

## The Importance of Uncorrelated Thinkers

In a world facing unprecedented challenges, the need for uncorrelated thinkers is paramount:

*   **Addressing Existential Risks** The speaker argues that the world is in an "apocalyptic" state, with global threats like pandemics, social unrest, and nuclear risks requiring urgent, clear-headed responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This requires individuals capable of sober [[understanding_and_solving_technical_problems_in_research | understanding and solving technical problems]], rather than allowing emotional or political agendas to cloud judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.
*   **Combating Pervasive Fakery** Modern society is characterized by widespread institutional lying, "fake businesses," and "fake political agendas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. Uncorrelated thinkers operating outside traditional institutional structures, like long-form podcasters, are seen as a "bright spot" because they can speak truth to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.
*   **Driving Innovation and Growth** The stagnation of productivity since the 1970s is partly attributed to a lack of genuine innovation and an over-reliance on "faking everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. True progress requires identifying "new orchards" of opportunity and acting upon them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:53">[02:02:53]</a>.
*   **Navigating Complexity** The modern world is increasingly technical and complicated, demanding precise thinking rather than simple, emotional responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Uncorrelated thinkers provide the clarity needed to cut through the noise and make rational decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.
*   **Challenging Pathological Egalitarianism** While acknowledging issues of inequality, uncorrelated thinkers can critique the dangers of "pathological egalitarianism," which seeks to level all differences, often leading to violence and suppression of excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. They advocate for appreciating individual talent and expertise ("elitism" in the sense of merit, not inherited privilege) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   **Fostering Adulthood in Society** The absence of "adulthood" in leadership and public discourse contributes to the current crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>. Uncorrelated thinkers, who can articulate complex problems and trade-offs, are needed to guide society through the "rapids" of serious crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:11">[02:06:11]</a>.
*   **Promoting [[the_role_of_creativity_in_human_behavior_and_development | Creativity]]** Genuine [[the_role_of_creativity_in_human_behavior_and_development | creativity]] and innovation often come from "freaks and weirdos" or "remarkable individuals" who dare to think differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:43">[02:06:43]</a>.
*   **Diversifying Against Global Risks** In an interconnected world where a single global experiment (like humanity on Earth) risks complete collapse from systemic risks, uncorrelated thinkers are necessary to envision and pursue diversification, such as space colonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, despite seemingly insurmountable scientific limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:55">[01:48:55]</a>. This aligns with [[speculations_on_space_colonization_and_existential_risks | speculations on space colonization and existential risks]].

## Challenges Faced

*   **Misunderstanding and Condemnation** Uncorrelated thinkers often face instant condemnation for their views, regardless of nuance, as mainstream discourse is geared towards "cancellation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. They must constantly qualify their statements to avoid being misinterpreted or labeled negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.
*   **Lack of Institutional Support** Individuals capable of this independent thought often find no place within traditional institutional structures, which have become closed off to new entrants, especially younger generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>.
*   **"Motte and Bailey" Fallacy** Aggressive strategies, like the "intersectional shakedown" (accusing someone of "-ist" or "-phobic" behavior to force compliance), are counterproductive, leading to fake compliance rather than genuine progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>. Uncorrelated thinkers must resist such tactics while still addressing legitimate grievances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
*   **Mental Exhaustion** The constant need to explain nuanced positions and counter illogical arguments can be exhausting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.

Ultimately, the present challenges, like the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest, are seen as proof that society has graduated from old systems (capitalism, communism, religious beliefs, race) but is stuck in a state of arrested development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>. The hope for the future lies in the emergence of more "remarkable individuals" who can lead with genuine insight, rather than relying on collective action or outdated modes of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:43">[02:06:43]</a>.

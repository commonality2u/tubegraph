Securing research funding for novel scientific ideas, particularly in emerging fields like RNA biology, can present significant [[challenges_of_securing_research_grants | challenges]]. One researcher's early career at the University of Pennsylvania illustrates the difficulties faced when pursuing groundbreaking RNA research without established support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

During their non-tenure research assistant professor position, the researcher consistently applied for grants, submitting proposals monthly for the first two years, starting in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Despite the effort, none of these initial grant applications were successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Focus on Circular RNA and Rejections

A key area of proposed research involved the use of [[circular_rna_research_proposals_and_rejections | circular RNA]], a concept considered novel even in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. A specific grant proposal from 1992-1993 focusing on [[circular_rna_research_proposals_and_rejections | circular RNA]] was rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Reasons for Grant Rejection

The primary reasons cited for the rejection of these early RNA-focused proposals included:
*   Concerns about the [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | lability of RNA]], suggesting it might not be useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This often implies a lack of [[understanding_immune_response_to_rna | understanding immune response to RNA]] and its stability challenges.
*   Insufficient experimental data to support the proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   Direct questioning of the researcher's knowledge and expertise to carry out the proposed experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Researcher's Response and University Policy

Despite the setbacks, the researcher viewed the rejections as opportunities for improvement rather than dismissals of their ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. They recognized that the onus was on them to explain their ideas more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This led to efforts to [[understanding_and_solving_technical_problems_in_research | improve writing skills]], seek feedback from colleagues, and generate more supporting experimental data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

However, the University of Pennsylvania had a strict policy: faculty members in non-tenure positions had five years to secure funding and establish themselves, or they would face promotion or removal from the faculty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Due to the continued lack of funding for their RNA work, the researcher was ultimately removed from the faculty in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

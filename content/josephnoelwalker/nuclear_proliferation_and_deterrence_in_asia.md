Sam Rogavine, Director of the Lowy Institute's International Security Program, previously served as a senior analyst at Australia's Office of National Assessments (ONA), now the Office of National Intelligence (ONI). His work there focused on [[nuclear_proliferation_and_regional_security_dynamics_in_asia | North Asian nuclear strategy and military forces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

## Intelligence and Strategic Assessment

Rogavine suggests that for long-term international issues, including the rise of China and American decline, access to classified intelligence holds "negligible value," or "almost zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. He argues that the quality of open-source analysis is comparable to what is produced within intelligence agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. The primary advantage of intelligence agencies lies in short-term assessments, such as briefing ministers for international conferences or bilateral negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

The information environment has shifted from scarcity to "super abundance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>, posing an existential problem for the intelligence world. Espionage, originally a rational response to information deficits, is less relevant when the challenge is managing overwhelming information rather than unveiling new secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. Intelligence agencies, driven by self-interest, continue to emphasize secret intelligence as it's an "easier problem to solve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. This is framed as focusing on "puzzles" (knowable facts, like how many [[nuclear_proliferation_and_regional_security_dynamics_in_asia | nuclear weapons]] North Korea possesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>) rather than "mysteries" (unknowable intentions, like what North Korea wants to do with its nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.

## US Strategic Future in Asia

Rogavine discusses three potential paths for America's strategic future in Asia:
1.  **America fights China for dominance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. This is seen as driven by America's self-image as the leading power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. However, for the US to convince China of its seriousness, it would require a "whole of nation effort" larger than the Cold War, including a presidential declaration making it a national mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>. Current US defense spending trends downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>.
2.  **America enters a power-sharing relationship with China** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. Rogavine believes this "middle scenario" will last for a "long interregnum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>. Bureaucratic barriers to US withdrawal are high, and incentives for withdrawal are low, but equally, incentives for rapidly increasing American force are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. This means America's relative decline continues as China's defense spending grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a>. While the prospect of a Trump administration could accelerate withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>, Trump's lack of talent and bureaucratic backing in his first term limited his ability to enact his vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>.
3.  **America leaves the region entirely** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. While this is Hugh White's view, Rogavine argues that the difference for China between a reduced US presence and a full withdrawal is not significant enough to risk confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:20:00">[24:20:00]</a>. Also, allies like Japan and South Korea desperately want the US to stay to avoid having to dramatically increase their defense spending or acquire their own [[nuclear_proliferation_and_regional_security_dynamics_in_asia | nuclear weapons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>.

A US presence, even in a power-sharing capacity, preoccupies China more than complete absence, requiring China to devote more resources to its relationship with the US and dealing with potential [[nuclear_proliferation_and_regional_security_dynamics_in_asia | proliferation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>.

## The Akidna Strategy for Australia

The "akidna strategy" proposes that Australia become "spiky but not threatening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, exploiting its geographic distance from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This strategy asserts Australia can defend itself without significantly increasing defense spending as a percentage of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

### Akidna and Nuclear Capabilities

Australia's acquisition of eight [[implications_of_the_aukus_agreement_on_nuclear_power | nuclear-powered submarines]] through AUKUS is considered provocative to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:58:00">[27:58:00]</a>. Adding these submarines significantly boosts America's seaborn deterrent. These submarines can carry cruise missiles capable of hitting targets on the Chinese landmass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:24:00">[29:24:00]</a>. Furthermore, nuclear-powered submarines are effective at finding, chasing, and destroying ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), making Australia an "additional threat to China's nuclear deterrent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39:00">[29:39:00]</a>.

The mission of hunting SSBNs, known as strategic ASW (anti-submarine warfare), is highly sensitive and typically not subcontracted by the US to allies that are not themselves nuclear powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:53:00">[31:53:00]</a>. However, Australia's possession of such submarines frees up US assets for this strategic mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:45:00">[32:45:00]</a>.

The akidna strategy draws comfort from the "defensive dominance" era in military technology, where defensive costs are lower than offensive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:00">[33:01:00]</a>. The Ukraine war, where Ukraine (without a navy) is sinking Russian surface combatants using drones and anti-shipping missiles, supports this argument by showing large surface ships are increasingly vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:54:00">[33:54:00]</a>. Projecting significant military power against Australia requires sending ships or aircraft, which can be countered by capabilities to sink ships and shoot down planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:56:00">[34:56:00]</a>. The main concern for the defensive balance would be if it became much cheaper and easier to shoot down missiles and drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:42:00">[35:42:00]</a>.

### Akidna Force Structure

While Australia currently has six conventionally powered Collins-class submarines and aims for eight nuclear-powered submarines with AUKUS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:57:00">[37:57:00]</a>, the optimal number of submarines under an akidna strategy is not fixed. The focus should be on the *function* of sinking ships and other submarines, which can also be achieved through maritime patrol aircraft, fast jets, some surface ships, and land-based anti-ship weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:19:00">[40:19:00]</a>.

### Alliance with Indonesia

A top priority for Australian statecraft should be an alliance with Indonesia, even if not formally defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:22:00">[41:22:00]</a>. Distance is Australia's greatest defense asset, but this advantage does not apply to Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:50:00">[41:50:00]</a>. Indonesia is projected to become the world's fourth-largest economy by 2045 and a great power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:32:00">[42:32:00]</a>. For Australia, an Indonesia that is wealthy and hostile would be the "worst outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:52:00">[43:52:00]</a>.

An alliance with Indonesia should have "purely and narrowly defensive ambitions that are only solely maritime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:03:00">[47:03:00]</a>. It would not involve power projection onto the landmass of any country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:40:00">[47:40:00]</a>. This approach aims to communicate to potential adversaries that the intent is only defensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:37:00">[48:37:00]</a>.

The success of such an alliance largely depends on Indonesia's side, as its strategic community is small and historically focused internally rather than south towards Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:33:00">[52:33:00]</a>. China's growing ambitions in Southeast Asia may eventually force Indonesia to make hard choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:53:00">[50:53:00]</a>. While Australia's military capabilities could offer value, Indonesia's low state capacity and halting progress in defense modernization mean this window of opportunity is not closing quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:42:00">[54:42:00]</a>.

## Australia and Nuclear Weapons

A 2022 Lowy Institute [[nuclear_weapons_poll_in_australia | poll in Australia]] showed that about 36% of Australians either support or strongly support Australia acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:48:00">[56:48:00]</a>. This surprising result, according to Rogavine, may be due to Australians being more relaxed about [[australia_and_nuclear_power | nuclear power]] following the AUKUS announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:05:00">[57:05:00]</a>. He attributes the poll results to [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons | poll questions]] that don't present counterfactuals or costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:42:00">[58:42:00]</a>.

Rogavine believes Australia would only consider acquiring [[nuclear_proliferation_and_regional_security_dynamics_in_asia | nuclear weapons]] if other regional powers, specifically Japan and South Korea, went nuclear first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:35:00">[59:35:00]</a>. Taiwan is unlikely to go nuclear due to the difficulty of keeping such a program secret and the risk of immediate Chinese invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21:00">[01:00:21:00]</a>. A crucial precondition for Australia's nuclear consideration would be Indonesian acquiescence or, preferably, cooperation, to avoid creating worse security problems with Indonesia than those being solved with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17:00">[01:01:17:00]</a>.

### Credibility of Extended Nuclear Deterrence

The [[credibility_of_american_extended_nuclear_deterrence | credibility of American extended nuclear deterrence]] is waning, especially with the development of North Korean intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of hitting US cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41:00">[01:03:41:00]</a>. The bargain that the US will use its nuclear weapons in an ally's defense, even if it means sacrificing an American city, is "not credible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07:00">[01:04:07:00]</a>. This is a cold-blooded assessment of vital interests, not a judgment on American courage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49:00">[01:04:49:00]</a>. South Korea is drawing this conclusion and developing independent capabilities, while Australia and Japan are tying themselves more closely to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30:00">[01:05:30:00]</a>.

### Nuclear Blackmail and Taboo

Rogavine argues that Australia can call China's bluff if threatened with [[nuclear_blackmail_and_its_impact_on_international_relations | nuclear blackmail]] because he believes China would never actually use [[nuclear_proliferation_and_regional_security_dynamics_in_asia | nuclear weapons]] against Australia due to the "incredibly high" cultural taboo against nuclear use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42:00">[01:09:42:00]</a>. However, [[nuclear_blackmail_and_its_impact_on_international_relations | nuclear blackmail]] is effective only if the threat is believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09:00">[01:12:09:00]</a>. While the consequences of nuclear use are immense, the cost of Australia acquiring its own nuclear weapons is also huge, requiring a weighing of costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50:00">[01:12:50:00]</a>. Historical examples like Russia's nuclear threats against NATO in Ukraine or the US using nuclear threats to deter China from invading Taiwan in the 1950s demonstrate the effectiveness of [[nuclear_blackmail_and_its_impact_on_international_relations | nuclear blackmail]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:53:00">[01:10:53:00]</a>.

### The Future of Australia's Security Narrative

Australia has a historical "fear of abandonment" in its defense and foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22:00">[01:13:22:00]</a>. However, Australia is being transformed by Asian immigration and its economy is now Asia-focused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13:00">[01:14:13:00]</a>. Rogavine suggests that defense policy, particularly the AUKUS arrangement, goes "against the grain" of Australia's post-war trend of integrating with Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07:00">[01:15:07:00]</a>. He offers optimism that the steady relative decline of American power in Asia and shocks like the Trump administration will "force Australia to be more free," leading to a more confident and independent nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46:00">[01:15:46:00]</a>. This shift would mean less reliance on being US-dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29:00">[01:21:29:00]</a>.

Rogavine desires Australia to be an "ambitious nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:48:00">[01:20:48:00]</a>, not in defense policy but as a "beacon" of liberal democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, with ambition directed towards population and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52:00">[01:22:52:00]</a>.

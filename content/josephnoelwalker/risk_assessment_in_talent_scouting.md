When identifying promising talent, especially in early stages, assessing the level of risk in chosen projects is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A key insight suggests that a lack of failure might indicate insufficient risk-taking, rather than perfect success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Tyler Cowen's Perspective on Risk

Early in a period of selecting "India winners," [[tyler_cowens_perspective_on_risktaking | Tyler Cowen]] questioned the talent scout's approach: "Your India winners are great, they're all succeeding. Are you taking enough risk? Where's the [[importance_of_failure_rate_in_talent_selection | failure rate]]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> This question was unique, as typically, if things are going well, they are left alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Evaluating Rejected Candidates

Prompted by this question, the talent scout initiated an [[evaluation_of_rejected_candidates | evaluation of rejected candidates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The goal was to determine if rejections were due to projects being excessively risky or "out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Reasons for Rejection

Surprisingly, the assessment revealed that none of the rejections at that time were due to the inherent riskiness of a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Instead, rejections often stemmed from:
*   The applicant not having a well-developed idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   The project not being risky *enough*, often described as "too cookie-cutter" or "boring," raising the question of its necessity in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

This [[evaluation_of_rejected_candidates | re-evaluation]] brought comfort regarding the level of risk being taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Continuous Reevaluation

The practice of reviewing rejections is highly recommended for new talent scouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Regularly, perhaps every six months, one should revisit past rejections to consider if the initial decision was correct, understand the rationale at the time, and assess if that perspective still holds after more grant selections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This [[importance_of_reevaluation_in_project_selection | ongoing reevaluation]] helps refine decision-making in talent scouting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

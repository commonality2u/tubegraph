Laura Deming is a prominent figure in the field of [[communicating_and_investing_in_longevity_science | life extension technologies]], serving as a venture capitalist focused on anti-aging and life extension. She co-founded the Longevity Fund, which has since been succeeded by Age One, where she is also a co-founder and partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Deming is also the co-founder and CEO of Cradle, a startup dedicated to human whole-body reversible [[cryopreservation_and_its_applications | cryopreservation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Philosophical and Sociopolitical Context of Longevity

The discussion of [[philosophical_implications_of_longevity | longevity]] often begins with questions of [[transhumanism_and_personal_identity | personal identity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Laura Deming emphasizes that the core question for the next century of [[transhumanism_and_personal_identity | transhumanism]] and human-interaction technology is subjective: "what do you want to preserve over time?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. There is no universally "correct" answer from either Eastern or Western philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Deming believes these philosophical debates already influence how capital is allocated in a subconscious way, as people's unexamined beliefs guide investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Currently, a conservative perspective favoring physical continuity and preserving the "physical self" for as long as possible seems to prevail in Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. However, deep reflection, similar to Buddhist "no-self" meditations, can lead to the realization that physical continuity is hard to defend conceptually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Despite this, Deming maintains that it is "extremely incorrect not to work on longevity drugs" because they are simply a type of medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

The concept of a "more humane [[transhumanism_and_personal_identity | transhumanism]]" for Deming implies a shift away from a focus on gaining power and the drive to survive, which she finds incomplete and uninspiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>. She is more interested in unpredictable population-level changes rather than predictable individual changes in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a>.

### Impact of Extended Lifespans on Society

If human lifespans were to extend to 150-200 years, several non-obvious societal changes could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>:

*   **Artistic and Intellectual Evolution**: Extended lifespans could lead to unprecedented depths of creativity and evolution in conscious entities, as exemplified by Hokusai, the artist of "The Great Wave of Kanagawa," who felt he was only beginning to learn to draw at 60 or 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:24">[01:19:24]</a>. This long-term evolution could yield beauty not seen with shorter lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>.
*   **Game Theory and Cooperation**: In game theory, an unknown or very long number of rounds incentivizes cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>. Extended lifespans in society might lead to more pro-social behavior, although this is not empirically certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:38">[02:12:38]</a>.
*   **Economic Inequality**: A significant negative aspect is the potential for increased inequality, where being born earlier (and thus having more time to compound capital) becomes a major advantage, potentially replacing youth as an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:57">[02:21:57]</a>. This might necessitate new societal structures for wealth taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:31">[02:32:31]</a>.
*   **Societal Dynamism**: There's a concern that extended lifespans might lead to a less dynamic society if individuals maintain worldview influenced by their youth and there's less turnover in positions of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:10">[02:26:10]</a>. However, Deming argues that modern society already demonstrates change, as seen in evolving cultural tastes like music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:09">[02:51:09]</a>.

## Scientific Approaches to Life Extension

### Theories of Aging
Deming notes that aging is both a complex phenomenon and, surprisingly, can be influenced by simple changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>. It is a "strange but true fact" that single gene changes in many organisms can significantly alter lifespan, sometimes by an "insane multiple" in small organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>. While the default assumption is that aging is a system breaking down randomly, there's a non-zero component that can be controlled, at least in non-human organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.

Examples of lifespan extension in model organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>:
*   **C. elegans (worms)**: Interventions can increase lifespan by up to sixfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
*   **Mice**: Interventions can lead to roughly a 60% increase in lifespan, or even higher, though questions remain about whether these mice are representative of healthy human populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>.

Deming finds it "incredibly strange" that simple changes can have such a profound impact on complex biological systems, which are composed of trillions of atoms interacting in intricate ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:20">[00:59:20]</a>.

### Regulatory Hurdles for Longevity Drugs
A key challenge for longevity drugs is the regulatory landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23">[01:01:23]</a>. If she were FDA commissioner, Deming would:
1.  **Establish Aging as an Indication**: Lay the groundwork for aging to be recognized as a treatable condition, simplifying the conceptualization of longevity drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:57">[01:30:57]</a>.
2.  **Shorten Review Cycles**: Reduce preclinical review cycles from six months to ideally a couple of weeks, to accelerate the iteration process for companies while maintaining safety and effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>.

### Investment Patterns in Longevity
The Longevity Fund initially focused on "conservative" biotech companies with links to aging, to provide understandable examples for the biotech field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:18">[01:03:18]</a>. Over time, it became clear that the most successful companies in their portfolio were "founder-oriented companies going after actual moonshot ideas" from early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>.

## Cryopreservation: A Strategic Focus
Laura Deming chose [[cryopreservation_and_its_applications | cryopreservation]] as her personal focus due to its unique characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>:

*   **Impactful**: Successfully solving [[cryopreservation_techniques | medical hibernation]] could allow individuals with terminal illnesses to pause their biological time and wait for future therapies, effectively bridging the gap to life-saving medical advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>.
*   **Technically Tractable**: Although experimental, [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreservation]] allows for deep integration of engineering and physics, offering significant leverage for developing new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>.
*   **Underworked**: Compared to its potential impact and technical solvability, [[cryopreservation_and_its_applications | cryopreservation]] is significantly underworked, largely due to its "weirdness" and the "baggage" or "force field" of intuitions and negative perceptions surrounding the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>.

### Principles of Cryopreservation
Deming emphasizes the strange yet fundamental principle underlying [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreservation]]: cells operate on "passive diffusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:18">[01:44:18]</a>. Unlike human-designed systems that are not invariant to randomization, cells are evolved to function amidst high thermal noise and molecular randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:51">[01:43:51]</a>. This inherent property makes them robust to the molecular randomization that occurs during extreme cooling below -130Â°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:51">[01:41:51]</a>. This understanding highlights why [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreservation]] is even possible, as cells are designed to tolerate the molecular "shaking" that freezing induces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:43">[01:44:43]</a>.

### Tractability Compared to Other Interventions
[[Cryopreservation_and_its_applications | Cryopreservation]] (pausing) is considered more tractable as a single, fully defined problem compared to other categories of aging interventions (restoring, replacing, delaying) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>. Its defined nature and the ability to plug in tools from physics and engineering give it significant leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>.

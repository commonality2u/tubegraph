From: [[josephnoelwalker]] <br/> 
The [[Selfish Gene Theory and Evolutionary Biology | selfish gene theory]], first introduced by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book *The Selfish Gene*, posits that organisms are "survival machines robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. This perspective, described by Randolph Nesse as one of the most disturbing discoveries in the history of science, suggests that altruistic tendencies are shaped by benefits to genes, a realization that can be intellectually unsettling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.

### Early Encounter with Gene-Centered Evolution
Matt Ridley, who studied zoology at Oxford, encountered Dawkins's *The Selfish Gene* during his first term in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:01">[01:55:01]</a>. The book struck him "like a thunderbolt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:01">[02:21:01]</a>. Beyond its core theory, it revealed that science is an unfinished masterpiece, a search for new mysteries rather than a catalog of facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:01">[02:31:01]</a>.

The gene-centered view helps explain common behaviors, such as why people are generally kinder to their relatives, especially their children, than to strangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:01">[03:30:01]</a>. This seemingly "weird" obsession with kin is explained by the fact that individuals who were nice to their children had more children survive, leading to the selection of genes that promote such behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:01">[04:14:01]</a>.

### Connecting Biological Evolution to Innovation
Ridley argues for a direct continuum between biological evolution and technological innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:01">[08:09:01]</a>. Both processes, when viewed from a distance, represent "reverse local reversals of entropy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:01">[08:27:01]</a>, creating improbable order using energy to build useful structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:01">[08:31:01]</a>. Analogies can be drawn between a termite's nest or a bird's nest and a skyscraper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:01">[08:51:01]</a>. Just as a jellyfish's body is built by its genes to capture energy and create order, a skyscraper or a car is a creation of order (for living or moving) through the use of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:01">[09:03:01]</a>. Thus, technological innovation is seen as a direct next step in evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:01">[09:37:01]</a>.

#### Innovation as Natural Selection
Innovations, like biological traits, come into the world through a process of trial and error, akin to natural selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:01">[09:49:01]</a>. Ideas are put forth, and some survive while others do not, based on their utility and adoption (e.g., Google Glass versus iPhone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:01">[09:59:01]</a>.

Even complex designs, like airplanes, are not products of isolated "intelligent design" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:01">[10:25:01]</a>. Instead, they evolve from previous designs through iterative adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:01">[10:38:01]</a>. Bad ideas (e.g., designs leading to crashes or being uneconomic) are deselected, while good ideas survive, demonstrating "survival of the fittest" in action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:01">[10:50:01]</a>. A specific example is the change from square airplane windows to rounded ones, a design evolution driven by the catastrophic failures caused by metal fatigue at corners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:01">[11:08:01]</a>.

#### The "Infinite Improbability Drive"
Innovation, as described by Ridley, is "humanity's infinite improbability drive," a concept borrowed from Douglas Adams's *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:01">[12:36:01]</a>. This refers to the creation of highly improbable, useful structures that could not arise naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:01">[13:10:01]</a>. An iPhone, for instance, is an incredibly improbable arrangement of atoms that requires significant energy input to create, moving away from thermodynamic equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:01">[13:50:01]</a>. This process was profoundly accelerated over the last 300 years by the innovation of harnessing energy (e.g., steam engine, fossil fuels, nuclear power), which fueled the industrial revolution and its successors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:01">[14:23:01]</a>.

#### Invention vs. Innovation
Ridley distinguishes invention from innovation:
*   **Invention** is the creation of a new prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:01">[15:24:01]</a>.
*   **Innovation** is the process of making that invention affordable, reliable, and available to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:01">[15:28:01]</a>.
He uses the anecdote of a beaver looking at the Hoover Dam, saying, "I didn't build it but it is based on an idea of mine," to illustrate the difference between inventor and innovator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:01">[15:43:01]</a>. Jeff Bezos, as the builder of Amazon, is an innovator rather than an inventor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:01">[16:01:01]</a>.

#### Challenging the "Great Man" Theory
The common story of innovation often centers on a clever, isolated individual having a "eureka" moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:01">[17:13:01]</a>. Ridley contends that this is misleading because:
1.  **Innovators don't have to be uniquely clever**: Most great innovators work "darned hard," conduct endless experiments, and persevere through failures, as seen with the Wright brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:01">[17:42:01]</a>.
2.  **Innovation is not easy after the prototype**: Turning an initial idea into a practical, marketable product requires enormous effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:01">[18:31:01]</a>. Thomas Edison, for example, is famous not just for inventing the light bulb (which many others also did), but for the "long hard slog" of experimentation to make it long-lasting and reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:01">[18:48:01]</a>.

While heroic narratives can inspire, they can also misrepresent the process, making creativity seem like a "special gift from the gods" and deterring potential entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:01">[24:50:01]</a>. Ridley argues that many significant innovations (like the search engine) were inevitable, and if specific "heroes" hadn't existed, others would have filled the void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:01">[22:45:01]</a>.

#### Collaboration and Serendipity
Collaboration and the free exchange of ideas are crucial to innovation. Historically, innovation has thrived in places where people meet and interact, such as trading city-states and cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:01">[26:50:01]</a>. Immigrants also bring new ideas that foster innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:01">[27:10:01]</a>.

The "pill camera," for instance, arose from a serendipitous conversation between a gastroenterologist and a guided missile designer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:32:01">[27:32:01]</a>. Many solutions to complex problems, even via platforms like Innocentive, come from people *outside* the specific field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:01">[27:51:01]</a>. The longitude prize in the 1700s was solved by a clockmaker, not an astronomer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:25:01">[28:25:01]</a>. Accidental discoveries (like Teflon, Kevlar, and the Post-it Note) further highlight the role of serendipity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:13:01">[29:13:01]</a>.

The invention of the computer is a prime example of a collaborative event that cannot be attributed to a single "hero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:01">[29:32:01]</a>. It involved a synthesis of ideas from various individuals and institutions (e.g., Alan Turing's theoretical concepts, IBM's calculators, Claude Shannon's logic, and practical builders in Germany, Iowa, Harvard, and Philadelphia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:01">[29:50:01]</a>. Wartime secrecy, by limiting communication, may have even slowed its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:17:01">[31:17:01]</a>.

#### Freedom and Innovation
Freedom is considered "the parent of innovation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07:01">[32:07:01]</a>. This encompasses not only the freedom to collaborate and express ideas but also economic freedom.

While some societies not known for political freedom (e.g., Singapore and China) have shown innovation, Ridley argues that China's innovation surge was primarily due to spectacular economic freedom, which allowed entrepreneurs to build, sell, and market without the detailed regulatory structure found in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:55:01">[32:55:01]</a>. However, he believes the more recent tightening of economic control under Xi Jinping, reminiscent of the Ming dynasty's centralized planning that stifled earlier Chinese innovation, will likely bring this to a "shuddering halt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:19:01">[34:19:01]</a>.

Fragmented political systems, like the US federal system or historical European city-states, also foster innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:01">[38:00:01]</a>. This is because innovators can "shop around" for regimes that are more congenial to their work, creating competition among jurisdictions to attract talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:13:01">[38:13:01]</a>.

#### Monopoly and Innovation
A key concern is whether unfettered economic freedom inevitably leads to monopolies that undermine innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:58:01">[41:58:01]</a>. Ridley agrees that big companies can be bad at innovation and may not see disruptive technologies coming, as highlighted by Clayton Christensen's *Innovator's Dilemma* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:42:01">[42:42:01]</a>. Examples include Kodak failing to embrace digital photography despite inventing it, and Nokia's inability to adapt to data-focused mobile phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:05:01">[48:05:01]</a>.

Monopolies can also entrench their incumbency by lobbying for regulations that act as barriers to entry for new competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:57:01">[44:57:01]</a>. The GDPR in Europe, for instance, is cited as a regulation that disproportionately benefited large tech incumbents by increasing compliance costs for smaller players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:43:01">[46:43:01]</a>. While this "crony capitalism" is a problem, Ridley argues that if big companies' power to appeal to government for self-serving regulation were removed, market freedom would not necessarily lead to innovation-crushing monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:41:01">[47:41:01]</a>. He views government itself as the ultimate monopoly that needs to be scrutinized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:42:01">[50:42:01]</a>.

However, the phenomenon of large tech companies acquiring and subsequently shutting down nascent competitors remains a disturbing counter-argument to the idea that big companies will naturally fail to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:36:01">[51:36:01]</a>.

#### Uncertainty and Enterprise
Innovation thrives on uncertainty, a concept elaborated by Frank Knight and John Maynard Keynes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:13:01">[57:13:01]</a>. Profit is seen as the entrepreneur's reward for venturing into uncertainty, driving technical and economic progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:19:01">[58:19:01]</a>. The "animal spirits" and spontaneous optimism are essential, as relying solely on mathematical expectation would cause enterprise to "fade and die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:48:01">[58:48:01]</a>.

A key ingredient for entrepreneurs is a preparedness to risk failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:44:01">[59:44:01]</a>. Making failure too expensive would stifle entrepreneurial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:53:01">[59:53:01]</a>. Innovators often undertake projects with extreme uncertainty about success, as exemplified by the Wright brothers' development of powered flight or Marconi's wireless telegraphy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37:01">[01:00:37:01]</a>. Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch's development of nitrogen fixation also demonstrated immense uncertainty and risk, with exploding experimental devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53:01">[01:01:53:01]</a>. This highlights that "uncertainty" is almost too mild a term for the risks involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45:01">[01:01:45:01]</a>.

Entrepreneurs sometimes engage in "fake it till you make it" strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56:01">[01:04:56:01]</a>. While this can work in fields like software (where Moore's Law often delivers increasing reliability and cost reduction), it's riskier in areas like biotechnology, as illustrated by the Theranos case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01:01">[01:05:01:01]</a>.

#### Innovation Famine and Outlook
There is a debate about whether the West is experiencing a "great stagnation" in innovation, particularly in "atoms" (material things) as opposed to "bits" (digital technologies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09:01">[01:19:09:01]</a>. While overall GDP per capita has continued to rise, other metrics like median male income have flatlined, and family size has shrunk, complicating simple comparisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14:01">[01:18:14:01]</a>.

Ridley agrees that innovation, particularly in material goods, has not reached its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:51:01">[01:20:51:01]</a>. He points to the difficulty in licensing new medical devices and the general "empire building by bureaucrats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:58:01">[01:20:58:01]</a>. Europe, for example, struggles to produce digital giants, and the turnover of companies in major indices has slowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:35:01">[01:21:35:01]</a>. The age of startup founders has also increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:57:01">[01:21:57:01]</a>.

Areas like new nuclear power designs and agricultural biotechnology (e.g., Golden Rice) are examples where innovation is deliberately stifled by regulatory hurdles, public pressure, and vested interests, not physical limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:12:01">[01:29:12:01]</a>. The slow pace of vaccine development, taking years and often failing, is another concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37:01">[01:22:37:01]</a>.

However, Ridley maintains a degree of optimism. He believes that despite obstacles, innovation tends to find a way, even if it requires societies to eventually realize the benefits of new technologies that have been suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05:01">[01:32:05:01]</a>. While civilizations have turned their backs on innovation in the past (e.g., Arabian Enlightenment, Ming China, Christian takeover of Roman Empire), he finds it hard to believe it could happen on a global scale indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:18:01">[01:33:18:01]</a>.

#### Path Dependency
Innovation is "path dependent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>, meaning one cannot simply jump ahead. There are sequential stages that must be developed and tested, like the miniaturization phases in microchip technology (Moore's Law) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:36:01">[01:33:36:01]</a>. This is akin to biological [[cellular_properties_and_evolution | evolution]], which cannot just "invent a wing" but must develop intermediate stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:46:01">[01:44:46:01]</a>. Similarly, the light bulb required reliable electricity, which in turn required an understanding of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01">[01:47:01]</a>. On a social level, the limited company evolved from earlier forms like chartered monopolies and merchant guilds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:53:01">[01:47:53:01]</a>. This accumulation of "civilizational intellectual capital" is crucial for new innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:01">[01:53:01]</a>.

The "Great Stagnation" refers to a period in the Western world, beginning around 1973, where productivity rates of growth slowed down significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Since this breakpoint, wages have increased more slowly or not at all, and science itself, outside of the tech sector, appears to have decelerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Innovation also seems to have slowed down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. These simultaneous trends have largely remained in place, resulting in lower living standards than would have been achieved had the previous higher rates of economic growth continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Origins and Causes
The precise reason for the 1973 breakpoint remains one of the great mysteries in modern economic history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. An immediate shock was the oil price shock of that year, which negatively impacted economies and productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. However, productivity did not fully recover even after oil prices later fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

Possible broader contributing factors include:
*   Increased societal regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   Greater risk aversion among people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   More "veto points" in decision-making processes across Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

The great stagnation is not technically "over-determined" but is rather the result of at least five or six contributing causes that pile on top of each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

## Measuring the End of Stagnation
A clear indicator of the end of the great stagnation would be consistently rising real wages for most income classes over a period of five to ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. In addition to wage growth, one would also need to observe progress in [[technological_revolutions_and_economic_growth | science and technology]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. While the great stagnation currently persists by the wage metric, there have been brief periods of robust wage increases in the United States, and longer periods in Australia and Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. However, growth in Australia and Canada has been attributed more to selling resources to China rather than [[technological_revolutions_and_economic_growth | technological]] breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

### Are We on the Cusp of Leaving Stagnation?
There is a possibility that the great stagnation is currently ending, though the COVID-19 pandemic may be obscuring this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Recent developments such as SpaceX, advancements in biomedicine, the rapid development of vaccines, and progress in solar power and battery prices suggest potential for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## Science, Technology, and Ideas
The distinction between science and [[technological_revolutions_and_economic_growth | technology]] is not always clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. In some cases, like quantum mechanics leading to computer advances, science clearly came first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. However, in areas like social media algorithms, machine learning, and [[ais_role_in_developing_countries_economic_growth | artificial intelligence]], [[technological_revolutions_and_economic_growth | technology]] and science are often the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

Metrics generally indicate a slowdown in science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. For example, Moore's Law is harder to maintain, crop yields are growing at diminishing rates, and more scientists are required to achieve a given amount of advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. One notable exception to this slowdown is the phenomenal speed of COVID-19 vaccine development, which suggests science may finally be speeding up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

## Societal and Political Impacts
A prolonged great stagnation raises concerns beyond just missing out on higher growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. It could lead Western societies to shift from a positive-sum to a zero-sum or even negative-sum mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This shift is already evident in many economies, which are shrinking, and in increasingly "nasty" politics where people fight over "scraps at the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. Historical periods before the industrial revolution, when land was the primary finite resource, also exhibited zero-sum thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. The emergence of liberalism and the industrial revolution in England and Northwestern Europe are linked, as they created a surplus that fostered consensus in democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.

The concept of secular stagnation, revived by Larry Summers, attributes the slowdown to a demand-side issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>. However, the opposing view is that this is a supply-side problem, and that merely increasing spending through a "binge" would not resolve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>. Growing private debt, which transfers income from borrowers to savers, is not seen as the cause of falling demand, as savers tend to have a higher marginal propensity to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.

## Connection to Housing Bubbles
The great stagnation is partially linked to housing bubbles, particularly those in the Anglosphere during the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. As income growth slowed, policymakers were incentivized to "juice up" credit and stimulate the housing market, contributing to real estate bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. The belief that economic growth would sustain high prices also played a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

Despite the housing panic of 2007-2008, the valuation of homes across the US has since surpassed its 2006 peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>. This suggests that while some regional markets experienced true bubbles, the national market's downturn was more of an "anti-bubble" panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:53">[00:45:53]</a>. The panic was caused by fears of a banking system collapse, which ultimately did not materialize due to stabilizing actions by the Federal Reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>. While over-lending to uncreditworthy individuals certainly occurred in some areas, the overall national real estate values were not "insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.

The political importance of housing prices is evident in Australia, where politicians noted a lack of public anger over increasing house values, and lending to investors surged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>. Despite 25 years of predictions of an Australian housing bubble, the country's strong fundamentals, large land area, and potential for [[the_relationship_between_immigration_housing_and_economic_growth | immigration]] suggest a robust market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The "Great Stagnation" framework suggests that society should prioritize growth maximization to improve the remaining time humanity has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>. Stronger social capital among less educated classes, a realistic view of America's standing, and a better strategy for dealing with China are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:14">[01:25:14]</a>. The US also needs freer markets, less government regulation in most areas, and a greater willingness to learn from other cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:36">[01:25:36]</a>.

Mark Cuban's perspective on US politics highlights issues within the current system and suggests reforms focused on representation and a bottom-up societal approach.

## Model of Donald Trump

Mark Cuban characterizes [[donald_trump | Donald Trump]] as a "fun guy to talk to" but notes a lack of self-awareness and an "always selling" demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>. He perceives Trump as "not very bright" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>.

Cuban recounts a specific anecdote from a 2001 Super Bowl party at Mar-a-Lago, where Trump told him, "mark someday you'll be able to sit up there with the rich people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>. Later, during a visit to Trump Tower, Cuban observed that Trump's office walls were entirely covered with pictures of himself, sometimes with others, sometimes on magazine covers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. He noted that Trump does not send emails personally; instead, his assistants scan handwritten notes and send them as PDF attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.

## Predicament of the White Working Class

Cuban refers to a book he read in high school, "Why Men Rebel," which suggests that people rebel when the disparity between their life expectations and reality becomes too wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>. In this context, when a figure offers hope and appears to understand their plight or be "one of us," people may disregard others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. He states that [[donald_trump | Donald Trump]] did not initiate a movement but rather "found a movement that was already there, waiting to be picked up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.

## Need for Empathy and Listening

Cuban emphasizes the critical need for politicians to listen to and engage with people who hold different views, even those who might express "hate" or strong disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. He believes that people fundamentally desire commonality rather than conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. Listening fosters trust, which in turn allows for understanding and potentially addressing their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.

## Challenges of the US Political System

Cuban identifies several systemic issues in the US political landscape:
*   **Primary System:** The primary election system incentivizes politicians to "pander to those most extreme people" because these individuals are more likely to vote in primaries and provide campaign funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>. This dynamic "feeds on it off itself," creating a cycle of partisanship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
*   **Duopoly of Parties:** The two-party system (Republicans and Democrats) creates ongoing challenges because it forces politicians into monolithic thought processes, even when their constituents' interests diverge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>. He questions the necessity of parties at all, suggesting they once served functions like communication and fundraising that are now digitally accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>.

## Proposed Reforms

Cuban suggests several reforms to address these challenges:

### Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)
Cuban is a proponent of ranked choice voting, similar to Australia's system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. He argues that RCV mitigates the need for candidates to "pander to a small group of people" in primaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>. It also eliminates the concern that third-party or independent candidates might "pull votes away" from a major party candidate, as voters can rank their preferences without fear of "spoiling" an election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>.

### Support for Independent Candidates
Rather than trying to create a third political party, which he believes would eventually face internal power dynamics similar to existing parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>, Cuban advocates for supporting independent candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>. He supports groups like the Center for Competitive Democracy in the US, which sues states and municipalities that attempt to keep independent or smaller parties off the ballot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>. He argues that independent voices can directly represent the issues important to their constituents without being constrained by party platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>.

### Bottom-Up Approach to Governance and Society
Cuban argues against "top-down" approaches from both Republican (trickle-down economics) and Democratic (trickle-down big government programs) parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>. He supports a "bottom-up" approach, where government's role is primarily to provide basic needs like education, safety, healthcare, food, and shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. Beyond that, government should avoid encouraging conformity and instead "remove as much friction as we can" to allow people to "blossom and try things that they need to try" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:44">[01:01:44]</a>. This approach encourages entrepreneurship and innovation at all levels, recognizing that even small ideas can lead to significant developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.

Individuals should embrace being "different" by continually learning and consuming diverse information, leading to new perspectives and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. He believes the best time to pursue an idea is "when you're dead ass broke" because there's "nothing to lose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>.

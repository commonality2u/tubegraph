The expansion of [[housing_credit_expansion | housing credit]] was initially seen as beneficial, stemming from a belief that making credit easier for people to purchase homes would increase their wealth and portfolios through house appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This approach was also thought to alleviate concerns, such as those related to job security or human capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The objective of increasing property ownership was widely accepted across political spectrums, with both the right and left converging on the idea of expanding [[housing_credit_expansion | housing credit]] to enable workers to own homes and become wealthier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Dangers of Excessive Credit Expansion

While expanding [[housing_credit_expansion | housing credit]] can be a good idea within limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, it became problematic when it turned into an unchecked movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Excessive credit, pushed too easily, can lead to significant harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Individuals who receive this credit can be harmed, particularly if they acquire it at a time when prices are rapidly escalating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. They may ultimately be unable to afford the homes or the lifestyle that home equity lines of credit initially seemed to facilitate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Many who drew down on their home equity lines later found that property prices collapsed, leaving them with no equity and deep in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. These outcomes contribute to the [[economic_and_social_consequences_of_unaffordable_housing | economic and social consequences of unaffordable housing]].

## Illusion of Wealth and Debt

The political pressure to "do something" when incomes were stagnant led to policies that kept people content through expanded credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. When incomes fail to grow, increased consumption often relies on debt or equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This system created the illusion that people were not borrowing because their home prices were continually increasing, making them believe they were simply drawing down on existing equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The term "draw down" sounded more appealing than "borrowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

In reality, people were borrowing against an appreciation that became increasingly fragile and was ultimately based on a housing market bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

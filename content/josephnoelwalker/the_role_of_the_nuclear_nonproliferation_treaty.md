The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is a foundational international agreement designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

## Origins and Purpose

In the 1960s, there were many "dark predictions" that within a generation, there would be dozens of nuclear states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. However, as of 2023, there are only nine nuclear states, suggesting a "relative success" in [[nuclear_nonproliferation_success_factors | nuclear nonproliferation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The NPT, which was finally tabled in 1968 and took effect in 1970, was a direct outcome of the near-catastrophe of the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Correspondence between U.S. President Kennedy and Soviet Premier Khrushchev after the crisis quickly led to the decision that a treaty was needed to prevent further proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The treaty established a "norm" against nuclear weapons, asserting that they are "too devastating and dangerous" and "threaten the Earth itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:59">[02:00:59]</a>.

The NPT is often referred to as the "cornerstone of nuclear arms control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:28">[02:26:28]</a> and is considered a "fundamental document" that should be viewed with a similar level of commitment as the Charter of the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:32">[02:26:32]</a>.

### The Central Bargain

The NPT establishes a bifurcation between "nuclear-weapon states" (NWS) and "non-nuclear-weapon states" (NNWS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>. NWS are defined as states that built and tested a nuclear explosive device before January 1, 1967 (US, Soviet Union, UK, France, and China) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>.

The central bargain of the NPT was:
*   NNWS would not acquire nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>.
*   NWS would work towards universal nuclear disarmament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>.

NNWS were also promised support from the major powers for peaceful uses of nuclear energy if they did not go nuclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>. This bargain was intended to be "continuous and simultaneous," leading to a world free of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>.

## The 1995 Review and Extension Conference

The NPT was initially given a lifespan of 25 years, after which it would be reviewed and either renewed permanently or set aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:40">[01:13:40]</a>. The 1995 Review and Extension Conference in New York was seen as the "only opportunity" to permanently extend the NPT, as subsequent votes would require new ratification by a majority of member states, which would be "impossible" to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

### Context of the Conference

A major challenge at the conference was the widespread feeling among NNWS that the NWS had "not really upheld their end of the bargain" regarding disarmament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>. This unfulfilled promise remains a significant issue in the "Enterprise of attempting to eliminate or get rid of nuclear weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>.

For instance, Egypt was "absolutely resolute" that there would be no extension of the treaty unless real progress was shown on the disarmament bargain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>. The United States, in particular, placed "absolute" importance on extending the treaty and engaged in diplomatic efforts to persuade states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.

### Australia's Diplomatic Role

Richard Butler, Australia's ambassador to the UN at the time, played a "crucial role" in the NPT's renewal and extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>. The solution to the disarmament deadlock was a proposal for a separate "supplementary set of documents" that prescribed "better behavior" on the part of NWS regarding disarmament and elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>. These documents, while not legally binding, were politically binding commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>.

Key commitments included a fissile materials cut-off treaty, a reaffirmation of the NPT's Article VI commitments, and crucially, a commitment to a [[the_comprehensive_nucleartestban_treaty_negotiations | Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] (CTBT) by 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a>.

This political deal was brokered during a dinner at Ambassador Butler's residence in New York, where representatives from main opinion groups, including non-aligned countries and permanent members of the Security Council, gathered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. The meeting, which started after 9 p.m. and finished around 2 a.m., resulted in an agreement that was adopted the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:31">[01:22:31]</a>. This allowed the NPT to be "really indefinitely" extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:41">[01:21:41]</a>.

## Australia's Historical Stance

Despite its later efforts in nuclear disarmament, Australia initially refused to sign the NPT for two years under the Gorton government (1968-1970) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Australia was the second-to-last country to sign the treaty before it came into force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

The primary reason for this delay was to keep open the option of developing its own nuclear arsenal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Sir Philip Baxter, Chairman of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, who had worked on the Manhattan Project, influenced Prime Minister John Gorton to pursue the development of a reactor at Jervis Bay to produce weapons-grade fissile material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Baxter believed "white folk" had a right to develop weapons to keep "the hordes away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

This led to a "very severe argument" within the Australian bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Dean Rusk, the then-U.S. Secretary of State, expressed deep concern about Gorton's reluctance, noting that Gorton sounded "almost like [Charles] de Gaulle" in expressing a lack of reliance on the United States for nuclear weapons in the event of [[nuclear_blackmail_and_its_impact_on_international_relations | nuclear blackmail]] or attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The decision to join the NPT ultimately came down to joining "where the whole world was going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, though Australia entered with "reservations" that allowed for withdrawal in "extremist" national interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

The possibility of Australia building nuclear weapons was "by no means small" and was a "line ball" decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## Effectiveness and Critiques

The NPT is considered "absolutely fundamental" and the "cornerstone of nuclear arms control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:24">[02:26:24]</a>. One of its key successes is that "no one has proliferated except for a handful of those who are themselves not members of the treaty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:53">[02:27:53]</a>. Every country that signed and ratified the treaty has conformed to its terms, not acquiring weapons or assisting others in doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:07">[02:28:07]</a>. The number of nuclear states has been contained to the initial five plus four others (North Korea, India, Israel, Pakistan) who are not signatories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:23">[02:28:23]</a>.

The treaty helped to stop or reverse nuclear weapons programs in countries like Sweden, South Africa, Argentina, and Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:31">[02:30:31]</a>. South Africa, which did develop nuclear weapons, later dismantled its program and joined the NPT as part of the dismissal of the apartheid regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>.

However, the NPT is a "flawed instrument" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:38">[02:27:38]</a>, as the "basic bargain" of disarmament by NWS has not been fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:40">[02:27:40]</a>. While the total number of nuclear weapons has significantly reduced from 60,000 to around 10,000-11,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:46">[02:55:46]</a>, there has been "no serious progress" towards the elimination of existing stockpiles by the designated NWS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:39">[01:15:39]</a>.

The core argument for elimination, articulated by the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, is based on three propositions:
1.  As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will "one day be used by accident or design" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
2.  Any use would be "absolutely devastating to the whole world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
3.  The "only safe thing to do with nuclear weapons is to see them onto a museum shelf" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:28">[02:10:28]</a>.

This sentiment underscores the continued relevance of the NPT's disarmament goals.

## Conclusion

The NPT remains a critical framework for [[nuclear_nonproliferation_success_factors | nuclear nonproliferation]], despite its unfulfilled promises regarding disarmament. The ongoing debate about nuclear weapons, including notions of "minimal deterrence" or "tactical use," is seen as "nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>, as any use of nuclear weapons would be catastrophic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a>. The treaty's strength lies in its widely accepted norm against proliferation, which has largely held the line against the dire predictions of widespread nuclearization from the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

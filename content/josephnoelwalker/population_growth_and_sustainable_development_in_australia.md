Australia's economic landscape has seen a significant slowdown in productivity growth over the past two decades, leading to stagnant or falling growth in real GDP per person, a key measure of living standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This context highlights the urgent need for new economic reforms, which have been largely absent since the introduction of a consumption tax in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Historical Perspective on Australian Population

In November 2007, then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd asked Ken Henry about the sustainable population of Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. At that time, Australia's population was around 22-23 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>. Henry's initial estimate for a sustainable population was 15 million, which surprised Rudd who thought it could be 50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>. Despite the current population exceeding 15 million, the concept of a larger population, such as 50 million, could be sustainable if supported by very serious policy considerations, particularly concerning where people would live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>.

## Challenges of Current Population Growth Strategy

Australia, almost uniquely among OECD countries, has pursued a high population growth strategy, primarily through net migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a>. This strategy has been adopted as a way to address stagnant productivity growth and rising dependency ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>. However, this approach has led to significant second-order consequences due to its implementation within the existing footprint of Australia's five major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">[01:08:57]</a>.

### [[housing_affordability_crisis_in_australia | Housing Affordability]]
The current strategy has exacerbated the [[housing_affordability_crisis_in_australia | housing affordability crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. Ken Henry notes that while housing affordability was an issue in his youth, it was "nothing like the [[housing_affordability_crisis_in_australia | housing affordability crisis]] my children have faced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>. He highlights that many young people, even with good jobs, struggle to buy homes without parental financial assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>. This raises concerns about [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | intergenerational equity]], especially for those without wealthy parents or grandparents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:55">[00:59:55]</a>.

### Environmental and Congestion Externalities
The issue of sustainability in population growth is primarily about environmental degradation and congestion externalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:29">[01:59:29]</a>. Ken Henry believes these issues have not been handled well because a spatial lens has not been applied to population policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:44">[01:59:44]</a>. Current discussions often focus on the overall population number rather than a more "richly textured" conversation about where people could live, what skills they should have, and how to enable higher rates of population growth through different spatial distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:02">[02:00:02]</a>.

## Policy Ideas for Distribution and Development

To accommodate population growth sustainably, Ken Henry suggests "pretty creative policy design" is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.

### New City Development
A radical idea proposed is to build new cities rather than solely expanding existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>. For instance, instead of Sydney and Melbourne growing to 8 million people each, Australia could build a new city of 10 million people in a currently uninhabited area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>. This idea was inspired by observations in China, where similar questions about accommodating large populations are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. Alternatively, Treasury considered 10 cities of 1 million people along the Sydney to Melbourne corridor, potentially linked by high-speed rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>. The historical lack of high-speed rail viability in Australia is often attributed to low population density, but it's suggested that high-speed rail could *create* density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>.

Economists are typically uncomfortable with "planning from on high" and deciding where people should live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a>. However, Henry believes the current trajectory of population growth, with cities like Sydney and Melbourne increasing by 150,000 people annually, is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:39">[01:07:39]</a>. He notes that the optimal city size, according to some economic literature, is around 150,000-200,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>.

### Infrastructure Investment
Building new cities requires identifying reasons for people to live there, often linked to employment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. The example of Port Macquarie is cited as a successful case of regional growth driven by services rather than traditional manufacturing or primary industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:46">[01:10:46]</a>. The construction of a new hospital in Port Macquarie was identified as the catalyst for its rapid growth, attracting health professionals and driving residential construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:18">[01:12:18]</a>. This suggests that creating foundational attractors, like healthcare or education facilities, can drive population redistribution and economic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:17">[01:14:17]</a>.

## Demographic Trends and Fertility

The concept of a "sustainable population" is often related to minimizing the total dependency ratio (young and old dependents divided by the workforce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:01">[01:16:01]</a>. This minimum occurs when the fertility rate is equal to the replacement rate (around 2.1 births per woman) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>.

### The Baby Bonus Experiment
Australia's fertility rate plummeted in the late 1960s and early 1970s, to around 1.7 or 1.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:34">[01:16:34]</a>, after a post-war period of very high rates (four or four and a half) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>. The "baby bonus" policy, though not Henry's idea, appeared to have a surprising effect on boosting the birth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. However, while a few thousand dollars upfront might encourage births, it's not enough to make a significant change to reach replacement rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:28">[01:20:28]</a>. Other factors like childcare and supporting dual-income families are also critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:47">[01:19:47]</a>.

> [!info] Intergenerational Equity
> The current tax system, particularly the reliance on fiscal drag from personal income tax, is seen as undermining social cohesion and [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | intergenerational harmony]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. Favoring capital income over labor income through lower taxation on capital income and especially capital gains means that younger generations, facing high housing costs and student debt, feel they have been "robbed a bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>. While policies like indexing personal income tax scales would address this, such measures are often avoided by governments who rely on fiscal drag to improve budget projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>.

## Economic Implications

### Productivity and Capital Deepening
Australia's productivity performance, when benchmarked against the US (representing the technological frontier), generally sits around 80% of the US level, peaking around 85% in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:48">[01:21:48]</a>. Studies from the late 1990s suggested that the best Australia could realistically hope for was 95% of the US level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>. The remaining 5% gap is attributed to factors like geographical isolation and fragmentation of the national market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>.

Productivity growth has two main drivers:
1.  **Capital Deepening**: Augmenting labor with capital assistance, including AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:21">[01:24:21]</a>. This requires a national investment rate matched to the workforce growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>. Australia has experienced "capital shallowing" in the last decade due to a collapse in the investment rate, a level previously only seen during recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>.
2.  **Multifactor Productivity Growth**: Often described as the "stuff we don't understand," it's a residual measure reflecting new ways of doing things or smarter processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:47">[01:25:47]</a>.

### Investment Rate Challenges
The key question for Australia's economy is why the investment rate has been stuck at recessionary levels for a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>. The global investment community needs a compelling reason to deploy capital in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:51">[01:27:51]</a>. The prevailing "mining boom" narrative, while seemingly positive, is viewed as damaging, contributing to complacency and presenting an unattractive picture to the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>.

> [!example] Missed Opportunities in Investment
> 1.  **Critical Minerals Processing**: Australia has significant deposits of critical minerals but undertakes almost no processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:32">[01:29:32]</a>. Despite technical challenges and "dirty" processing, Australia has expertise in chemical engineering that could be utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:16">[01:30:16]</a>.
> 2.  **Engineered Wood Products**: Most timber from native forests is exported as raw chips or pulp, or used as firewood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>. Despite increasing use of timber in construction, Australia imports almost all of its engineered wood products, which seems economically illogical given transport costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:15">[01:32:15]</a>. This suggests a "mindset thing" where Australia focuses on extracting and exporting raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:38">[01:32:38]</a>.

## Policy-Making and Reform

The period of ambitious economic reforms in Australia ran from 1983 to 2000, followed by 25 years of "comparatively lackluster reform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:34">[01:38:34]</a>.

> [!info] Why the Reform Era Ended
> Ken Henry attributes the end of the reform era primarily to:
> 1.  **Complacency**: Linked to the national narrative, particularly the "mining myth," which suggests that mineral resources underpin prosperity and reduces the perceived need for further reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>. The significant increase in Australia's terms of trade since late 2002 has contributed to this complacency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:15">[01:44:15]</a>.
> 2.  **Lack of Political Ambition**: Unlike past leaders such as Paul Keating and John Howard, who were motivated by a desire to demonstrate national leadership and leave a legacy of "hard stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:03">[01:45:03]</a>, some recent politicians have explicitly stated they don't seek a legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:32">[01:49:32]</a>.
> 3.  **The "Small Target Strategy"**: Political actors adopt a "small target strategy" to avoid controversy and only implement policies explicitly mandated before an election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>. This combination results in inaction once in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:40">[02:02:40]</a>.
> 4.  **Absence of a "Burning Platform"**: Major reforms, like those in the 1980s, were often catalyzed by a "burning platform" narrative, such as Keating's "Banana Republic" statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:16">[02:01:16]</a>. This creates a sense of urgency, which is currently lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:04">[02:01:04]</a>.

### Need for Fiscal Discipline
The **state capability and policy efficacy in Australia** are hampered by a failure to maintain fiscal discipline. The Charter of Budget Honesty Act, designed to ensure fiscal transparency and principles, has been "trashed by both sides of politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. This raises concerns about Australia's credit rating and future economic stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>.

### Tax Reform
Henry proposes addressing the [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | intergenerational equity]] issue by indexing personal income tax scales, a reversal of his long-held public stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>. This would prevent the situation where workers experience a reduction in real wages but pay higher average tax rates due to fiscal drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.

He also emphasizes the need for a comprehensive review of Commonwealth-State roles and responsibilities, starting with expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:54">[02:04:54]</a>. The current system of overlapping responsibilities, as highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, is "deplorable" and prevents better outcomes for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:20">[02:05:20]</a>. This review should lead to a mature conversation about tax base allocation between levels of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:20">[02:06:20]</a>, aiming to abolish economically egregious or fragile state taxes like stamp duties on property transfers and taxes on insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:27">[02:07:27]</a>.

### Resource Curse and [[australia_and_nuclear_power | Nuclear Power]]
The debate around a mining tax highlights the "resource curse" argument, where a booming mining sector can "crowd out" other parts of the economy by increasing domestic costs and appreciating the real exchange rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. Australia experienced a 70% real exchange rate appreciation from late 2002 to 2012, equivalent to removing a 70% tariff on import-competing industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

The political potency of the "killing the goose that lays the golden egg" narrative, despite its economic inaccuracies, prevented the implementation of a mining tax even with public support for its underlying concept (e.g., [[australia_and_nuclear_power | Alaska Permanent Fund]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

> [!info] Conclusion
> Australia's challenge lies in overcoming complacency, fostering political ambition, and strategically planning for population growth beyond the confines of existing urban centers. Addressing these fundamental issues through bold policy reforms and public engagement is crucial for long-term sustainable development and prosperity.

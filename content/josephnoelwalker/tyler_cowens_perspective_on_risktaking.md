## Questioning Success for Optimal Risk

Early in the process of selecting "India winners" for grants, [[Tyler Cowen]] questioned the speaker's approach, even though all chosen projects were succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. He specifically asked, "are you taking enough risk where's the failure rate?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This inquiry was considered characteristic of Cowen, as most people would leave successful operations unchallenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Analysis of Rejection Criteria

Prompted by Cowen's question, the speaker reviewed all applicants who were not granted funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The rejections were not found to be due to projects being excessively risky or "out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Instead, the primary reasons for rejection included the person not having a well-developed idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Interestingly, many projects were rejected precisely because they were *not* risky enough, being described as "cookie cutter" or "boring," with the question "do we really need one more of this in the world?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Following this assessment, the speaker felt comfortable with the level of risk being undertaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Recommended Practice for Talent Scouts

The speaker recommends that new [[risk_assessment_in_talent_scouting | talent scouts]] regularly perform this exercise every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This involves reviewing past rejections to evaluate if the decisions were correct and to reflect on the rationale behind them, considering insights gained from subsequent grant processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

While a significant portion of Australians show support for acquiring nuclear weapons, certain preconditions would need to be met before such a move could be justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

## Public Opinion Context

A 2022 [[low_institute_poll_on_nuclear_weapons_support_in_australia | Low Institute poll]] indicated that approximately 36% of Australians either support or strongly support Australia acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This finding was surprising to some observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This surprise was less pronounced following the announcement of [[impact_of_aukus_on_australias_stance_towards_nuclear_power | AUKUS]] in September 2021, as there was a notable lack of widespread [[reactions_to_australias_potential_nuclear_developments | popular reaction]] or [[historical_perspective_on_antinuclear_sentiment in australia | anti-nuclear campaigns]] against Australia birthing nuclear reactors, which contrasts with the strong [[historical_perspective_on_antinuclear_sentiment_in_australia | anti-nuclear sentiment]] of the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. The poll results might suggest that Australians are more relaxed about nuclear power than previously thought, though it's also posited that the public might not have fully considered the implications and costs of such a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## Key Preconditions for Acquisition

### 1. Regional Proliferation

A primary precondition for Australia to consider acquiring nuclear weapons would be if regional powers, specifically Japan and South Korea, first underwent [[nuclear_proliferation_and_its_implications | nuclear proliferation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Given Australia's geographic distance from potential threats compared to countries like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, it faces a less acute security dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. It is considered "impossible" for Australia to go nuclear before these countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

*   **Taiwan:** Taiwan is unlikely to pursue a nuclear weapons program due to its open society and deep penetration by Chinese intelligence services, making it impossible to keep such a program secret. Discovery would likely trigger an invasion from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **Japan and South Korea:** These nations are in a different position. If the American extended nuclear deterrent were perceived as imminent to withdraw or if they lost faith in its credibility, they might consider developing their own nuclear capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

### 2. Indonesian Acquiescence or Cooperation

Another critical threshold is securing Indonesia's acceptance or, ideally, cooperation regarding Australia's nuclear acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. Without Indonesian acquiescence, any problem Australia seeks to solve by going nuclear would be undermined by the new problems created with Indonesia, potentially turning Indonesia into an adversary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Achieving Indonesian cooperation, however, is seen as unlikely due to the significant step it would represent for both nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

## Credibility of Extended Nuclear Deterrence

The credibility of America's extended nuclear deterrence, which provides a nuclear umbrella for allies like Australia, is a key factor in this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

*   **The Dilemma:** The US has an agreement to use its nuclear weapons in defense of allies threatened with nuclear weapons, preventing them from needing their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. However, the emergence of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capabilities, such as those possessed by North Korea, complicates this bargain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. The question arises whether the US would risk its own cities (e.g., Seattle or Los Angeles) being destroyed to defend an ally like South Korea, a scenario deemed "not credible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. Asking the US to trade its cities for an ally's capital is considered "ridiculous" and "impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
*   **South Korea's Approach:** South Korea appears to have drawn the conclusion that relying on the US in such extreme circumstances is not credible and is developing more independent capabilities to counter the North Korean threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.
*   **Australia and Japan's Approach:** In contrast, Australia and Japan have chosen to further entrench their alliances with the United States, as partly evidenced by [[impact_of_aukus_on_australias_stance_towards_nuclear_power | AUKUS]] and Japan doubling its defense spending while strengthening US ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. The South Korean approach is considered more credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.

### The Challenge of Political Will

Even if the credibility of extended deterrence wanes, a shift for Australia to acquire nuclear weapons would necessitate a "huge cultural shift" within Australia's two major political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. The US-Australia alliance is deeply embedded within bureaucracies, intelligence sharing (Five Eyes), and defense departments, including Australian personnel embedded within US commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. The alliance is central to the political culture of both Labor and Liberal parties, making fundamental reassessments difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.

### The Nuclear Taboo

While extended nuclear deterrence may not offer significant benefits for Australia's security in a crisis where it is plausibly threatened with nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>, it is argued that Australia could call the bluff on nuclear threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. This is based on the extremely high "culture against nuclear use" and the difficulty of breaking that taboo, especially against a country like Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>.

The concept of nuclear blackmail, where a country threatens nuclear use to achieve conventional objectives, is a complex issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>. Historically, the US used nuclear threats to deter China from invading Taiwan in the 1950s, which worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>. However, nuclear blackmail only works if the target believes the threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>. If Australia believes China would never actually use nuclear weapons, then China's threats would not be credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>. While there is a risk that even a small probability of nuclear use could affect decision-making, the costs of Australia becoming a nuclear weapons power are also immense, necessitating a careful weighing of these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:00">[15:56:00]</a>.

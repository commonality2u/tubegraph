A 2022 poll by the Lowy Institute revealed that approximately 36% of Australians either support or strongly support Australia acquiring nuclear weapons, a finding that surprised some analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## [[australia_and_nuclear_power | Australia and Nuclear Power]] and Public Opinion

The surprising result of the [[nuclear_weapons_poll_in_australia | nuclear weapons poll in Australia]] is interpreted as being less surprising in the context of the AUKUS announcement in August 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. One significant "dog that didn't bark politically" following AUKUS was the issue of [[australia_and_nuclear_power | nuclear power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Historically, the 1980s saw strong anti-nuclear campaigns in Australia, involving figures like Peter Garrett and the Greens Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. However, when the Morrison government announced AUKUS in September 2021, the expected popular opposition to the idea of Australia having nuclear reactors, potentially in Sydney Harbour or HMAS Sterling, did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This led to the conclusion that Australians might be more relaxed about [[australia_and_nuclear_power | nuclear power]] than previously assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This shift likely influenced the opposition's decision to announce civilian nuclear power as an election promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

When asked about acquiring nuclear weapons, poll questions are generally presented without counterfactuals, meaning respondents are not asked about potential costs or trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This suggests that the public may not have fully considered the implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Preconditions for Australia Acquiring Nuclear Weapons

Australia acquiring nuclear weapons would likely only be justified if there was prior [[nuclear_proliferation_and_deterrence_in_asia | nuclear proliferation]] in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
Given the security dilemmas faced by Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan with China, it is considered highly improbable that Australia would go nuclear before these countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Australia is geographically further away from China, making it harder for military power to be projected against it compared to nearby targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

*   **Japan and South Korea**: The first condition for Australia considering nuclear weapons is that Japan and likely South Korea would need to go nuclear first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This might occur if American withdrawal from the region was imminent, or if these nations lost faith in the alliance and the [[credibility_of_american_extended_nuclear_deterrence | extended nuclear deterrent]] they currently enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Taiwan**: Taiwan would likely not go nuclear because it's nearly impossible for any country, particularly an open society deeply penetrated by Chinese intelligence services, to keep a nuclear weapons program secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Discovery would immediately trigger an invasion from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Indonesia's Acquiescence**: Another critical precondition is that Indonesia would need to be amenable to Australia acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Without Indonesian acquiescence or, preferably, cooperation, any problem Australia sought to solve by going nuclear would be undermined by new, worse problems created with Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Indonesia could become an adversary, negating the original strategic goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Cooperative development with Indonesia, though unlikely, would be the ideal scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## The [[credibility_of_american_extended_nuclear_deterrence | Credibility of American Extended Nuclear Deterrence]]

[[credibility_of_american_extended_nuclear_deterrence | Extended nuclear deterrence]] is the basic agreement where the United States promises its non-nuclear allies that if they are threatened with nuclear weapons, the US will use its own nuclear weapons in their defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This arrangement is meant to prevent allies from developing their own nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### The South Korean Case
The case of South Korea illustrates the challenge to this deterrence. With North Korea developing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of delivering nuclear warheads to American cities, the bargain changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. It implies that the US would sacrifice one or more of its own cities (e.g., Seattle or Los Angeles) for Seoul, which is deemed "not credible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

This assessment is based on a cold-blooded evaluation of American vital interests, not moral character or courage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. It's argued that asking the US to risk its cities on behalf of allies is an impossible and unreasonable request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Consequently, South Korea has concluded that it must develop more independent capabilities to counter the North Korean threat, rather than solely relying on the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

In contrast, Australia and Japan have so far taken the opposite approach, seeking to further entrench their ties with the United States, as partly demonstrated by AUKUS and Japan doubling its defense spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The South Korean approach is considered more credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

## Australia's Deep Alliance with the United States

Reliance on [[credibility_of_american_extended_nuclear_deterrence | extended nuclear deterrence]] would require a massive cultural shift in Australia, which its two major political parties might not be capable of facilitating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The US-Australia alliance is deeply embedded within bureaucracies, exemplified by the Five Eyes intelligence arrangement and Australian personnel embedded in US commands like Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:10:00]</a>.

The alliance is also sustained by the political culture of both major Australian parties, with both Labor and Liberal parties claiming historical ownership of the alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Historically, the Labor Party only achieved extended periods of government after fully reconciling itself with the US alliance and opposition to communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This deep embedding suggests a fundamental reassessment of the alliance relationship may be difficult for Australian political leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

While Australia may rely on the "vestiges" of extended nuclear deterrence for a long time, it is debated how much it truly benefits Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. It is argued that a security crisis where Australia could plausibly be threatened with nuclear weapons is difficult to imagine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

## The Nuclear Taboo and [[nuclear_blackmail_and_its_impact_on_international_relations | Nuclear Blackmail]]

The "nuclear taboo" suggests that the cultural barrier against the use of nuclear weapons is incredibly high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Therefore, if China were to threaten nuclear use against Australia, Australia might be able to call that bluff, believing China would not break this taboo against a relatively small country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

However, a more likely scenario for nuclear weapons use against Australia would be [[nuclear_blackmail_and_its_impact_on_international_relations | nuclear blackmail]], where a country like China threatens nuclear use to prevent Australia from engaging in conventional warfare or to coerce its acquiescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

This strategy has modern and historical precedents:
*   **Ukraine War**: Russia, under Vladimir Putin, frequently uses nuclear blackmail to deter direct intervention by the US and NATO allies in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
*   **Taiwan (1950s)**: The US successfully used nuclear threats to deter China from invading Taiwan in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

The effectiveness of [[nuclear_blackmail_and_its_impact_on_international_relations | nuclear blackmail]] hinges on the belief that the threat is credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. If Australia believes China would never actually use nuclear weapons, then China's threats would not be credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. The counterargument is that even a small probability of nuclear use carries such massive consequences that it would still influence decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:16:01]</a>. Ultimately, the debate involves weighing the risks of running that gamble against the huge costs for Australia of becoming a nuclear weapons power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:18]</a>.

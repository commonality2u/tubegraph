The "Shadow Mean" is a statistical concept that distinguishes between the observed mean (sample mean) from historical data and the true mean (population mean) of the process generating that data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The intuition behind it is that historical data, such as market drawdowns, deaths from war, or pandemic fatalities, might appear to follow a thin-tailed distribution when, in reality, they are generated by a fat-tailed process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This happens because extreme events, characteristic of fat-tailed distributions, can take a very long time to manifest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Understanding the Bias in Observed Means

When dealing with a one-tailed, fat-tailed distribution, most observations will be below the true mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Consequently, the mean computed from empirical observation will be biased downwards, underestimating the true mean of the underlying process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This is in contrast to thin-tailed distributions (like a Gaussian or normal distribution for height), where a small sample size doesn't significantly impact the estimation of the mean, as extreme events have little impact on the average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Examples of Shadow Mean Effects

*   **Financial Markets**: When stress-testing the S&P 500 using the past 10 years of data, the worst deviations are not represented due to insufficient sample size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Industries like biotech are heavy-tailed, meaning what is observed likely underestimates the true mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Volatility Selling**: Selling volatility often results in an observed mean that is significantly higher than the actual shadow mean, indicating a potential for much larger losses than historically observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Operational Loss**: The concept of shadow mean has been applied in quantitative finance to analyze operational losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Application to Warfare

The concept of the Shadow Mean has been applied to warfare to understand the true underlying risk of large-scale conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The process generating war fatalities is visibly riskier than what has been observed in recent history, potentially by a factor of three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This implies that the historical process underestimates the true process of warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Inter-arrival Time of Wars
A significant finding in this research is that the waiting time for wars with deaths exceeding 10 million people (like World War II) is estimated to be "a bit over 100 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The inter-arrival time of these conflicts follows an exponential distribution, which means it is memoryless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

> "In other words, if it arrives on average every say 100 years and then we haven't had one in 100 years, okay, you don't say oh it's coming, it's memoryless so you wait, wait another 100 years, the expectations stay the same." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>

### Fat-tailed Nature of War
The fatness (or "alpha") of war distribution remains consistent across historical periods, while the scale might change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This fat-tailed nature is influenced by factors such as:
*   The development of increasingly destructive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The ability to kill has significantly increased and industrialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Globalization, allowing violence to spread systemically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   Incompetence in foreign policy and decision-making, leading to naive interventions and unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. An [[geopolitical_and_governance_implications_of_ai | interventionist foreign policy]], particularly from the United States, can be more dangerous than isolationism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Historical Exaggeration of Death Counts
Research by Professor Pasquale Cirillo and others found that historical death counts in wars were often exaggerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Both conquerors and victims had incentives to inflate numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Conquerors**: Exaggerated to appear more intimidating, hoping to deter opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Victims**: Exaggerated due to the valorization of victimhood, particularly prominent in Christianity and Shi'a Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Historically, there's evidence of fabricated martyrdom stories in ancient Roman southern Mediterranean regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

To account for this, researchers analyzed different historical accounts for each war, randomizing between high and low estimates to create numerous historical permutations. This process consistently yielded the same "alpha" (fatness) for the distribution, indicating robustness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The absence of a conflict on the scale of World War II (which was nearly 80 years ago) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a> does not provide sufficient statistical grounds to conclude that global violence has declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. To statistically infer a change in the distribution of war fatalities, one would need to observe about 300 years without such a conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

The concept of the Shadow Mean highlights the [[precautionary_principle_and_systemic_risks | precautionary principle]] in understanding [[potential_existential_risks_and_benefits_of_agi | systemic risks]]: observed historical data may significantly underestimate the true underlying risks of rare, extreme events. It suggests a need for a nuanced view of probability and statistics, particularly when dealing with phenomena that are open-ended and heavy-tailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

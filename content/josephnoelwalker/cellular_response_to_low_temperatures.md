In a biological cell, molecules behave like a "bag of molecules that's being shaken all the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Nothing is guaranteed to be in a particular place unless it is very strongly bonded there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This fundamental nature of cellular operation, relying on molecules bouncing about in random directions through passive diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, provides insight into why processes like [[cryopreservation_and_its_applications | cryopreservation]] are possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## The Phenomenon of [[Cryopreservation_and_its_applications | Cryopreservation]]

It is considered incredibly strange that anything can be [[cryopreservation_and_its_applications | cryopreserved]] and subsequently rewarmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. For instance, resected brain tissue can be cooled to -130Â°C and below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Imagine a complex factory where all workers are stopped, spun around, and then begin walking in completely random directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This analogy illustrates what [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreservation]] does: it randomizes the molecular motion of all molecules at very low temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Cellular Invariance to Randomization

Most systems built at the human scale are incompatible with such a state of molecular randomization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. We typically do not design systems that are [[invariance_of_cells_to_environmental_changes | invariant]] to this kind of profound disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. However, cells possess this unique property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

This [[invariance_of_cells_to_environmental_changes | invariance]] is deeply linked to how cells evolved. Cells have adapted to operate with very high amounts of [[thermal_noise_and_cellular_evolution | thermal noise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This evolutionary adaptation has endowed them with properties that make them remarkably [[invariance_of_cells_to_environmental_changes | invariant]] to the randomization induced by [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreservation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## A Shifting Global Landscape

History is in motion, presenting the United States with an unprecedented challenge from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. For over a century, the US has not faced an adversary or coalition whose GDP exceeded 60% of its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This threshold was not crossed even by the combined might of Japan and Germany during World War II, nor by the Soviet Union at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, China surpassed this 60% GDP threshold in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. On a purchasing power parity basis, China's GDP entirely surpassed the US GDP in 2017 and is now more than 20% larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Inevitably, this significant economic power is being converted into military might <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## US Strategic Future in Asia

The central question remains whether the United States will have the resolve to fight China for dominance in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. One perspective suggests that the US may not, simply due to a perceived lack of vital interests in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This scenario has significant implications for allies like Australia, which has historically relied on the protection of a great power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Three primary options for America's strategic future in Asia are:
1.  America fights China for dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
2.  America enters a power-sharing relationship with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
3.  America leaves the region entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

### Possibility of Fighting for Dominance

The most compelling reason for the US to fight for dominance is rooted in its self-image and status as the leading power in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This perspective, articulated by figures like Peter Varghese (former head of the Office of National Intelligence), suggests that America's sense of self is so deeply embedded that it cannot surrender to a competitor's rise in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

However, several factors indicate a lack of resolve for such a contest:
*   **Defense Spending:** American defense spending as a percentage of GDP has been trending downwards since about 2011, currently at 3.4% to 3.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. During the [[comparison_of_china_challenge_to_cold_war | Cold War]], it reached around 8%, and during the Vietnam War, it was 6% to 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. While the US is wealthier now, a significant increase would be expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   [[role_of_american_presidents_in_addressing_china | **Presidential Leadership**]]: No American president since China's rise as a great power (early post-Cold War years) has declared the China challenge a national mission requiring a whole-of-nation effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This [[comparison_of_china_challenge_to_cold_war | challenge is bigger than the Cold War]] economically, and requires more than a "beltway project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   [[us_intellectual_and_cultural_readiness_for_china_challenge | **Intellectual and Cultural Readiness**]]: The [[beltway_community_vs_popular_culture_on_china_threat | intellectual environment and popular culture in the US]] do not suggest the nation is primed for such a contest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. Unlike the Cold War or the War on Terror, there is no widespread public or intellectual obsession with the China challenge outside the foreign policy establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

### Power Sharing vs. Full Withdrawal

While some (e.g., Hugh White) argue America will leave Asia entirely, another view suggests a long "interregnum" where the US enters a power-sharing arrangement with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. This middle period, a balance of power, is predicted to last a long time before full withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

*   **US Posture in Asia:** While China has massively expanded its military, US forward deployments in Japan and South Korea have remained relatively stable since the end of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. This means the US is declining relative to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   **Bureaucratic Inertia:** High bureaucratic barriers and low incentives for withdrawal keep US forces in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. However, Trump's potential for accelerating change and lowered competency levels in his administration could impact this inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
*   **China's Role:** China's incentive to "push out" the US is not strong enough to risk confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. The cost of forcing the US to leave (potential for disastrous war) is high, while the cost of watching America slowly shrink in place (from primacy to power sharing) is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

A US presence, even in a reduced, power-sharing capacity, preoccupies China more than full absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. It requires China to devote more resources to the US relationship, and could lead to nuclear proliferation in the region, further complicating China's strategic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

### Implications of Nuclear Deterrence

The credibility of America's [[challenges_related_to_extended_nuclear_deterrence_and_us_alliances | extended nuclear deterrence]] (the nuclear umbrella protecting allies) is increasingly questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:24">[01:02:24]</a>. The development of North Korean ICBMs, capable of striking American cities, fundamentally alters the bargain with allies like South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. The implicit question becomes whether the US would sacrifice a city like Seattle or Los Angeles for Seoul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>. This is considered an impossible and unreasonable request for allies to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>.

*   **South Korea's Approach:** South Korea is developing more independent capabilities to counter the North Korean threat, concluding that relying on the US is not credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>.
*   **Australia and Japan's Approach:** Australia and Japan, conversely, have sought to tie the Americans down even further, as seen with AUKUS and Japan doubling its defense spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Blackmail:** The concern is that [[implications_of_nuclear_blackmail_and_deterrence by countries like China | nuclear blackmail]], where a country like China threatens nuclear use to gain concessions without detonation, could work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>. Historical examples include the US deterring China from invading Taiwan in the 1950s by threatening nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>, and Putin's current nuclear threats to deter NATO intervention in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>. The effectiveness of nuclear blackmail relies on the credibility of the threat, and the immense consequences mean even a small probability can be influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>.

## Intelligence and Information in a New Era

Experience from intelligence agencies, such as the Office of National Assessments (now Office of National Intelligence), suggests that classified intelligence is of "negligible value" for understanding long-term international issues like [[uschina_relations_and_strategic_dominance_in_asia | China's rise]] or American decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The quality of open-source analysis is comparable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

Intelligence agencies excel in short-term assessments for specific events like international conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. However, the information environment has radically changed, moving from information scarcity to super-abundance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Espionage, historically a response to information deficits, faces an "existential problem" as the primary challenge shifts from unveiling secrets to grappling with an overwhelming volume of open-source information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

The intelligence world often focuses on "puzzles" (knowable facts like the number of nuclear weapons) rather than "mysteries" (unknowable intentions), which is an easier problem to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>. Bureaucratic vested interests also contribute to the continued emphasis on secret intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

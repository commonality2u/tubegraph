Australia possesses a notable "talent for bureaucracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This talent was particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the country's high-functioning administrative state performed well on most critical measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Australia's employment-to-population ratio returned to pre-crisis levels within 12 months, contrasting with the United States which had barely recovered five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. By the time international borders reopened in 2022, Australia had about one-fifth the number of deaths per capita as the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Despite a common perception among Australians that their government is not especially effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, a literature review on [[australias_state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | Australia's state capacity]] found it to be among the highest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. [[australias_state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | State capacity]] refers to the ability of governments at all levels to achieve their policy goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Pandemic Response: A Study in Contrasts

The Australian government's response to the pandemic showcased both significant successes and failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### JobKeeper: Economic Success
The JobKeeper program was lauded as one of the best economic responses globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. It successfully kept Australian employees connected to their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Its success was heavily enabled by "Single Touch Payroll," an IT system introduced in July 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>. This system automatically transmits payroll data to the ATO (Australian Tax Office) in real-time, providing instant information on worker pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. This infrastructure, initially for compliance, proved critical by significantly reducing the risk of fraud, enabling the ATO to ensure high integrity in JobKeeper delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.

### Vaccine Procurement: A Major Failure
In stark contrast, Australia's vaccine procurement strategy was described as "the worst in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
Initially, Australia largely focused on two vaccines: the UQ vaccine (which failed) and the AstraZeneca vaccine (which proved less efficacious than others) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This "all-in" approach lacked an insurance strategy, unlike Operation Warp Speed, which sponsored up to eight vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This resulted in Australia having the worst vaccination rate among OECD nations for several months in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Explaining the Discrepancy
*   **Health Department Factor**: There's a perception that "anything that happens in and around the health department is a kind of disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. While Treasury officials were "in the room" during vaccine discussions, they were likely "not at the table," unable to actively influence decisions or overrule the Health Department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Category Error in Advice**: Decision-makers, including former Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Health Minister Greg Hunt, may have treated the Department of Health's advice as medical advice, rather than [[public_administration_and_service_delivery | public health advice]] that should be subject to economic principles and broader considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **"Penny-Pinching" Mindset**: The Health Department, accustomed to fiscal constraint, struggled to adapt to a crisis where massive spending and risk-taking were justified by the enormous potential benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. This mindset, while appropriate for normal operations, was a "failure" in a pandemic context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **Tinbergen Rule Violation**: The procurement failure is also attributed to a failure to heed the Tinbergen Rule â€“ using one policy instrument per goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Australia tried to use vaccine procurement to double as industry policy, favoring vaccines that could be manufactured locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## Principles for Crisis Management

For future crises, several key principles are identified:

*   **Honesty and Transparency**: Be honest about what is known and unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. Hiding information, such as mask availability, erodes public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.
*   **Flexibility in Thinking**: Avoid fighting the "last war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. Crisis responses should not rigidly apply solutions from previous, different crises (e.g., direct cash payments from the 2008 financial crisis not being universally applicable to a supply-side pandemic crisis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.
*   **Maintain Optionality (Buy Insurance)**: Do not prematurely cut off options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. In the case of vaccines, buying a broad portfolio would have provided options for domestic use or foreign aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.
*   **Willingness to Spend**: In a major crisis, the welfare loss from inaction (e.g., mass unemployment) is immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. Governments should be willing to spend significantly, as the costs of intervention are often outweighed by the benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. Don't be "penny wise, pound foolish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>.
*   **Public Trust and Voluntary Behavior**: Much of government policy implementation, especially during crises, relies on people's "good faith" and "voluntary behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. Losing this willingness to cooperate can severely hamper the ability to implement effective policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. The vaccine rollout failure of 2021 particularly damaged this trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

## Insights from Working in Treasury

Working in Treasury provides dual insights into [[australias_state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | Australia's state capacity]]:
*   **Dedication of Public Servants**: Many public servants are "shockingly socially minded" and fundamentally want to do the right thing, often going "above and beyond" during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.
*   **Bureaucratic Inefficiency**: Conversely, there can be significant numbers of people in government departments who are "not doing anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>, raising questions about efficiency and resource allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.

## Centralization of Power

### Within the Commonwealth
There has been a centralization of power within the Commonwealth government towards central agencies like Treasury, Finance, and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>. These central agencies act as "gatekeepers" to ensure good policy is implemented, often weeding out "insane ideas" from line agencies or ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>. This centralization within the Commonwealth is generally seen as beneficial for [[australias_state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | state capacity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.

### Commonwealth vs. States
The division of power between the Commonwealth and the states is a more complex issue.
*   **Arguments for Decentralization**: Advocates for decentralization favor the "laboratories of democracy" concept, where states can experiment with different policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. This allows for sorting of people based on preferences for [[public_goods_in_the_us_versus_india | public goods]] and services, fostering competition among states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
*   **Arguments for Centralization**: Certain issues, like pandemics or economic downturns, have "spillover effects" across state borders, necessitating a national solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.
*   **Fiscal Federalism**: The current system of GST distribution, where the federal government collects revenue and then provides grants to states, creates a misalignment where the federal government has political accountability for services (like Medicare) but no direct role in implementing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>. A proposed reform is to broaden the GST, double its revenue, and eliminate specific grants, allowing states more autonomy over their spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. However, federal politicians are often reluctant to give up the power and credit associated with these grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>.

## Economic Plumbing: The Next Single Touch Payroll

"Economic plumbing" refers to the underlying digital infrastructure that enables efficient government operations.
*   **Single Touch Payroll** is lauded as a triumph of [[historical_perspective_on_technological_advancements_in_government | digitization and state capacity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.
*   **Next Ambitious Candidates**:
    *   **GST Turnover Reporting**: Moving from paper-based GST reporting to real-time electronic reporting for every transaction, as seen in Chile, could eliminate tax evasion and improve compliance efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.
    *   **Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)**: A CBDC could enable frictionless, instantaneous, and low-cost financial transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a>. This could position the issuing country at the forefront of the global financial system and facilitate the development of new financial instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>.

## Ideal Recession-Fighting Toolkit
For future recessions, an ideal toolkit would include:
*   **Shovel-Ready Infrastructure Projects**: These would be pre-planned, well-thought-out, and immediately implementable projects (e.g., environmental remediation, small-scale construction) that can inject money into the economy and employ people quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:26">[01:04:26]</a>. This contrasts with large-scale, long-lag infrastructure projects that may not have economic effects until years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>.
*   **Reformed Unemployment Insurance (UI)**: Australia's current flat-rate, indefinite UI payment is globally unique and inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>. An ideal system would be proportional to prior wages, time-limited, and automatically triggered by economic circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>. This would provide a living wage during a recession, helping to manage economic downturns more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>.

## Explaining Australia's High State Capacity

Several factors contribute to Australia's relatively high [[australias_state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | state capacity]]:
*   **High Public Expectations**: Australians generally expect their administrative state to function efficiently, like an "Apple product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>. Failures lead to political repercussions, creating a "good political incentives" equilibrium for quality [[public_administration_and_service_delivery | service delivery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:25">[01:15:25]</a>.
*   **Well-Paid Public Servants**: Frontline public service positions, such as those at Service NSW, are generally well-paid, which contributes to a more effective workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.
*   **Lower Frictions in Legislation**: Compared to countries like the US, the Australian system has fewer barriers to passing legislation and funding programs, allowing for quicker implementation of policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.
*   **Universal Services**: Services like Medicare, which almost all Australians use, ensure that even wealthy individuals have a stake in the system's quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. This widespread reliance creates broad political pressure for high standards.

## Lessons from the US

While Australia generally outperforms the US in [[australias_state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | state capacity]], there are areas where Australia could learn from the US, particularly in injecting more choice and competition into its systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>. Examples include the movement towards school choice and charter schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:20">[01:23:20]</a>, as well as considering benefits of competition in healthcare, without losing the safety net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:08">[01:25:08]</a>.

## Weaknesses and Challenges

Despite its strengths, Australia's [[australias_state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | state capacity]] faces challenges:
*   **"Grift Nation"**: Australia has built a "tremendous amount of grift" into its society and economy, with government subsidies and loopholes creating political constituencies that are difficult to dismantle (e.g., tax benefits for buying certain vehicles, NDIS services misuse) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:44">[01:46:44]</a>.
*   **Difficulty with Policy Reform**: There's a "status quo bias" and implicit "veto power" across different levels of government that hinder major policy reform, particularly in areas like fiscal federalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:07">[01:44:07]</a>.
*   **Erosion of Policy Quality**: The quality of policy debate and implementation in Australia has eroded, marked by a refusal to discuss tradeoffs and politicians promising "everything all the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:13">[01:39:13]</a>. This leads to issues like the public's perception of inflation being solely due to pandemic spending, without acknowledging the counterfactual of mass unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>.
*   **Challenges of "Hard" Crises**: While managing crises that involve spending money is "easy," crises that require "taking things away from people" (e.g., raising interest rates, not subsidizing bills) are much harder politically and often lead to worse outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:18">[01:43:18]</a>. This suggests a potential decline in the system's ability to navigate difficult policy choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:17">[01:45:17]</a>.

For future pandemics, ongoing preparedness is crucial, including investing in dedicated quarantine facilities (rather than relying on hotels) and fostering sovereign mRNA manufacturing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:25">[01:49:25]</a>. Lessons from JobKeeper also highlight the importance of being transparent about rules and enforcement to maintain public trust, even if some waste is an unavoidable consequence of rapid crisis response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:56">[01:54:56]</a>.

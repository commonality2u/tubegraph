This article explores the landscape of diplomatic strategies and multilateral diplomacy, drawing on the extensive career and insights of Australian diplomat Richard Butler. From his pivotal role in [[nuclear_nonproliferation_success_factors | nuclear nonproliferation]] efforts to his reflections on the art of negotiation and the future of global security, Butler's experiences offer a unique perspective on the complexities of international relations.

## The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)

The [[nuclear_nonproliferation_success_factors | Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) stands as a cornerstone of nuclear arms control, despite initial dark predictions in the 1960s that there would be dozens of nuclear states within a generation [00:00:11]. Today, there are only nine nuclear states, a testament to the relative success of [[nuclear_nonproliferation_success_factors | nonproliferation]] efforts [00:00:25].

### Origin and Core Bargain
The NPT emerged from a flurry of correspondence between John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev after the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the world "so close to blowing up" [00:00:43]. Signed by enough parties to take effect in 1970, the treaty was a promise to non-nuclear powers: if they refrained from developing nuclear weapons, they would receive support from major powers for peaceful uses of nuclear energy [00:01:06]. An unkept promise, however, was that nuclear powers would work towards universal nuclear disarmament [00:01:18]. This unfulfilled bargain led to restlessness among non-nuclear signatories, almost leading to the treaty's abrogation in 1995 when it came up for renewal [00:01:26].

### Australia's Initial Hesitation
Australia, despite its later storied efforts in nuclear disarmament, initially refused to sign the NPT for two years under John Gorton's government (1968-1970) [00:03:30]. This delay made Australia the second-last country to sign before the treaty came into force [00:03:42]. The primary reason for this hesitation was to keep open the option of developing its own nuclear arsenal [00:03:48].

At the time, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission was largely controlled by Sir Philip Baxter, a former Manhattan Project scientist [00:05:00]. Baxter advocated for Australia to develop its own nuclear weapons, viewing it as a right for "white folk" to "keep the hordes away from harming us" [00:06:03]. This perspective significantly influenced Gorton, leading to a "very severe argument" within the bureaucracy about acquiring nuclear weapons [00:06:27].

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>
> "Gorton is deeply concerned about giving up the nuclear option for a period as long as 25 years when he cannot know how the situation will develop in the area he sounded almost like deal in saying that Australia could not rely upon the United States for nuclear weapons under Anis in the event of nuclear blackmail or attack on Australia."
> — Dean Rusk, US Secretary of State, in a 1968 cable after meeting John Gorton

Butler noted that the possibility of Australia developing nuclear weapons was "by no means small" and "line ball" in the decision [00:10:46]. Ultimately, Australia joined the treaty but entered reservations, expressing a potential right to withdraw if its "supreme national interests" justified it [00:07:15].

### The 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference
The NPT, originally given a 25-year lifespan, faced a crucial moment at the 1995 review and extension conference in New York [00:11:14]. This was the "only opportunity to permanently extend the NPT" [00:11:41]. The core problem was that non-nuclear weapon states felt the nuclear weapon states had not upheld their bargain to disarm [00:14:01]. Countries like Egypt were "absolutely resolute" that there would be no extension without "real progress" on disarmament [00:16:13].

Richard Butler, then Australia's Ambassador to the UN, devised a solution: propose a separate, supplementary set of politically binding documents that would prescribe better behavior from nuclear weapon states [00:17:06]. These documents included commitments to a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty, a reaffirmation of Article VI commitments, and crucially, a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) by 1996 [00:17:23].

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>
> "Israel of course had you know was crucial and that's why I mentioned Egypt Egypt always had an eye on Israel's non-nuclear weapons capability that never been publicly conceded... but this weird event took place at at a luncheon in the UN where Perez said well of course referred to our nuclear weapons but the point is Israel was a problem because it had already proliferated and wasn't talking about it and had done years earlier."
> — Richard Butler

The solution was brokered at Butler's residence in New York, where representatives from key groups, including non-aligned countries, Middle Eastern states, and permanent Security Council members, met for dinner [00:21:51]. This "basic political deal" was struck the night before the conference closed and was adopted the next day [00:22:09].

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>
> "No one has proliferated except for a handful of those who are themselves not members of the treaty... Every country that has made that commitment reflected in their joining the treaty signing and ratifying their membership of it has actually conformed to it they've not acquired weapons themselves or given assistance to anyone else to do the same and it's held the line to these nine states."
> — Richard Butler

Butler argues the NPT is "absolutely fundamental" and the "cornerstone of nuclear arms control," establishing a norm against nuclear weapons [00:26:24]. He points out that all countries that have proliferated (e.g., North Korea, India, Israel, Pakistan) were not signatories to the NPT [00:28:59]. He also notes that several states, including Sweden, South Africa, Argentina, and Brazil, had active nuclear weapons programs but halted them and/or joined the NPT [00:30:31]. South Africa, in particular, disassembled its program and joined the NPT as part of ending apartheid [00:32:32].

## The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)

The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) is crucial for [[nuclear_nonproliferation_success_factors | nonproliferation]] because a proliferator, being a new entry to the possession of nuclear weapons, "need[s] to know when you enter a new weapons development is will it work so you have to test it to find out if we've got it right" [00:39:05].

### Negotiation Challenges
The CTBT negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva were held hostage by India due to the rule of consensus [00:39:39]. India "just threw rocks at it" and withheld consensus, preventing the treaty from being sent to the UN General Assembly [00:41:01].

### Richard Butler's Procedural Solution
To bypass India's block, Butler devised a "pretty simple" procedural trick [00:42:16]. Inspired by a classical joke about Homer, he decided to "table in the General Assembly the treaty on a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban in my in the name of Australia" [00:42:59]. He attached the text of the CTBT, identical to the one being considered in Geneva, to a draft resolution and submitted it to the General Assembly [00:43:27]. This tactic was "pretty novel" and had not been seen before or since [00:44:46].

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>
> "India was furious with me... very bad relations on the floor of the assembly with Indian persons which is very sad because my wife and I are very very attached to India."
> — Richard Butler

Butler then embarked on a "shuttle diplomacy" campaign, meeting with groups of permanent representatives from every member state of the United Nations over several weeks to build support for the resolution [00:45:20]. The General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted the text, opening it for signature [00:46:12]. A month later, US President Bill Clinton personally thanked Butler for getting the treaty on the table [00:46:36].

While the CTBT has not yet legally entered into force, it is "being acted upon as if it has" by many states [01:11:21]. Butler believes it is important to "get what you can" in such negotiations and "keep working to change that" [01:12:19].

### Verification
The CTBT spawned an impressive International Monitoring System, primarily a seismological system that registers tremors to detect underground explosions [01:36:20]. It also uses overhead systems to detect other signs, like flashes [01:37:17]. The collected data is analyzed at headquarters in Vienna, and notices are sent to participating states [01:37:34].

Verifying the non-existence of chemical and biological weapons is harder than nuclear weapons due to dual-use components [01:53:02]. However, the general procedure involves looking for "readily identifiable markers," "residues of work," and monitoring "throughput" of materials to detect diversions [01:50:49].

## Australia's Role in Multilateral Diplomacy
Butler notes that Australia has a "history within the UN context" of being "true believers from the beginning" [01:15:53]. Australians have consistently believed in the idea that international conduct can be "better and healthier if it's regulated by a center of laws and principles" [01:17:35]. This commitment has allowed Australia to play an "extraordinary history that is well above our weight as a middle power" [01:17:58].

Richard Butler was appointed Australia's first Ambassador for Disarmament in 1983 [00:49:08]. This unique appointment for a subject rather than a country allowed him to lead all Australian disarmament negotiations globally, contributing to his "shuttle diplomacy" expertise [00:50:00]. This role also helped him build significant credibility as "Mr. Disarmament" [00:52:20].

Australia's success in multilateral diplomacy can be attributed to several factors:
*   **Credibility:** Perceived as a "very good international citizen" [01:20:15].
*   **Middle Power Status:** Middle powers tend to do better in multilateral settings where they are not dominated by greater powers [01:20:22].
*   **Comfort with Power:** Australia is "uncomfortable with the exercise of power," even in its own region, preferring multilateral arenas [01:20:37].
*   **Talent and State Capability:** Australia has high [[state_capability_and_policy_efficacy_in_australia | state capacity]], with public service and diplomatic corps seen as high-status professions, attracting talented individuals [01:21:17].
*   **Perceived Neutrality:** Australia is often seen as relatively neutral by other countries [01:21:43].

However, Butler expresses concern that Australia is "in jeopardy today" of its multilateral diplomatic standing being "overtaken by our identity with the United States" [01:23:23]. He believes Australia has allowed itself to become "the instrument of American policy," harming its ability to have independent foreign policy [01:23:28].

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:42">[01:43:42]</a>
> "There is no question question it's been thoroughly researched and demonstrated that there's no question that the United States was complicit in Ker's decision to remove Whitlam from government."
> — Richard Butler on the 1975 dismissal of Gough Whitlam.

Butler recalls an encounter in 1976 with US Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who, on behalf of President Carter, assured Gough Whitlam that the US "will never again interfere in the election process in Australia" [01:45:28]. Butler interprets this as a confession of prior interference [01:45:48].

## The Art of Diplomacy

### Key Skills
For Butler, the most non-obvious and important skill for a diplomat is **listening** [01:26:07]. It's crucial to listen carefully to what others say, even when it's "clothed in more agreeable language" than it should be [01:27:13]. Diplomats must be able to "decipher what you hear," as individuals and states often "unwittingly" reveal their true intentions [01:27:48]. Another essential aspect is **patience** and **waiting**, as diplomatic processes often take time and immediate answers are rare [01:26:18].

### A Diplomat's Day
A typical day for a diplomat involves:
1.  **Reviewing Inputs:** Reading overnight messages, emails, news, and communications from home government and other embassies [01:29:13].
2.  **Actionable Intelligence:** Deciding what actions to take based on the inputs, such as sending messages, seeking further instructions, or calling colleagues [01:29:47].
3.  **Meetings and Consultations:** Engaging in formal and informal meetings at the UN headquarters, foreign ministries, or with other groups like the CANZ (Canada, Australia, New Zealand) group [01:30:05].
4.  **Consular Duties:** Potentially visiting Australians in trouble abroad, such as in jail [01:31:10].
5.  **Social Engagements:** Attending numerous lunches, cocktails, national day receptions, and dinners, which can be a significant "burden" [01:31:30]. Butler developed a quick exit strategy for UN receptions, shaking hands and making a brief comment before slipping out a side door [01:32:34].

## Reflections on Disarmament and Deterrence

### The Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons
In 1996, Paul Keating initiated the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, with Richard Butler serving as convener [02:08:06]. The commission, comprising 17 eminent experts from around the world, spent a year developing a "practical program for the elimination of nuclear weapons" [02:08:56].

The commission famously articulated a core syllogism on nuclear weapons, still widely recognized today:
1.  As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will one day be used by accident or design [02:10:13].
2.  Any use would be absolutely devastating to the whole world, from which recovery is unlikely [02:10:21].
3.  The only safe thing to do with nuclear weapons is to eliminate them [02:10:28]. This can be done through known means like test ban and fissile material cut-off treaties [02:10:38].

Joseph Rotblat, a Nobel Prize winner who walked out of the Manhattan Project when it became clear the bomb would be used on Japan, was a key member of this commission [02:13:36]. Butler believes Rotblat might have been behind the contention that nuclear weapons cannot exist indefinitely without being used [02:15:32].

### The Future of Proliferation and Deterrence
Butler cannot predict whether the number of nuclear weapon states will increase by 2040, as it depends on governments and the actions of existing nuclear powers [02:16:42]. He worries about countries adopting "authoritarian" or "semi-fascistic" views that might lead them to pursue nuclear weapons in their "national interest" [02:17:10]. He lists potential future proliferators as possibly European nations threatened by Russia (e.g., Germany, Baltic states) or Indonesia [02:19:40].

He firmly believes that nuclear deterrence is "illusory" and "nonsense" [02:21:48]. Acquiring nuclear weapons "would not be justified" for Australia, as it would merely incentivize rivals to do the same or more [02:21:31]. He also rejects the concept of "minimal deterrence" as an unhelpful distinction [00:34:46].

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:54">[02:18:54]</a>
> "Never forget the only country ever to have used nuclear weapons is the United States of America. Bear that in mind as history, as the current phase unfolds, in particular as the Trump period unfolds. They're the only ones who've done it and it was a terrible thing to have done."
> — Richard Butler

Butler expresses deep concern about the current state of global affairs, noting a widespread complacency about [[nuclear_proliferation_and_regional_security_dynamics_in_asia | proliferation breakouts]] [02:24:15]. He suggests this might be due to other pressing global issues like climate change and food supply, leading nuclear weapon states to assume they can manage their arsenals without new proliferation [02:24:43].

### Advice for Aspiring Diplomats
For young people interested in careers in nuclear disarmament, Butler emphasizes the importance of education in:
*   Nuclear Science and Technology [02:26:37].
*   International Politics and Law, especially multilateral aspects [02:26:45].
*   Relevant Foreign Languages [02:28:31].

He stresses the need for "properly educated" individuals in these fields, noting that traditionally, diplomatic service did not always attract people with such expertise [02:27:49]. Finally, he reiterates the crucial skill of **listening** and learning to **decipher** what is truly being said, as this positions one to be an effective international negotiator [02:28:56].

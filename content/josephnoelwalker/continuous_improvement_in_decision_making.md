Early in a grant selection process for "India winners," initial success rates were very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This led to a critical question from Tyler Cowen: "Are you taking enough risk? Where's the failure rate?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> This inquiry was unusual, as success typically goes unquestioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This type of questioning highlights [[the_role_of_uncorrelated_thinkers | the role of uncorrelated thinkers]] in challenging conventional wisdom.

## Assessing Risk in Grant Decisions

To address this, an assessment was conducted on all rejected grant applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The goal was to determine if rejections were due to projects being too risky or "out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

The findings revealed that rejections were not primarily due to the inherent riskiness of a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Instead, rejections often occurred because the applicant lacked a well-developed idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. More surprisingly, many projects were rejected for being "not risky enough" and deemed "cookie cutter" or "boring," indicating a lack of novelty or significant impact within [[innovation_and_technology_development | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This exercise helped confirm comfort with the level of risk being taken in the decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Strategies for Continuous Improvement

This process of reviewing past decisions is crucial for [[heuristics_and_biases_in_decision_making | continuous improvement in decision making]]. For new talent scouts, it is recommended to conduct a similar review exercise every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This involves:

*   Revisiting past rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   Evaluating if the rejection was the correct call at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Understanding the underlying reasons for the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   Assessing if the rationale still holds true after several months and additional grant cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This iterative process ensures that decision-makers are constantly refining their criteria and challenging their own [[heuristics_and_biases_in_decision_making | heuristics and biases]].

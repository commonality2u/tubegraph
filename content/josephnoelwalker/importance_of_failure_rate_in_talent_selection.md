In talent selection, a low failure rate among chosen candidates might not always indicate optimal performance. Instead, it could suggest that insufficient risk is being taken, leading to missed opportunities for groundbreaking projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Question of Risk

Early in a talent scouting role, a low failure rate among successful candidates prompted a crucial question: "Are you taking enough [[risk_assessment_in_talent_scouting | risk]]? Where's the failure rate?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> This query highlighted the need to proactively assess the level of risk in chosen projects, a perspective not commonly encountered when things appear to be going well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## [[evaluation_of_rejected_candidates | Re-evaluating Rejections]]

To address this, an assessment of rejected candidates was undertaken to understand the reasons for their non-selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This [[evaluation_of_rejected_candidates | re-evaluation]] revealed that rejections were rarely due to a project being too risky or "out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Instead, the primary reasons were:
*   The person not having a very fleshed-out idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   The project not being risky enough; often, it was too "cookie cutter" or unoriginal, posing the question of whether another similar idea was truly needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

This introspection confirmed that the level of [[risk_assessment_in_talent_scouting | risk]] being taken was appropriate for the context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Ongoing Assessment for Talent Scouts

For new talent scouts, it is beneficial to regularly perform this exercise of reviewing rejected candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. An ongoing [[importance_of_reevaluation_in_project_selection | re-evaluation]] every six months helps to:
*   Re-assess the initial call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Understand the rationale behind past decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   Determine if initial feelings about a rejection still hold true after gaining more experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This continuous [[evaluation_of_rejected_candidates | re-evaluation]] ensures that the selection process is not only effective but also takes appropriate levels of [[risk_assessment_in_talent_scouting | risk]], potentially fostering more innovative and impactful selections.

The strategic relationship between the United States and China is a significant topic of discussion, particularly concerning American policy and public engagement. Sam Rogavin, director of the Lowy Institute's international security program, has argued that the US may not fight China for strategic dominance in Asia because it lacks vital interests in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## US Interests in Asia and the Challenge of China

Sam Rogavin's perspective highlights a perceived absence of a declared [[americas_national_mission_regarding_chinas_rise | national mission]] in the United States regarding China's rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Despite China's emergence as a great power since the early post-Cold War years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, no American president has explicitly stated that countering China is the nation's primary mission, requiring a whole-of-nation effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Comparison to Historical Threats

The challenge posed by China is considered to be economically larger than that of Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Furthermore, China's economy is well past 60% of American GDP, making it a bigger challenge than the [[comparison_of_chinas_challenge_to_historical_threats_like_cold_war_and_world_war_ii | Cold War]] in most respects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. A whole-of-nation effort, even larger than that of the Cold War, would be required to address this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## [[lack_of_intellectual_and_popular_cultural_engagement_with_chinas_challenge | Lack of Engagement on China Challenge]] in the US

A key observation regarding the [[assessment_of_americas_preparedness_for_a_contest_with_china | United States' preparedness for a contest with China]] is the [[role_of_american_intellectuals_and_media_in_addressing the_china_challenge | limited intellectual and popular cultural engagement]] with the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the "all-consuming anti-Soviet mindset" of the Cold War era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Prominent popular commentators, such as Joe Rogan, are not observed to be "obsessed with China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. While foreign policy establishments, including journals like *Foreign Affairs*, publish numerous articles on the China challenge and threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, this engagement does not extend widely beyond the "beltway crowd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Major columnists and authors, such as David Brooks and Ross Douthat, are not writing books about the China challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

This lack of broad intellectual ferment and public interest indicates that the United States may not be primed for a contest of this scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, unlike during the Cold War where "cold war liberalism" became an entire school of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, or even the War on Terrorism, which saw widespread intellectual and media focus on maintaining liberal democracy against radical Islamist threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

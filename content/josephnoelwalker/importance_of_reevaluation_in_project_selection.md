Reevaluation of past decisions is a crucial exercise in talent selection and project development, allowing for a better understanding of [[risk_assessment_in_talent_scouting | risk]] parameters and the effectiveness of initial judgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This process helps ensure that a talent scout or grant picker is taking an appropriate amount of [[risk_assessment_in_talent_scouting | risk]] and not unduly rejecting valuable, unconventional ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Identifying the Need for Reevaluation

The concept of reevaluation was highlighted when a talent scout's successful picks prompted a question about the [[importance_of_failure_rate_in_talent_selection | failure rate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This unusual inquiry, coming when things appeared to be going well, emphasized the need to actively assess whether enough [[risk_assessment_in_talent_scouting | risk]] was being undertaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Process of Reevaluating Rejections

A key method of reevaluation involves looking back at [[evaluation_of_rejected_candidates | individuals or projects that did not receive grants]] or selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The goal is to understand the reasons for rejection, specifically questioning if it was due to the project being too [[risk_assessment_in_talent_scouting | risky]] or "too out there," or if other issues were at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

> When reviewing past [[evaluation_of_rejected_candidates | rejections]], consider:
> *   Was the initial call the right one? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
> *   Why was that decision made? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
> *   Do the reasons for rejection still hold true after more experience and time (e.g., six months later)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

## Findings from Reevaluation

In one instance, a reevaluation revealed that none of the rejections were due to the project being excessively [[risk_assessment_in_talent_scouting | risky]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Instead, rejections were often because the applicant's idea was not sufficiently developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, or ironically, the project was "too cookie cutter boring" and not [[risk_assessment_in_talent_scouting | risky]] enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This insight helped confirm comfort with the level of [[risk_assessment_in_talent_scouting | risk]] being undertaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Continuous Practice

For new talent scouts, it is recommended to regularly perform this reevaluation exercise, ideally every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This continuous process of reviewing [[evaluation_of_rejected_candidates | rejections]] and the reasoning behind them helps refine judgment and ensures an appropriate balance of [[risk_assessment_in_talent_scouting | risk-taking]] in future selections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Australia is recognized as having one of the highest levels of [[state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | state capacity]] in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This assessment comes from a literature review conducted in preparation for a discussion on the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Key Factors Contributing to High State Capacity

Several factors contribute to Australia's high [[state_capacity_and_government_efficiency | state capacity]] and effective government:

### High Public Expectations
Australians generally hold high expectations for the performance of their administrative state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Services like Service New South Wales or Medicare are expected to "come out of the box and work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. If these services fail, politicians face significant repercussions, leading to strong political incentives for efficient service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This contrasts sharply with countries like the US, where public expectations for government efficiency are much lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

### Efficient Political System
[[australias_electoral_system_and_its_uniqueness | Australia's political system]] is structured in a way that minimizes barriers to implementing policy and legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. The legislature and the executive are effectively intertwined, unlike systems such as that in the US, which is designed to prevent the rapid passage of legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. This lower "friction" in the Australian system allows for quicker delivery of services and changes that align with public preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

### Egalitarian Culture and Shared Stake in Public Services
Australia's egalitarian culture plays a crucial role, as wealthy individuals are less likely to "opt out" of public services compared to their counterparts in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. For instance, most wealthy Australians utilize Medicare and often send their children to local public schools for at least some years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. This shared reliance on public systems ensures that a broad spectrum of society, including those with more influence or time, maintains a vested interest in the quality and functionality of these services, creating continuous pressure for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

### Historical Roots of Trust in Government
Australia's unique history fostered a benign view of government. For roughly the first century of the colony, the British government largely funded Australia's governance, meaning taxation was comparatively low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>. Unlike America's experience with "taxation without representation," Australians viewed government as a provider of services without significant direct cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

Colonial governments were also primarily responsible for developing essential infrastructure like railways, roads, and ports, borrowing money to build the colony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. This active role in providing necessary infrastructure for productive life cultivated a sense of trust in government as a benevolent entity rather than a potentially oppressive one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. Additionally, government-assisted migration further deepened this reliance and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>.

## Overall Standing

Some analysis suggests that if raw spending levels are excluded from the measurement of state capacity, Australia might even rank as number one globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This indicates that Australia is exceptionally effective at achieving its policy goals once a political decision has been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

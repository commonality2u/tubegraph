Easy access to credit, particularly for housing, was initially seen as a beneficial way to improve individual wealth and financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Intentions and Perceived Benefits

The idea behind making credit easier was to allow more people to purchase homes and benefit from house appreciation, thereby increasing their personal wealth and portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This approach aimed to alleviate anxieties related to inadequate job security or human capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. It was also considered positive to increase the number of property owners within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Both conservative and progressive viewpoints converged on the belief that expanding [[housing_credit_expansion | housing credit]] was a positive step, with the right valuing property ownership and the left desiring workers to own their homes and become wealthier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

## Risks and Negative Consequences

While the expansion of credit was considered a good idea within limits, it evolved into a movement that extended too far, leading to significant harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
Too much credit, pushed too easily, can harm even the recipients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. This harm can occur when individuals acquire credit at the wrong time, particularly as prices are rapidly increasing, making houses unaffordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Debt Trap
> People might draw down on their home equity lines for consumption, only to find that prices collapse, eliminating their equity and leaving them deeply in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## Political Pressure and Debt Illusion

There was significant [[political_pressure_and_credit_availability | political pressure]] on politicians to address stagnant incomes, and expanding housing credit was seen as a way to keep people content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. When incomes are not growing, increased consumption can only be achieved through [[home_equity_and_debt_illusion | debt or equity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Easy credit provided an [[home_equity_and_debt_illusion | illusion]] that people were not borrowing because their home prices were rising, making it seem as though they were merely drawing down on existing equity rather than taking on new loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. This perception made "draw down" sound more favorable than "borrowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. In reality, individuals were borrowing against an appreciation that became increasingly fragile, based on a [[risks_of_a_housing_market_bubble | market bubble]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

Australian immigration policy over the past few decades has been primarily driven by demographic objectives, specifically to slow the rate of population aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>.

## Historical Objectives of Immigration Policy

According to former deputy secretary of the Department of Immigration, Abal Risby, the initial objective of Australia's immigration policy, dating back to Arthur Calwell's post-war migration program, was demography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:41">[02:40:41]</a>. The aim was to slow the rate of population aging over the next 50 to 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>. While Australia's population will still age, slowing this rate allows for better adjustment processes for businesses and government agencies compared to countries experiencing very rapid aging, such as China, Japan, South Korea, or much of Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:13">[03:10:13]</a>.

### The 2001 Policy Changes

The significant [[australian_immigration_policy_changes_in_2001 | 2001 changes]] that substantially increased Australia's intake of skilled migrants, particularly [[role_of_international_students_in_australian_immigration | overseas students]], were motivated approximately 80% by demographic concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:13">[03:11:13]</a>. An additional 10% of the motivation came from pressure from universities seeking to generate income through international education programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:12">[03:11:12]</a>. This international education program offered multiple benefits: it contributed skills to Australia, generated export income, helped slow the rate of aging, and provided a budget benefit, making it an attractive policy for the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:33">[03:11:33]</a>.

## Immigration and Housing Affordability

While immigration policy has aimed to manage [[population_growth_and_sustainable_development_in_australia | population growth]] and aging, high levels of immigration over the past two decades have interacted with an inelastic housing supply to push up house prices, contributing to a [[housing_affordability_crisis_in_australia | housing affordability crisis]] in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:50">[03:51:50]</a>. This illustrates the complex [[the_relationship_between_immigration_housing_and_economic_growth | relationship between immigration, housing, and economic growth]].

Even with an extremely ambitious supply-side policy, such as the national cabinet's target of 1.2 million homes over five years (which is 200,000 above a neutral baseline), the reduction in housing affordability would only be about 5% relative to a counterfactual where prices continue to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:57">[03:57:57]</a>. Resolving the [[housing_affordability_crisis_in_australia | housing crisis]] by focusing solely on supply is a long-term endeavor; a substantial increase in the housing stock (10-20% to achieve significant price falls of 40%) would take 10 to 20 years, even with an extremely ambitious annual increase in supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:14">[03:17:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:10">[03:41:10]</a>.

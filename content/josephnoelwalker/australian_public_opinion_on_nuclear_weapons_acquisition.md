Recent polling indicates a surprising level of support among Australians for the country acquiring its own nuclear weapons.

### Shifting Public Sentiment

A 2022 poll conducted by the Lowy Institute revealed that approximately 36% of Australians either support or strongly support Australia acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This finding was unexpected by some, though less surprising after the announcement of the [[Implications of the AUKUS agreement on nuclear power | AUKUS agreement]] in August 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

Historically, [[Australias historical antinuclear stance | Australia has a strong anti-nuclear history]], particularly visible in the 1980s with campaigns led by figures like Peter Garrett and the Greens Party against [[Australia and nuclear power | nuclear power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Despite this, when the [[Implications of the AUKUS agreement on nuclear power | AUKUS agreement]] was announced by the Morrison government in September 2021, the expected popular opposition to [[Australia and nuclear power | nuclear power]] did not materialise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This suggests Australians have become more relaxed about [[Australia and nuclear power | nuclear power]] than previously assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, a shift that likely influenced the opposition party's decision to propose civilian [[Australia and nuclear power | nuclear power]] as an election promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Interpretation of Poll Results

One interpretation of the [[Public opinion on nuclear weapons | poll results]] is that questions about nuclear weapons acquisition are often presented without considering counterfactuals or associated costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This might lead respondents to support the idea without fully considering the implications, suggesting they "haven't thought it through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Preconditions for Australia's Nuclear Acquisition

For Australia to be justified in considering acquiring its own nuclear weapons, several preconditions would likely need to be met:

1.  **Regional Proliferation First**: It is considered highly improbable that Australia would develop nuclear weapons before other regional powers, specifically Japan and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. These countries face more acute security dilemmas with China due to their proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Taiwan is unlikely to pursue nuclear weapons due to the difficulty of keeping such a program secret from Chinese intelligence and the immediate invasion it would provoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. However, South Korea and Japan might consider this option if American withdrawal was imminent or if they lost faith in the [[Credibility of American extended nuclear deterrence | extended nuclear deterrent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
2.  **Indonesian Acquiescence**: Indonesia's approval or, preferably, cooperation, would be crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Without it, the problems created with Indonesia by acquiring nuclear weapons would outweigh any security issues Australia might be trying to solve with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### [[Credibility of American extended nuclear deterrence | Credibility of American Extended Nuclear Deterrence]]

The rationale for a country like Australia to acquire nuclear weapons often stems from doubts about the [[Credibility of American extended nuclear deterrence | credibility of American extended nuclear deterrence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The US pledges to use its nuclear weapons in defence of allies threatened with nuclear attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, aiming to prevent allies from developing their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

However, the emergence of North Korea's Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) capable of striking US cities has altered this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The bargain now implies the US would risk one or more of its own cities being destroyed to defend an ally like South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This is considered "not credible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a> and an "impossible thing to ask of the Americans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, as it goes against their vital interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. South Korea appears to have drawn this conclusion and is developing more independent capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Australia and Japan, in contrast, have largely opted to further integrate with the US alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### The Nuclear Taboo and [[Nuclear blackmail and its impact on international relations | Nuclear Blackmail]]

Despite concerns about the [[Credibility of American extended nuclear deterrence | credibility of extended deterrence]], some argue that Australia would be unlikely to face a direct nuclear threat. The global culture against nuclear use is incredibly strong, representing a "difficult taboo to break" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Australia, being a relatively small nation, would not be the country that China would likely choose to break this taboo against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

However, the greater concern for Australia might be [[Nuclear blackmail and its impact on international relations | nuclear blackmail]], where a country like China threatens nuclear use to compel Australia's acquiescence without actual detonation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This has historical precedent, such as Russia's threats to deter NATO intervention in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, or the US using similar threats to prevent China from invading Taiwan in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

The effectiveness of [[Nuclear blackmail and its impact on international relations | nuclear blackmail]] hinges on the belief in the threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. While the consequences of a nuclear strike are enormous, even a small probability can influence decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. The argument for Australia to call the bluff is that China would never actually use nuclear weapons, rendering such threats incredible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. However, this carries inherent risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Ultimately, becoming a nuclear weapons power itself would also impose huge costs on Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

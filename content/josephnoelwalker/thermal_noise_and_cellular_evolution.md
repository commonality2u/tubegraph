A fundamental characteristic of a cell is that it operates as a "bag of molecules that's being shaken all the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In this environment, nothing is guaranteed a particular location unless it is very strongly bonded to that place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This mode of operation is distinctly different from how humans typically design objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## [[randomization_of_molecular_motion | Molecular Motion]] and Cryopreservation

The inherent randomness within cells helps explain the possibility of cryopreservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It is considered "incredibly strange" that anything can be cryopreserved and subsequently rewarmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

For instance, in cryopreservation, resected brain tissue might be cooled to minus 130Â°C and below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The process of cryopreservation is akin to taking a complex factory, stopping everyone, spinning them around, and having them walk in random directions; it "randomizes the [[randomization_of_molecular_motion | molecular motion]] of all the molecules" at very low temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## [[invariance_of_cells_to_environmental_changes | Cellular Invariance]]

Unlike most human-built systems, which are largely incompatible with such randomization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, cells exhibit an [[invariance_of_cells_to_environmental_changes | invariance]] to this kind of disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Cells fundamentally run on passive diffusion, meaning molecules bounce about in random directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Evolutionary Adaptation to Thermal Noise

The success of cryopreservation is linked to the fact that cells have evolved to function with "very high amounts of thermal noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This evolutionary adaptation has endowed cells with properties that make them highly proficient at being [[invariance_of_cells_to_environmental_changes | invariant to the randomization induced by cryopreservation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It would be highly unusual to expect similar invariance in any other system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

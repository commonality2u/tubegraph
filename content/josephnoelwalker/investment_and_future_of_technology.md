The year 2020 has accelerated thinking due to increased reliance on technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. Technology has become essential, enabling activities like funerals to occur remotely when physical gatherings are not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. This reliance is profoundly "reworking us as a species" in terms of how humans interact and communicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

## Economic Stagnation and its Causes
The United States, once seen as a leader in [[innovation_and_technology_development | innovation and growth]], has shifted its focus. The "center of the country politically" moved from encouraging [[innovation_and_technology_development | innovation and actual growth]] to a mindset of "stealing from other people" because the economic "pie is growing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. This shift occurred because when the pie stops growing, gaining a larger slice means another's slice must shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>.

Ian Macfarlane, former governor of Australia's central bank, described the current economy as "anti-growth," which is a shocking observation given Australia's past prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:18:00">[24:18:00]</a>. This perspective highlights a concern that it will "take decades for the technologies to catch up" if new ones are even created, leaving society to "fight over the scraps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>.

### Productivity Growth and "Fake Businesses"
A significant factor contributing to this economic derangement is the stagnation of productivity growth since the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>. This lack of growth leads to a lack of motivation to remain in a rigorous mindset, akin to athletes not staying in shape without a game to play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:00">[19:48:00]</a>. This environment fosters "fake businesses" and "fake political agendas," where everything becomes performative or "kayfabe and fakery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">[20:27:00]</a>. Most businesses today are seen as having a "largely fake aspect to them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>.

### The "Miraculous Run" of 1920-1970
Economist Robert Gordon questions why productivity growth stagnated after 1970, and instead asks what accounted for the "miraculous run of productivity growth between 1920 and 1970" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:57:00">[34:57:00]</a>. This period saw the "last gains" of the second industrial revolution (from 1870) and significant transformations in daily life, such as indoor plumbing, electricity, the motor car, air travel, and frozen food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:11:00">[35:11:00]</a>. This era was characterized by "umwelt hacking," using tools to perceive the world with greater resolution, like telescopes to see celestial bodies or high-speed photography to slow down time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:45">[01:38:45]</a>. The germ model of disease, cat scans, and functional MRI are examples of how these tools expanded human perception and understanding, leading to industrial applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:16">[01:40:16]</a>. However, this particular "orchard" of umwelt hacking has largely come to an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:58">[01:40:58]</a>, as many modern discoveries, like quarks or colliding black holes, lack immediate industrial application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:36">[01:41:36]</a>.

## Investment in Technology
The current method of funding tomorrow's advancements, particularly through venture capital, is deemed "probably not the best way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:56">[02:00:56]</a>. Often, venture capitalists fund startups by "betting on the jockey, not the horse," meaning they trust the entrepreneur without fully understanding the underlying technology or science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:41">[02:01:41]</a>. While there was a "novel period" where listening to "weirdos" (contrarians) was a successful strategy, this has saturated, and current techniques are no longer as effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:17">[02:02:17]</a>.

Historically, governments played a crucial role in finding "new territories" or "orchards" of discovery, as they possess the immense resources required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:53">[02:02:53]</a>. Modern billionaires are seen as "radically underperforming" in this regard, with few investing in truly original initiatives like new universities or institutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:36">[02:03:36]</a>. Elon Musk is an exception, but many others fail to honor the possibility of doing something amazing with their wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:54">[02:04:54]</a>.

## The Future: Escaping Earth and Beyond Physics
The release of the power of the cell and the atom—the "twin nuclei problem"—possesses enough destructive force to "wipe us out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. Concerns also exist about the virus being connected to "investigation, tinkering, weaponization laboratories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. These developments have led to a "death sentence" for humanity, as physicists gave us the ability to unlock fusion and split the atom but did not provide a means of escape from Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:21">[01:50:21]</a>. This includes the development of molecular biology, which was largely advanced by physicists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:38">[01:57:38]</a>.

### The Einsteinian Speed Limit and Escape
The "Einsteinian speed limit," stating that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum, means that reaching distant parts of the universe, which are "light years away," would take "at least ten thousand years" if they are ten thousand light-years away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:31">[01:53:31]</a>. This effectively traps humanity on Earth, which is metaphorically described as a "prison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:29">[01:58:29]</a>.

The hope for escape lies in the possibility that Einstein's rules are not fundamental. The "Schwarzschild solution" and the "Robertson-Walker-Friedman solution" of Einstein's equations indicate "singularities" or "flaws," suggesting that the theory is not the "last word" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:39">[01:54:39]</a>. The greatest hope for survival lies in going "beyond Einstein" to discover new physics that might allow for interstellar travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:30">[01:55:30]</a>.

This implies that humanity must "double down on the thing that's already going to kill you" to have hope of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:22">[01:56:22]</a>.

> "We are running one global experiment. If something happens on Twitter, it happens to all of us effectively. And we need to now start running uncorrelated experiments, because not all human experiments are going to work. And I want to repeat that so people heard it: not all human experiments are going to work. If we run one correlated experiment, we are signing our own death warrant." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:26">[01:44:26]</a>

This global interconnectedness means that [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_technology | existential risks]] like pandemics, nuclear accidents, or environmental catastrophes can propagate throughout the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:59">[01:44:59]</a>. To mitigate these risks, humanity must diversify its "portfolio" by colonizing other planets and even other star systems, requiring breakthroughs in theoretical physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:08">[01:45:08]</a>.

## Optimism and the Role of Individuals
Despite the challenges, there is hope. The "stasis is over," and society is entering a period of "serious crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>. This vacuum is expected to produce "remarkable individuals" who can lead through these turbulent times, as collective action is not seen as the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:36">[02:06:36]</a>. Instead, "freaks" and "weirdos" and "artists" are the hope for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:50">[02:06:50]</a>. True progressives are those who take markets seriously, as markets lift people out of poverty and provide agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:01">[02:08:01]</a>. The "human outlier"—the "kurtosis of the human species"—is where most significant change originates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:45">[02:11:45]</a>.

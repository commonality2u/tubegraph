Australia's immigration policy in the 21st century has been profoundly shaped by international students, who now represent a significant portion of annual net migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. This reliance began with consequential policy decisions in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Historical Context: The 2001 Howard Government Changes

In 2001, the Howard government implemented a series of regulatory [[australian_immigration_policy_changes_in_2001 | changes to immigration policy]] that dramatically increased Australia's immigration intake to levels not seen since the post-World War II "populate and perish" era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The government sought to increase migrant numbers without compromising on skill levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The innovative solution was a massive expansion of the intake of international students and working holiday makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The intention was for these individuals to come to Australia, upskill, and then be offered the chance to apply for permanent residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

This decision proved successful, with over 2 million international students and working holiday makers arriving in Australia in the two decades since, many of whom settled permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. In recent years, international students have accounted for more than 40% of annual net migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. It is argued that today, Australian immigration policy largely "boils down to decisions about International students" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Policy Motivation: Demography and Education Exports
The primary motivation for these 2001 changes was largely demographic, aimed at slowing the rate of [[australian_immigration_policy_and_population_aging | population aging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Approximately 80% of the decision was driven by demography, with an additional 10% influenced by pressure from universities seeking funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>.

The expansion of the International Education Program provided a means for universities to generate income and simultaneously contributed skills to Australia, generated export income, and helped slow [[australian_immigration_policy_and_population_aging | population aging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>. This policy was considered a "stroke of Australian policy genius" due to its multi-faceted benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:53]</a>. Education quickly grew to become Australia's third-largest export, raising living standards for all Australians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. The full extent of this growth, however, surprised policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.

## Challenges and Issues

### Loss of Government Control over Numbers
A key misconception about [[impact_of_immigration_on_the_australian_economy_and_demography | immigration policy]] is the extent of day-to-day government control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The effects of policy changes typically take years to manifest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Net overseas migration, which includes both permanent and temporary programs, is the relevant metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. While the permanent program is capped by the government, the temporary program (including international students and working holiday makers) is demand-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This demand-driven nature means that if temporary migration blows out, net migration can also blow out, leading to a perceived "loss of control" over numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Policy decisions made during and before the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a significant boom in net migration, which the Albanese government was slow to respond to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

#### The "Genuine Student" Criterion
A significant flaw in the current system is the "genuine student" criterion for visa applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. This is described as a "highly subjective criterion" leading to uncertain decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a>. Decisions vary based on the perceived risk level of the education provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:56">[01:34:56]</a>, with students attending more reputable institutions facing less scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02">[01:34:02]</a>. This approach is criticized for its subjectivity, inconsistency, and bureaucratic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:25">[01:34:25]</a>.

### Impact on Housing
International students do have an impact on the housing market, particularly near universities in central business districts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>. However, their impact on suburban housing is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:23">[01:33:23]</a>, and rising housing costs are largely attributed to many other factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:49">[01:33:49]</a>. While they are allowed to purchase homes through the foreign investment review board process, most international students cannot afford housing in major cities like Sydney or Melbourne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:16">[01:34:16]</a>.

### Exploitation of Migrant Workers
Temporary migrants, including international students, often face exploitation such as wage theft and insufficient reimbursement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:01">[01:24:01]</a>. The system is seen by some as baking in exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>. While penalties for exploitation, including criminal penalties, have been introduced, the criteria for conviction are still considered too opaque, making it difficult to penalize employers effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>. Freezing the minimum wage for employer-sponsored visas between 2013 and 2022 also increased the risk of exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:56">[01:26:56]</a>.

## Policy Recommendations

### Standardized Entrance Exams for Student Visas
To address issues with the "genuine student" criterion and control numbers, a standardized entrance exam for overseas students is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>. Passing the exam would almost guarantee a visa, while failing would lead to refusal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:47">[01:31:47]</a>. This approach is seen as more efficient, objective, and fair, providing certainty to students and enabling more sensible government control over numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:55">[01:35:55]</a>.

### Combating Exploitation
To minimize exploitation, policy should focus on empowering individual migrants and strengthening protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>. Recent changes that allow employer-sponsored migrants to change employers more easily help empower migrants and reduce the employer's capacity for exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:52">[01:24:52]</a>. There is a need to revisit exploitation penalties to ensure genuine fear of consequences beyond minor fines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:56">[01:25:56]</a>. Empowering unions to assist temporary migrants and encouraging union membership could also help reduce exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:25">[01:27:25]</a>.

### Rebuilding [[state_capability_and_policy_efficacy_in_australia | State Capability]] in Immigration
Australia's historic success in managing immigration was partly due to its unique, long-standing Department of Immigration (1945-2015/16) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This department was largely staffed by career immigration officials, fostering corporate memory and a "nation building" culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>. However, since its integration into Home Affairs in 2015-16, the department's focus shifted towards law enforcement and national security, with recruitment increasingly prioritizing defense and law enforcement backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:15">[01:20:15]</a>. To restore effectiveness, there is a call to recruit individuals who genuinely wish to work in immigration for the purpose of [[population_growth_and_sustainable_development_in_australia | nation building]] and Australia's future development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:14">[01:23:14]</a>, rather than primarily focusing on law enforcement.

## Conclusion

International students have become a cornerstone of Australia's [[impact_of_immigration_on_the_australian_economy_and_demography | immigration policy]], contributing significantly to population growth and the [[economic_benefits_of_immigration | economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. While their integration has largely been successful due to bipartisan political support for multiculturalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:59">[01:55:59]</a> and potentially shared "WEIRD" (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) cultural beliefs among skilled migrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>, challenges remain regarding the management of temporary migration, housing impacts, and the prevention of migrant exploitation. Continuous policy refinement and a clear national [[population_growth_and_sustainable_development_in_australia | population plan]] are crucial to ensure sustainable and beneficial immigration outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.

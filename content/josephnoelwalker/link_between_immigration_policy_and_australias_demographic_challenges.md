Australia's immigration policy underwent a significant, yet largely unnoticed, transformation in 2001 under the Howard government. These regulatory changes dramatically increased Australia's immigration intake to levels not seen since the post-World War II era [00:00:17]. This policy shift is considered one of the most consequential decisions Australia has made in the 21st century [00:00:08].

To maintain the skill level of migrants while increasing intake, an "innovative solution" was implemented: a massive expansion of the intake of [[role_of_international_students_in_australias_immigration_system | international students]] and working holiday makers [00:00:41]. The intention was for these individuals to upskill in Australia and then have the opportunity to apply for permanent residency [00:00:50]. This approach has been successful, with over 2 million [[role_of_international_students_in_australias_immigration_system | international students]] and working holiday makers arriving in Australia over the subsequent two decades, many settling permanently [00:01:00]. In recent years, [[role_of_international_students_in_australias_immigration_system | international students]] have accounted for over 40% of annual net migration [00:01:10].

## Australia's Demographic Landscape and Immigration's Role

Modern Australia would be "unrecognizable without immigration" [00:01:27]. Approximately 30% of Australia's population was born overseas, which is believed to be the highest rate in the developed world [00:01:30]. This has contributed to Australia having one of the youngest and most multicultural populations in the developed world [00:01:35].

A thought experiment suggests that without the mass migration program since the end of World War II, Australia's population would be significantly smaller, likely under 10 million [00:03:55]. The median age would be much older, around 47-48 years, compared to the current 37-38 years [00:04:05]. Furthermore, the number of deaths would far outweigh births, leading to a population that is "older, smaller and shrinking" [0004:42]. In such a scenario, Australia would demographically resemble Japan [00:04:51].

### The Primary Objective of Immigration Policy

According to one expert, the initial and primary objective of Australia's immigration policy should be to slow the rate at which the population ages over the next 50 to 100 years [00:10:53]. While Australia will continue to age, slowing this rate allows for better adjustment compared to countries like China, Japan, South Korea, or much of Western Europe, which are aging at a much faster pace [00:11:12]. This demographic objective was a key motivation when the post-war migration program was initiated [00:11:41].

When advising on the transformative 2001 policy changes, approximately 80% of the decision was driven by demographic considerations [00:12:06]. Another 10% came from pressure from universities seeking funding by expanding the international education program [00:12:12]. The expansion of [[role_of_international_students_in_australias_immigration_system | international education]] was seen as the best way to increase the migration program, contributing skills and export income to Australia, slowing the rate of aging, and providing a budget benefit [00:12:34].

## Government Control and Public Perception

There is a common misconception that the government has day-to-day control over migration levels [00:05:20]. Policy changes typically take one to five years for their effects to become apparent [00:05:32]. The recent "huge boom" in net migration was largely a result of policy decisions made during the COVID-19 pandemic and prior [00:05:53]. While the Albanese government might be criticized for not responding quickly enough, the situation reflects fault on both major parties [00:06:12].

Net overseas migration (NOM) is the relevant metric, defined as people entering or leaving the country for 12 out of 16 months [00:07:11]. The government only caps the permanent migration program; the temporary program (which includes [[role_of_international_students_in_australias_immigration_system | international students]] and working holiday makers) is demand-driven and accounts for a larger portion of overall net migration [00:07:30]. Other groups affecting NOM include New Zealand citizens (the largest temporary migrant group in Australia at around 700,000 [00:08:14]), and Australian citizens moving long-term overseas or returning [00:08:25].

A crucial factor for maintaining public support for immigration is the perception of [[government_control_and_public_perception_of_immigration_in_australia | government control]] [00:42:46]. When net migration appears "out of control," as it did recently, public attitudes against migration tend to rise [00:43:03]. This leads to concerns about the capacity of infrastructure and service delivery to keep up [00:43:19]. Therefore, it is advisable for any government to be restrained, keeping net migration in the optimum range (e.g., 200,000-250,000 per year) for slowing aging [00:43:31].

### Managing Unauthorized Migrants

Australia faces a challenge with approximately 100,000 people who have exhausted their visa options and should no longer be in the country [00:20:01]. This situation originated around 2015-2016 with a labor trafficking scam, where a significant number of asylum applications emerged, predominantly from Malaysian and Chinese nationals [00:21:10]. The lack of a timely government response allowed this scam to grow until international borders closed during COVID-19 [00:21:44].

To address this, strategies involve slowing the application rate by adequately resourcing primary decision-makers to process applications quickly, preventing organizers from benefiting from work rights [00:23:14]. The Labor government has invested in faster processing for both primary applications and administrative review tribunals [00:23:50]. There are also efforts to pursue and prosecute organizers of these scams [00:24:15].

For the significant number of people (40,000-60,000 and growing) who have been refused visas but are not leaving, mass deportation is deemed impractical and costly [00:24:32]. It would involve immense financial cost, lead to many mistakes, disrupt the economy, and ultimately fail [00:25:12]. The biggest component of this cost would be the detention capacity required, potentially leading to large, temporary, and inhumane "barbwire camps" [00:26:27].

Many of these individuals, particularly those from the scams, were manipulated and are now working and have established community ties in Australia [00:27:18]. A "subtle way to give them a pathway to permanent residence" is suggested, despite potential political criticism of it being an "amnesty" [00:27:35]. The costs of mass deportation would far outweigh any political cost of such an approach [00:28:04]. Historically, Australia implemented a similar measure in 1993, granting a unique "one November" visa category to 40,000-50,000 Chinese students who were not expected to return home [00:29:33]. The children of these migrants have shown to be very successful [00:30:29].

## Fertility Decline

Australia's total fertility rate (average births per woman) dropped below replacement level (around 2.1 children per woman) in 1976 and currently stands at about 1.5 [00:37:07]. Immigration's role in slowing population aging is primarily through the intake of young migrants who contribute to births [00:37:34].

If net migration were cut to zero, Australia would likely reach "natural decrease" (deaths exceeding births) in about 15 years [00:38:03]. This is relatively good compared to Canada, which would reach that point within a year or two under the same conditions [00:38:33]. If Australia maintains its current high levels of net migration (e.g., 200,000 per year) and the fertility rate stabilizes at 1.5, natural decrease could be delayed until closer to the end of the century [00:39:00]. This would make Australia the last developed nation to reach that point [00:39:33].

However, immigration only slows the rate of population aging; it doesn't reverse it, as immigrants themselves age [00:41:29]. There are diminishing returns to increasing net migration for the purpose of slowing aging [00:41:17]. Research from Peter McDonald suggests an optimum net migration level of around 200,000 (when fertility was 1.8), which might now be closer to 225,000-250,000 due to lower fertility rates [00:42:18].

Key drivers of fertility decline since World War II include the accessibility and affordability of contraception and the education of girls [00:48:56]. While these are the biggest drivers, financial capacity is also a factor [00:49:20]. In Australia, after housing, childcare costs are the next biggest challenge for young couples, affecting fertility decisions [00:49:40].

## Acculturation and Social Cohesion

Australia is a highly multicultural developed nation, with a greater spread of nationalities than most other countries [00:51:37]. The high rates of social cohesion despite 30% of the population being born overseas are seen as a "miracle" [00:51:52].

A key factor in Australia's success with acculturation and multiculturalism has been bipartisan political support for immigration since 1945 [00:52:30]. Leaders like Arthur Calwell, Robert Menzies, Gough Whitlam, Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke, and even John Howard, Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull, and Scott Morrison, despite varying approaches, have generally maintained this support [00:53:11]. This sustained political consensus, along with Settlement Services developed in the late 1970s, has been crucial [00:53:22].

It's hypothesized that Australia's success in acculturation might also stem from the "weird" (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) mindset shared by many high-skilled migrants [00:56:56]. Higher education, even primary and secondary education, downloads a specific set of cultural beliefs [00:57:26]. This shared way of thinking, particularly for those who come to Australia for university during their formative years, could contribute to successful integration [00:58:18].

## Link to Housing and the Economy

Immigration contributes to the demand side of the housing market [00:01:57]. [[role_of_international_students_in_australias_immigration_system | International students]] undoubtedly impact housing, especially near universities and in CBD areas [00:33:04]. Working holiday makers affect backpacker hostel accommodation [00:33:18]. However, their impact is minimal in suburban Australia where major housing complaints often originate [00:33:23]. While it's "easy to blame immigrants" for housing issues, many other factors are at play [00:33:48]. Most [[role_of_international_students_in_australias_immigration_system | international students]] rent or live in student accommodation and would not be able to afford homes in major cities [00:34:04].

Regarding the [[relationship_between_immigration_and_housing | impact of migrants on local wages]], there isn't a simple answer [00:35:06]. Immigrants influence both demand and supply in the labor market [00:35:15]. While an oversupply of labor in specific sectors could theoretically depress wages, areas like aged care and healthcare, which heavily rely on migrants, currently face significant vacancies rather than oversupply [00:35:40]. High-skilled migration can be beneficial for the economy as it often creates a need for lower-skilled support staff [01:13:43].

## Challenges and Future Considerations

One significant challenge has been the rise of exploitation and abuse in low-skill visa programs [01:15:03]. While policies enabling migrants to move employers more easily can help empower individuals, penalties for exploitation are still often inadequate [01:24:52]. Freezing the minimum wage for employer-sponsored visas in the past increased the risk of exploitation [01:26:56]. Empowering unions to assist and protect temporary migrants and students is also suggested as a measure to reduce exploitation [01:27:31].

A critical missing element in Australia's immigration policy is a comprehensive "population plan" that outlines future population goals [01:11:31]. Historically, Australia has lacked such a forward-looking plan [01:11:51].

From 1945 until around 2015-2016, Australia had a unique standalone immigration department primarily focused on "nation building" [01:19:00]. This department was staffed by long-serving individuals with deep corporate memory [01:19:27]. However, after 2015-2016, the department transitioned to a "Home Affairs" model, with a shift in focus to national security and law enforcement, and a corresponding change in recruitment, leading to a decline in dedicated immigration research [01:20:34].

To ensure continued success, it is important to recruit individuals who genuinely want to work in immigration for the purpose of "nation building" and developing Australia's future, drawing from a wide range of qualifications rather than being dominated by defense or law enforcement backgrounds [01:23:09].

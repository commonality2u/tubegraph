In 2023, historian Richard Rhodes discussed the relative success of [[nuclear_nonproliferation_and_its_historical_context | nuclear nonproliferation]], noting that despite 1960s predictions of dozens of nuclear states, there are currently only nine, a containment from five nuclear weapons states in 1968 to just four more [00:00:09]. This success, according to Rhodes, was partly a direct consequence of the Cuban Missile Crisis [00:00:40]. The intense correspondence between Kennedy and Khrushchev post-crisis quickly led to the decision for a treaty to prevent further proliferation [00:00:53].

## The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)

The [[the_role_of_the_Nuclear_Nonproliferation_Treaty_in_global_arms_control | Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty]] (NPT), tabled in 1968 and effective in 1970, was founded on a central "bargain" [00:01:00]:
*   Non-nuclear powers agreed not to develop nuclear weapons [00:01:09]. In return, they would receive support from major powers for peaceful uses of nuclear energy [00:01:11].
*   Nuclear powers promised to work towards universal nuclear disarmament [00:01:18].

> [!warning] Unfulfilled Bargain
> Richard Rhodes noted that the promise of nuclear disarmament by nuclear powers has "not been kept" [00:01:18]. This unfulfilled bargain has caused "non-nuclear signatories" to become "pretty restless" [00:01:26], nearly abrogating the treaty during its 1995 renewal [00:01:28].

### Australia's Early Hesitation with the NPT

Surprisingly, Australia, now a strong advocate for non-proliferation, initially refused to sign the NPT for two years under the Gorton government (1968-1970), making it the second-to-last country to sign before the treaty came into force [00:03:30]. This refusal stemmed from a desire to keep open the option of developing its own nuclear arsenal [00:03:50].

Sir Philip Baxter, then chairman of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and a former Manhattan Project scientist, heavily influenced Prime Minister John Gorton [00:05:00]. Baxter advocated for Australia to build a reactor at Jervis Bay to produce weapons-grade fissile material [00:05:47]. His view was that "white folk have a right to... develop the weapons that we need to keep the hordes away" [00:06:03]. The debate within Canberra's bureaucracy, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and the defense community, was "very severe" [00:06:27].

Ultimately, Australia joined the NPT but with reservations, using "weasel words" to imply a potential withdrawal in "extremis" [00:07:15]. Dean Rusk, the US Secretary of State at the time, expressed significant concern after meeting Gorton in 1968, noting Gorton's apprehension about giving up the nuclear option for 25 years and his doubt about US reliability in the event of nuclear blackmail [00:09:02]. The possibility of Australia developing nuclear weapons was "by no means small," with a "very, very strong" influence from Baxter and other bureaucratic sources [00:10:46].

## The 1995 NPT Extension and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)

The NPT had a 25-year lifespan, and its indefinite extension was negotiated over a four-week period at the Review and Extension Conference in New York in 1995 [00:11:17]. This was seen as the "only opportunity" for a permanent extension [00:11:41].

A key challenge was the non-nuclear weapon states' perception that nuclear weapon states had not upheld their disarmament bargain [00:14:01]. Richard Butler, Australia's Ambassador to the UN at the time, devised a solution: a separate, supplementary set of politically binding documents [00:17:09]. These documents prescribed "better behavior on the part of the nuclear weapon states," including a fissile materials cut-off treaty, reaffirmation of NPT Article VI commitments, and crucially, a commitment to a [[the_role_of_the_Nuclear_Nonproliferation_Treaty_in_global_arms_control | Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] (CTBT) by 1996 [00:17:21].

The political deal for the NPT's indefinite extension was sealed during a dinner hosted by Butler at his New York residence, with representatives from key groups including non-aligned nations and permanent Security Council members [00:21:51]. This late-night negotiation, lasting until 2 AM, resulted in an agreement adopted the next day [00:22:09].

### The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)

Banning nuclear testing is crucial for [[nuclear_nonproliferation_and_its_historical_context | nonproliferation]] because new nuclear weapons states need to test their devices to ensure they work [00:39:05].

The CTBT negotiations in Geneva were held hostage by India, which withheld its consensus due to a rule requiring unanimous agreement to send the treaty to the UN General Assembly [00:39:39]. Richard Butler bypassed this by drafting a resolution in Australia's name, identical to the Geneva text, and submitting it directly to the General Assembly [00:42:57]. This "Homeric trick" allowed the General Assembly to adopt the text overwhelmingly, leading to its opening for signature within a month [00:44:55].

> [!info] CTBT Status
> Although the CTBT has not yet formally entered into force due to stringent ratification requirements (needing 44 specified states) [01:10:59], it is largely "being acted upon as if it has" [01:12:21]. The treaty's international monitoring system, a "seismological system" complemented by overhead systems, can detect underground explosions and differentiate them from natural events like earthquakes, with data sent to Vienna for analysis [01:36:56].

## The Future of [[nuclear_proliferation_and_its_implications | Nuclear Proliferation]]

The NPT has been "absolutely fundamental" and is often called the "cornerstone of nuclear arms control" [02:26:24]. It established a norm that "no one should have nuclear weapons" [02:27:01]. All signatory countries have conformed to the treaty, not acquiring weapons or assisting others [02:28:12]. The nine nuclear states today include the five permanent UN Security Council members (US, Russia, UK, France, China) and four non-signatories to the NPT: India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea [02:28:25].

> *   **Argentina and Brazil** both "had embarked upon nuclear weapons programs" [00:33:03].
> *   **Israel** is widely believed to possess "some 200 nuclear explosive devices" but has never publicly conceded this or tested them [00:33:51].

### Risks of Future Proliferation

The future of [[nuclear_proliferation_and_its_implications | nuclear proliferation]] is uncertain. The rise of authoritarian or semi-fascistic governments could lead some states to disregard non-proliferation norms [02:17:01]. Countries like Japan, South Korea, Iran, or European nations (e.g., Germany, Baltic states) might consider developing nuclear weapons if they feel threatened [02:18:27]. Indonesia, with its increasingly militaristic government, has also shown past interest [02:20:27].

### [[challenges_related_to_extended_nuclear_deterrence_and_us_alliances | Extended Nuclear Deterrence]] and Australia's Position

The idea of [[challenges_related_to_extended_nuclear_deterrence_and_us_alliances | extended nuclear deterrence]], where a nuclear power protects an ally, is questioned. The reliability of the US to use nuclear weapons to defend Australia against a nuclear attack from China, for example, is doubted: "Only a fool would think so" [02:47:29].

Australia's increasing alignment with the United States, particularly through initiatives like AUKUS submarines, is seen by some as making Australia a "Lackey or colony of the United States" [02:23:13]. This risks undermining Australia's historical role as a neutral, independent middle power in multilateral diplomacy [02:23:38].

The decision regarding AUKUS and nuclear submarines is considered by some to be "the worst foreign policy and national security decision our country has ever taken" [02:46:39]. The presence and expansion of US joint facilities in Australia, including airfields capable of B-52 bombers, are seen as potentially contrary to Australia's obligations under the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) [02:47:51].

If Australia felt it could no longer rely on American [[challenges_related_to_extended_nuclear_deterrence_and_us_alliances | extended nuclear deterrence]] and other regional countries acquired nuclear forces, voices would argue for Australia to build its own [02:21:03]. However, this is not justified, as [[nuclear_deterrence | nuclear deterrence]] itself is largely "illusory" [02:21:48]. While Australia has abundant uranium reserves, building nuclear weapons would still take "years rather than months" [02:23:40].

## The Path Forward for Disarmament

Despite current concerns about a new nuclear arms race and disturbing rhetoric, there is ongoing awareness that [[nuclear_disarmament | nuclear disarmament]] is essential [02:09:50].

> [!quote] Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons (1996)
> The Canberra Commission, chaired by Richard Butler, articulated three fundamental axioms on nuclear weapons:
> 1.  "As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will one day be used by accident or design" [02:10:13].
> 2.  "Any use would be absolutely devastating to the whole world from which we would likely never recover" [02:10:17].
> 3.  "The only safe thing to do with nuclear weapons is to see them onto a museum shelf" [02:10:28].

The means to achieve [[nuclear_disarmament | nuclear disarmament]] are known, including treaties like the CTBT and a fissile material cut-off treaty [02:10:39]. It is "folly to believe that they could sit there and as long as we all did our good diplomacy and politics and so on that wouldn't someone wouldn't one day reach one take it off the shelf and use it" [02:15:40].

There appears to be a "general complacency" about [[nuclear_proliferation_and_its_implications | proliferation]] today, with nuclear weapon states seemingly "smug" about their "uniqueness" [02:24:15]. This may be due to other pressing global issues like climate change and food security [02:24:40].

For young people interested in pursuing careers to reduce the risk of nuclear war, advice includes:
*   Study nuclear science and technology [02:26:37].
*   Learn about international politics, particularly the multilateral aspect and treaty approaches [02:26:45].
*   Engage with international law and affairs [02:27:07].
*   Get a proper education in political science and international relations [02:27:49].
*   Learn a relevant foreign language [02:28:32].
*   Develop the skill of active listening to discern true intentions in negotiations [02:29:01].

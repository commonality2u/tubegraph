The concept of heritability is complex, especially when discussing its influence on human traits like intelligence and creativity. David Deutsch and Steven Pinker offer complementary but distinct perspectives on how genetic and environmental factors, alongside human creativity, shape behavior.

## Defining Heritability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>

David Deutsch highlights two common meanings of heritability:
*   The likelihood of an individual possessing similar traits to their parents and genetically related individuals, adhering to the rules of Mendelian genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>.
*   The extent to which a trait or behavior is directly controlled by genes, akin to how eye color is genetically determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>.

Steven Pinker clarifies that in the field of behavioral genetics, heritability is understood as a measure of individual differences within a specific sample of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>. It quantifies how much of the variation in a trait among individuals in that sample can be attributed to genetic differences between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>. It is not meaningful to discuss the heritability of a single person's intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>.

Heritability is typically measured through various methods:
*   **Twin Studies** Comparing identical twins (sharing all genes) with fraternal twins (sharing half their genes) raised in similar environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>. If identical twins are more similar, it suggests a genetic role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:17">[01:12:17]</a>.
*   **Adoption Studies** Examining twins separated at birth (sharing genes but not environment) or comparing adoptive siblings (sharing environment but not genes) with biological siblings (sharing both) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>.
*   **Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)** Analyzing patterns of variable genes and their statistical correlation with specific traits like intelligence or, hypothetically, creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>.

For almost every psychological trait that can be measured, heritability is found to be greater than zero, though always less than one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>. This means that genetic differences play a role, even if not fully determining a trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>.

## The Overlooked Role of Creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>

Deutsch argues that the traditional framing of behavior as solely controlled by genes or as a purely social construct misses the "main determinant of human behavior, which is [[the_interplay_between_innovation_trial_and_error_and_natural_selection | creativity]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>. Creativity, in this view, is something that doesn't always have a direct origin, although it can be influenced by upbringing, culture, or genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>.

He provides an example of a tennis player who, despite being shorter than average (Michael Chang was 5'9" while the average was 6'3"), became a great player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:37">[01:08:37]</a>. Deutsch suggests that this individual might have compensated for their genetic unsuitability by dedicating more of their creativity during childhood to developing their skills in tennis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>. This highlights that outcomes are not solely determined by inherent abilities but also by how individuals apply their creative problem-solving to overcome challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a>.

Deutsch further suggests that societal influences can also affect creativity, citing a historical school custom where boys who disliked an activity were forced to do it more. If effective, this could lead to individuals excelling in areas they were less genetically inclined to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>.

## Genes, Environment, and the Unique Individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>

Pinker acknowledges that heritability is a correlational statistic and doesn't directly imply that a trait is solely due to brain operation via genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:12">[01:17:12]</a>. Genetic influence can be indirect, mediated by appearance, personality traits, or cognitive styles that lead individuals to choose certain environments over others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. For instance, a smarter person might spend more time in libraries or school, effectively placing themselves in an environment that is "downstream from genetic differences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>. This phenomenon is known as "gene-environment correlation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:58">[01:17:58]</a>.

A surprising finding in behavioral genetics is that for some traits, like intelligence, heritability tends to increase with age, while the effects of shared family environment decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>. This counter-intuitive trend suggests that as people age, they have more opportunities to select environments that best utilize their heritable talents, leading to a greater predictability based on their genetic endowment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>. In contrast, children are often constrained by the environments chosen by their parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.

Despite these influences, identical twins reared together are never perfectly correlated in their traits (e.g., they correlate around 0.5 for many traits, not 1.0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34">[01:21:34]</a>. This indicates that a significant portion of individual differences is neither purely genetic nor attributable to easily measurable shared environmental factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>. Pinker suggests this "non-shared or unique environment" could be due to minute, infinitesimal differences or even random processes during brain development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>.

Deutsch attributes this remaining variance to [[Cultural evolution and its significance | creativity]], suggesting that it represents something unique to the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>. He emphasizes that if an environment were to entirely determine behavior, it would mean that creativity was being suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>. The argument is that while small differences in initial states or internal random processes can diverge through cognitive exploration, the ultimate explanation of an individual's unique path lies not in the microscopic substrate but in their choices and how they creatively navigate their problems and environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. Both thinkers agree that explanations of human behavior are best understood at the level of knowledge, thought, and cognition, rather than solely at the neurophysiological level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:16">[01:26:16]</a>.

The setting of [[central_banks_and_2_inflation_target | inflation targets]], such as the 2% target, can be compared to the initial determination of Basel Capital requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Initial Basel Capital Requirements

The Basel Capital requirements were initially set at 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This level was considered reasonable because it was "not too close to zero and not too high up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Arbitrary Nature of Target Setting

There is a perceived arbitrary nature in how important financial and economic numbers, like capital requirements or inflation targets, are chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Comparison to Inflation Targets

Similarly, the 2% inflation target is a level where some inflation is present but "nobody really cares about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Studies suggest that inflation typically becomes a problem in the double digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, leaving "a lot of room between two and and and double digits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

The primary concern with higher inflation is that it can "start getting a life of its own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Therefore, the goal is an inflation level low enough to avoid significant public concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This low level helps anchor expectations, ensuring that price movements are primarily relative rather than absolute. At higher inflation levels, relative price movements tend to become more generalized, leading to overall price increases, such as those caused by rising oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Importance of Consistency

Regardless of the specific number chosen for a target, its importance lies more in being "low and and you just hit them consistently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

[[challenges_of_changing_inflation_targets | Changing inflation targets]], for instance, from 2% to 4%, presents difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. If an economy is significantly above the target and decides to raise it, it can appear as an admission of defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Conversely, if inflation is at or below target, the challenge might be getting inflation *up*. The Federal Reserve (FED) faced this issue before the pandemic, with inflation around 1.2% over the preceding decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. While some suggested raising the target to 4%, the FED opted to change its framework to be more accommodating of inflation rather than raising the specific target, as it seemed "ridiculous" to change the goalpost if the current one couldn't be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The core principle remains that the chosen number should be "below the radar screen of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

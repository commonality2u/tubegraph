No American president since [[USChina economic and military dynamics | China's]] rise as a great power in the early post-Cold War years has declared the [[USChina economic and military dynamics | China challenge]] a national mission requiring the devotion of the entire country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This level of commitment would be necessary for the scale of the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Scope of the Challenge

[[USChina economic and military dynamics | China]]'s economy is well past 60% of American GDP, making the [[comparison_of_china_challenge_to_cold_war | China challenge]] economically much larger than the Cold War, Imperial Japan, or Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Addressing this requires a "whole of nation" effort, surpassing even the Cold War in scope, and cannot be undertaken quietly or as merely a "Beltway" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. It demands that the [[role_of_american_presidents_in_addressing_china | American president]] openly call upon the public to commit to this endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Disconnect Between "Beltway" and Popular Culture

The intellectual environment in the US does not suggest the nation is prepared for a contest of this magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The subject is not prominent in popular culture, with figures like Joe Rogan not displaying an obsession with [[USChina economic and military dynamics | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

While there is substantial intellectual output from American scholars, think tanks, political advisors, and military analysts writing books about [[USChina economic and military dynamics | China]], and journals like *Foreign Affairs* are replete with articles on the [[USChina economic and military dynamics | China Challenge]] and threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, this discourse largely remains within the "Beltway crowd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Broader cultural engagement from prominent commentators like David Brooks and Ross Douthat, through books on the [[USChina economic and military dynamics | China Challenge]], is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Historical Comparisons

This current intellectual climate does not resemble the Cold War, which saw the development of "Cold War liberalism" as an entire school of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. It also doesn't compare to the War on Terrorism, during which figures like Andrew Sullivan, Christopher Hitchens, Paul Berman, Michael Ignatieff, and *The New York Times* editorial page were preoccupied with questions of maintaining liberal democracy against the radical Islamist threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The current lack of intellectual ferment suggests insufficient public and intellectual support for the scale of the challenge that the governing class claims to be undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

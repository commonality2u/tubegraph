Initially, there was a belief that making [[impact_of_easy_credit_policies | credit]] easier, particularly for housing, would allow individuals to benefit from [[effects_of_housing_appreciation_on_wealth | house appreciation]] and increase their wealth and portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This approach was also thought to alleviate concerns like job insecurity or insufficient human capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Both political ideologies converged on the idea of expanding housing credit, aiming to create more property owners and make workers wealthier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

While expanding housing credit was seen as a good idea within limits, it ultimately became an unchecked movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The Illusion of Equity

When incomes were not growing, there was political pressure to find ways to keep people content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Expanding credit provided a means for people to consume more through debt or equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This created an illusion that individuals were not truly borrowing, but rather drawing down on existing equity as their home prices increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The term "draw down" sounded better than "borrowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Negative Consequences

However, providing too much [[impact_of_easy_credit_policies | credit]] too easily can lead to harm, even for those who receive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. People might acquire credit at an inopportune time when prices are rapidly rising, potentially leading to unaffordable housing or unsustainable consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

A significant issue arose when individuals drew down on their home equity lines, only to face a subsequent collapse in property prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This left them with no equity and often in deep debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The appreciation they were borrowing against became increasingly fragile, as it was based on a speculative bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

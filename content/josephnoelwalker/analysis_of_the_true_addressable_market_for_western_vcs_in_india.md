Venture capitalists (VCs) frequently [[overestimation_of_market_size_in_indian_startups | overestimate the size of the market]] in India, leading to misunderstandings about the true addressable market for investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## India's Unique Digital Revolution

Unlike developed nations where digital transformation followed significant GDP per capita growth and widespread affordability of devices and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, [[indias_digital_revolution_contrast_with_developed_countries | India's digital revolution]] has occurred in an "upside down" manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. For instance, some of the poorest regions in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar possess excellent internet connectivity, despite lacking basic amenities like water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Misconceptions Regarding Digital Access and Disposable Income

A common misconception arises from statistics indicating that 860 million people in India are connected to the digital space via smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This leads to projections like an edtech company having a potential market of 300 million users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. However, this is considered a "huge overestimation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The actual number of people in India with internet access comparable to the US, specifically those with similar [[discrepancy_between_digital_access_and_disposable_income_in_india | disposable income]], is only about 25 to 30 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This segment represents the consumers who typically subscribe to services like Netflix or Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## The "Indus Valley Report" Perspective

Sajith Pai's recent "Indus Valley Report" offers a more accurate assessment of the addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The report estimates that the true market, referred to as "India A," is roughly the size of Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The group that engages in significant online spending is estimated to be around 200 million people, possibly even less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The remaining "next billion" people do not spend substantial amounts of money on digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Despite this, VCs often seek to replicate successful Western models like DoorDash or Uber for the Indian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. They incorrectly equate California's population of millions with India's 860 million smartphone users as a one-to-one translation for total addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. In reality, these investments target "the Taiwan that lives in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, a market segment smaller and poorer than California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This represents a significant misjudgment for Western VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

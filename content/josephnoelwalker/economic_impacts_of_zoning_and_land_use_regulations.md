Brian Kaplan's book, *Build Baby Build: The Science and Ethics of Housing Regulation*, examines the [[economic_impacts_of_zoning_and_land_use_regulations | economic and social consequences]] of housing regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. His overarching idea is that "the world is wrong because human beings are wrong," often discarding common sense due to emotions, leading to flawed actions based on false assumptions about the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Many of his books explore how people make mistakes that result in negative outcomes, such as the current state of [[zoning_regulations_and_their_impact_on_housing_supply | housing regulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Concrete Impacts of Housing Deregulation

Full [[housing_deregulation | housing deregulation]] would significantly alter the American landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Cities:** Downtowns, currently the most regulated areas, would likely see the most gains in percentage terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. It would become easier to build skyscrapers, which are currently restricted in cities like San Francisco, often compounded by strict historic site regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Suburbs:** Deregulation would make it easier to construct multi-family housing, as approximately 80% of residential land is currently reserved for single-family homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This would allow more people to live in apartments in suburban areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Single-Family Homes:** Even for single-family homes, regulations often mandate the "waste" of significant land through minimum lot size requirements, sometimes as large as two or five acres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Deregulation would allow for more efficient land use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Overall, deregulation would likely lead to more urbanized areas, but also more "leg room" for everyone due to increased construction across all locations, making housing more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. For instance, living in Manhattan could mean a spacious, affordable apartment rather than a tiny, expensive one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Measuring the Regulatory Burden

The impact of [[zoning_regulations_and_their_impact_on_housing_supply | zoning regulations]] on house prices is often measured using an approach pioneered by Joe Gyourko and Edward Glaeser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Methodology:** This method seeks to compare similar homes where some have more undeveloped land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. By observing how much people value "pure land" (land that cannot be built on), it's found that its marginal value is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This highlights the inefficiency of minimum lot size regulations, as they force buyers to acquire land they don't value highly, preventing additional housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **"Zoning Tax":** Gyourko and Glaeser then use construction cost manuals to estimate the physical cost of a property and compare it to market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The difference is attributed to regulation, metaphorically termed the "zoning tax" or regulatory burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This residual method is used because of the sheer number and variability of regulations across areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Critiques and Refinements:** A critique suggests that marginal land is valued little due to indivisibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. While this can be true in specific cases, it doesn't apply to regulations forcing larger plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Developers typically build to the legal limit, indicating a low appreciation for excess land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Later work by Gyourko using prices of vacant lots largely addresses this critique, yielding similar results and supporting the method's soundness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## Productivity and Migration

### Regional Productivity Disparities and Mobility
The US exhibits significant [[regional_productivity_disparities_in_the_us | regional productivity disparities]], yet internal mobility has decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. Traditionally, people moved from low-wage, backward areas to advanced, high-wage areas for better pay and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. This was common from the 1940s to 1970s, with large populations moving to California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.

However, studies show that while high-skilled individuals still move to high-productivity areas, lower-skilled workers are moving in reverse, from high-wage places like San Francisco to lower-wage places like Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. This counterintuitive trend is due to the enormous [[economic_and_social_consequences_of_unaffordable_housing | housing costs]] in high-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. The percentage wage gain in expensive cities no longer exceeds the extra housing cost for low-skilled workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.

### The Agglomeration Effect and its Challenges
[[productivity_gains_from_urbanization | Productivity gains from urbanization]], or agglomeration, are based on the idea that concentrating talented individuals in close proximity fosters innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>.
*   **Talent Dilution Critique:** A common critique is that if [[housing deregulation]] leads to mass migration to productive centers like the Bay Area, the influx of less-talented individuals would dilute the unique "weirdness" or innovativeness of the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>. However, many jobs in these areas are low-skilled (e.g., janitors), and the idea that adding more low-skilled workers would hinder the innovation of high-skilled workers is puzzling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. The opposite is more likely: increased density, even with more low-skilled workers, could increase the total number of innovators by allowing currently isolated innovators to move to the absolute center of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.
*   **Economies of Scale and Prices:** Another challenge is whether enabling more building in major cities intensifies economies of scale, leading to higher productivity and incomes, which would ultimately translate into *higher* rents and prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. While agglomeration effects can immediately lead to higher rents, it is "totally possible to just keep building more buildings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. The constraint is not the ability to construct, but the scarce supply of human talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. Therefore, the ability to build is "almost unlimited," which should eventually lead to more affordable housing, despite the draw of high-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>.
*   **Historical Context of Innovation:** Small cities like Periclean Athens (215,000-300,000 people) and Renaissance Florence (50,000-95,000 people) produced astonishing efflorescences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>. This can be explained by the "low-hanging fruit" theory: early on, valuable ideas were not as difficult to discover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>. As knowledge advances, reaching the research frontier becomes increasingly challenging, requiring more minds and resources to achieve the same level of innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:52">[01:04:52]</a>. Thus, in the modern era, larger agglomeration effects are needed to sustain productivity growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>.

## Broader Economic Impacts

### Immigration and Housing
The [[relationship_between_immigration_and_housing | relationship between immigration and housing]] is becoming increasingly linked, with some arguing that high [[economic_benefits_of_immigration | immigration]] demand makes housing unaffordable without deregulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. In the US, many regulations are local, leading to significant variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. States like Texas, with lighter regulation, experience massive population increases because people can move there affordably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

The core argument for [[economic_benefits_of_immigration | immigration]] is that it allows workers to move from low-productivity countries to high-productivity ones, dramatically increasing their earnings and global productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. For example, a shoe shiner from Haiti moving to Miami becomes more productive by saving customers more valuable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. While it might seem that low-skilled [[economic_benefits_of_immigration | immigration]] would depress wages for domestic low-skilled workers, evidence suggests these effects are small at best, and sometimes even positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. Low-skilled immigrants often have different skills, allowing native low-skilled workers to specialize in jobs requiring language skills (e.g., supervisors), leading to promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

### Fertility Rates
There is an argument that [[economic_and_social_consequences_of_unaffordable_housing | housing unaffordability]] contributes to declining fertility rates, as it makes it harder for people to afford larger living spaces or leave their parents' homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. While some research points to an association between density and reduced fertility (e.g., Tokyo, Seoul), these studies often fail to disentangle the effects of density from high prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>.

Deregulation that leads to cheaper suburban housing, for instance, would likely increase fertility because it provides more space and makes it easier for young adults to move out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. The ability to live independently at an earlier age is correlated with higher fertility in European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>. Housing is one sector where progress has stalled, making it difficult for younger generations to replicate their parents' living standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>.

## The Political Economy of Regulation

### Supply Skepticism and NIMBYism
A significant barrier to [[housing deregulation | deregulation]] is "supply skepticism," where a substantial percentage of Americans believe that increasing housing supply will cause prices to *rise* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>. This phenomenon is also observed in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:34">[01:20:34]</a>.

Instead of self-interest, political scientists suggest that people's views on policy are rarely driven by objective material self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:22">[01:21:22]</a>. For example, homeowners and tenants often show similar levels of resistance to deregulation, despite their differing financial stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>. People typically oppose new construction not out of fear of personal financial harm, but from a general belief that it would be "bad for human beings" or society at large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a>. This often stems from a philosophical opposition to development ("building bad") and a resistance to change (status quo bias) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:15">[01:23:15]</a>. Local objections often include concerns about traffic, parking, blocked views, and shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>.

### Political Pathways for Deregulation
While local resistance ("NIMBYism") is strong, some YIMBY (Yes In My Backyard) movements are gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:02">[01:27:02]</a>.
*   **State-Level Action:** Most significant YIMBY initiatives have occurred at the state level, where governments in California, Oregon, and Minnesota have pressured or mandated local governments to deregulate, sometimes even officially ending single-family zoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>. State governments possess inherent power over localities and can invalidate local rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:20">[01:37:20]</a>.
*   **Federal Intervention:** Federal intervention is less common, but some argue it could be marketed as a way to "screw over blue states by helping them" (through deregulation), appealing to certain political factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>. This taps into the idea that politics often involves "joy plus anger"—the joy of victory combined with anger against perceived enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>.
*   **Challenges:** The "YIMBY" movement is currently somewhat bipartisan, with vocal activists tending to be left-wing in blue cities, while red states often have lighter regulations by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:18">[01:32:18]</a>. The movement might become "left-coded" due to the visibility of its activists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>. Public perception often prefers government-built housing (public housing) over private sector deregulation, even though public housing provides less than 1% of all housing in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>.
*   **Judicial Overturns:** Overturning zoning laws through the Supreme Court is extremely unlikely, as the 1926 *Euclid v. Ambler Realty* decision broadly permitted local governments to consider almost anything a "nuisance" that could be regulated without compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:23">[01:38:23]</a>. Even if overturned, local and state resistance through legal delays could effectively nullify the ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:03">[01:40:03]</a>.

## Long-Term Outlook

In the very long run, human history might tend towards a densely populated planet, resembling Coruscant from *Star Wars* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:33">[01:42:33]</a>. This is partly due to the eventual rise in pronatal attitudes through evolutionary selection, leading to continued population growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:02">[01:43:02]</a>. Maximizing human population on Earth, potentially through technologies like draining oceans for more land, is more feasible in the short to medium term (thousands of years) than interstellar colonization, which faces immense cost and technological bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:09">[01:45:09]</a>.

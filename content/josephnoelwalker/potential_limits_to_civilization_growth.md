The concept of potential physical limits to civilization growth has been explored by thinkers such as W. MacAskill and Holden Karnofsky. They suggest that if humanity continues its current rate of approximately 2% economic growth per year, within about 10,000 years, the output per atom would need to become implausible to sustain that growth rate, implying a physical constraint on expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:22">[01:46:22]</a>.

## Arguments Against Physical Limits

Physicist David Deutsch argues that such concerns are based on "ridiculous extrapolations" of current theories into the far future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:45">[01:47:45]</a>. He offers several counter-arguments:

*   **"Plenty of Room at the Bottom"**: Deutsch suggests that growth might continue by utilizing smaller scales of matter. Just as there was ample room at the bottom of the atomic scale, future computations could potentially be made using quarks, or even newly created quarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:53">[01:47:53]</a>.
*   **Energy Efficiency**: There is currently no known lower limit to the energy required to perform a given computation. While future computation might require extreme refrigeration, the potential for increasing efficiency without limit suggests that energy availability might not be a barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:14">[01:48:14]</a>.
*   **Quantum Gravity Domain**: Beyond the quark scale, the quantum gravity domain exists, which is many orders of magnitude smaller. Deutsch speculates that there could be an "infinite amount of space at the bottom" within this unknown realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:36">[01:48:36]</a>.
*   **Evolving Theories**: Current theories of cosmology are rapidly changing, often on a time scale of a decade. Extrapolating current scientific understanding 10,000 years into the future to draw pessimistic conclusions is deemed absurd, as the science of that future time is unknowable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:07">[01:49:07]</a>.

Steven Pinker supports Deutsch's optimistic view, emphasizing that human growth primarily thrives on [[Challenges and opportunities in technological development | information]] and [[The value of life and existential risk | knowledge]], not just raw material or "stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:43">[01:49:43]</a>.

*   **Information-Based Growth**: Growth can manifest as "better and better information," more entertaining virtual experiences, remarkable discoveries, or new ways of encountering the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>.
*   **Decoupling from Physical Resources**: These forms of growth do not necessarily require increasing amounts of energy or material. They often involve rearranging pixels and bits, or faster searches in the space of possibilities (e.g., for disease cures), which can thrive on information that is not physically limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:06">[01:50:06]</a>.
*   **Efficiency in Information**: Long-term growth in information might involve replacing existing information with more efficient forms, rather than continuously adding to overall storage or energy consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:46">[01:50:46]</a>.

Ultimately, both optimists conclude that present scientific knowledge is insufficient to predict or justify pessimistic conclusions about long-term [[Potential solutions to global existential risks | civilization growth]] based on purported physical limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:12">[01:51:12]</a>. They suggest that [[Philosophical implications of longevity | progress]] is a reasonable expectation based on rational analysis of history and the nature of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:56">[01:51:56]</a>.

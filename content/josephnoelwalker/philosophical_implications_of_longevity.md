The discussion on the philosophical implications of longevity explores questions of [[transhumanism_and_personal_identity | personal identity]], the societal impact of extended lifespans, and the underlying motivations for pursuing [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | life extension]] technologies.

## Personal Identity and Longevity

The conversation dives into the philosophical concept of [[transhumanism_and_personal_identity | personal identity]], particularly in the context of extended lifespans and [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | cryopreservation]].

The host introduces Derek Parfit's "bundle theory," which posits that each person is a shifting web of experiences rather than a singular ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Laura Deming states that a central question in the next century of [[transhumanism_and_personal_identity | transhumanism]] is "what do you want to preserve over time?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. She emphasizes that there's no single "right answer" from either Eastern or Western philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

While arguments for physical continuity can be constructed, they differ from the innate drive to survive. This intuitive need for survival can be a subjective choice to hold onto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Influence on Capital Allocation

Deming suggests that these philosophical debates are already subconsciously influencing how capital is allocated in the field of [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | life extension]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. People's unexamined beliefs about [[transhumanism_and_personal_identity | personal identity]] guide their intuitions about which technologies are worth investing in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

In Silicon Valley, the prevailing view favors preserving the physical self with the most conservative perspective on self-preservation, aiming for physical continuity for as long as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. However, deeper contemplation, similar to Buddhist "no self" meditation, often leads individuals to question the defendability of this strict physical continuity, moving closer to Parfit's view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Despite this, people still find reasons to keep their bodies healthy and alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Evolution of Perspective

Laura Deming reflects on her personal journey regarding longevity:
> "I grew up with that as a really core part of my identity. I was like, my job is to fix this problem. No one else is work or almost no one else is working on it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>

She now understands the "argument for the opposite of longevity" – that avoiding "extreme mental anguish" from grappling with horrific and inevitable truths in life can be a valid and wise choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Despite this, she maintains that *not* working on longevity drugs is "incorrect" because they are fundamentally a type of medicine, no different from exercise or other health-promoting interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

This shift in perspective involves understanding that some people might feel equally happy if conscious entities similar to themselves continue to exist, rather than strictly *they* themselves persisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. This relates to the "teleporter thought experiment," where a copy of a person is created at a distant location while the original is destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. People's willingness to use such a teleporter reveals what they prioritize preserving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

Even with this broader view, Deming argues that longevity can still be valuable because it allows conscious entities a very long time to evolve, leading to unique forms of beauty and experience that would be impossible with shortened lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Humane Transhumanism

Deming discusses her search for a "more humane [[transhumanism_and_personal_identity | transhumanism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. She finds many existing transhumanist manifestos to be incomplete, often focused excessively on "gaining power" and the "drive to survive," lacking elements like "love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

She also critiques its overconfidence in predicting future technologies and societal changes, finding it more interesting to observe how populations change in unpredictable ways rather than how individuals change predictably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This suggests a shift from an individual-centric view to a population-level analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

She finds inspiration for a humane [[transhumanism_and_personal_identity | transhumanist]] vision in Rainer Maria Rilke's *Duino Elegies*, which, despite their complexity, speak to an individual's struggle to connect with a dimly perceived, higher level of understanding or experience, using "angels" as a metaphor for something beyond human comprehension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This aligns with the idea of [[transhumanism_and_personal_identity | transcendence]] – becoming something one doesn't yet fully understand, like a 2D object trying to conceive of a 3D object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

While acknowledging the value of stories like Mark Stigler's "The Gentle Seduction" for their focus on human experience, Deming notes they often "avoid the whole question of how strange the change actually will be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

## Sociopolitical Implications of Extended Lifespans

If average human lifespans extended to, say, 150-200 years, several non-obvious societal changes could occur:

*   **Cultural Evolution and Mastery**: Longer lifespans could foster deeper mastery and new forms of creative output, similar to the painter of "The Great Wave off Kanagawa" who felt he was only just beginning to learn how to draw at 60 or 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. This extended period of "evolution" for conscious entities could lead to unprecedented beauty and originality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.
*   **Game Theory and Cooperation**: In game theory, playing an unknown, very long number of rounds incentivizes cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. If individuals have significantly more time in society, they might become more pro-social, although this is a speculative area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.
*   **Economic Inequality**: A significant negative implication is the potential for increased inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>. If early generations with extended lifespans accumulate and compound capital over much longer periods, "being born way earlier" could become a new form of inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. This might necessitate new societal structures, such as wealth taxation over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.
*   **Scientific Productivity**: Extended healthy lifespans for scientists like Einstein could lead to prolonged periods of productivity, assuming they maintain vigor and mental plasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. However, this also links back to the [[transhumanism_and_personal_identity | personal identity]] question: whether individuals would retain the same creative spark or be open to identity changes necessary for continued relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.
*   **Societal Dynamism and Generational Effects**: Francis Fukuyama's concern about extended lifespans leading to a less dynamic society due to persistent, generationally inflected worldviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a> is acknowledged. Older generations retaining positions of power could reduce "turnover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. However, Deming believes society already adapts, citing musical trends where new styles replace older ones as culture shifts, regardless of artists' longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.

## Scientific Awe and Its Role

Laura Deming emphasizes the importance of the emotions of joy and awe in science and discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. She hopes that the ability to feel scientific awe can be trained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.

### Cultivating Awe
She has extensively thought about and cultivated this state of "intense awe and absorption" since 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. She describes personal practices like being in a "grassy open environment," listening to music, having recently eaten sugar, and engaging with developed mental objects, such as cell biology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>. She mentions that some of Einstein's early education involved visceral, intuitive approaches to mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

For Deming, scientific awe is the emotion she optimizes for in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. She values it for its intrinsic, hedonistic pleasure rather than purely functional reasons, describing it as feeling connected to the "laws of the universe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. She compares it to intense religious experiences but triggered by scientific understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.

### Embodied Thinking
A key method for triggering this state is "embodied thinking," such as imagining being inside a cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>. This requires a robust understanding of scientific laws to "render a world that has some like maybe that has enough" complexity and interactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>. The "powers of 10" exercise, mentally expanding or contracting scales from one's arm to an atom, allows exploration of different scales of reality while keeping the "whole world" accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

This mode of thinking has provided her with counterfactual scientific insights. For example, it helped her understand [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | cryopreservation]] by revealing that cells operate on passive diffusion and are remarkably invariant to thermal noise, which is very different from human-designed systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>. Biology and physics seem particularly amenable to this embodied mode of thinking, while mathematics feels more foreign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

## Scientific Mentorship

Deming highlights the profound impact of her mentor, Cynthia Kenyon, who took her seriously as an intellectual at age 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>. Kenyon's bravery in believing in ideas before others and her willingness to support unconventional individuals fostered Deming's self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>.

Deming expresses a desire for mentorship that would have affirmed her creativity, loving nature, and intuition at a younger age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>, believing that the Silicon Valley environment can "quash a lot of originality" by pushing young individuals to overfit to specific patterns of competence and confidence, especially when fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.

When mentoring, Deming focuses on seeing "the beauty" in someone and considering how external actions can help that beauty grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. She is drawn to individuals who exhibit authenticity and deep care and love for ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.

## Advancing Longevity Science

### Serendipity and Drug Development
The conversation touches on the challenge of serendipity in drug development, noting that historically many drugs have found uses different from their original design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. For [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | longevity]] drugs, demonstrating long-term benefits is particularly challenging. Deming states that there is currently no good way around running "very large, very difficult, and many cases very expensive trials" to demonstrate [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | lifespan extension]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>. While biomarkers might offer proxies in the future, they are not yet sufficient to imply longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>.

### Theories of Aging
The nature of aging itself is discussed. Deming finds it "extremely strange but true" that single gene changes in organisms can dramatically alter lifespan, sometimes by insane multiples in very small organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>. While the default assumption is that aging is a system breaking down randomly over time, the existence of a "non-zero component" that can be controlled, especially in non-human organisms (e.g., up to 6-fold lifespan extension in *C. elegans*, 60% in mice), suggests a programmed or quasi-programmed aspect to aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. The complexity of biological systems makes such simple changes having profound effects highly surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

### Regulatory Bottlenecks
To reduce regulatory bottlenecks for [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | longevity]] drugs, Deming suggests laying the groundwork for aging as a recognized medical indication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>. Most importantly, she would aim to significantly shorten review cycles for pre-clinical companies from six months to ideally a couple of weeks, reducing timeline uncertainty and accelerating iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.

### Investment Patterns
Through her experience with the [[communicating_and_investing_in_longevity_science | Longevity Fund]], Deming observed that the most successful companies in their portfolio were founder-oriented and pursued "moonshot ideas," often interacting with the fund from early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. Initial investments focused on conservative biotech companies with subtle links to aging to gain field acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.

## Cryopreservation as a Core Focus

Laura Deming describes [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | cryopreservation]] as "so obvious" a problem to work on, comparing it to a mathematician finding the perfect problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:32">[01:09:32]</a>.

### Why Cryopreservation?
She chose [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | cryopreservation]] because it meets several criteria she values:
*   **High Impact**: Reversible [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | cryopreservation]] (medical hibernation) could act as a "one-way time machine," bridging patients with terminal illnesses to future therapies that might be only years away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:43">[01:10:43]</a>. It's highly leveraged, as solving this one problem provides access to many other future medical advances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>.
*   **Technical Tractability**: While experimental, it allows for a deep interface with physics and engineering, enabling rapid development of new solutions and utilizing the full spectrum of physical ideas to attack the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. It is "more fully defined" as a problem compared to broader longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.
*   **Underworked On**: Compared to its potential, [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | cryopreservation]] is significantly underworked on, largely because it's perceived as "too weird" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>. It has a "force field" of "baggage" around it that deters many, but once understood, its beauty and impact become clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. The natural human aversion to "cold" also contributes to this intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>.

In the context of aging interventions (restoring, replacing, delaying, pausing), [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | cryopreservation]] falls into the "pausing" category, which Deming believes is inherently more tractable as a single problem due to its defined nature and amenability to physics and engineering tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>.

### Communication Challenges
Public communication about [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | cryopreservation]] is particularly difficult due to its "anti-mimetic" nature and counter-intuitive aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>. There are strategic reasons some aspects cannot be publicly discussed yet, as their very effectiveness lies in their obscurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>.

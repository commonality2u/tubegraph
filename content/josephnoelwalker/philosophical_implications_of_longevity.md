From: [[josephnoelwalker]] <br/> 

The philosophical implications of [[longevity_and_the_future_of_human_society | longevity]] delve into fundamental questions of identity, value, and societal structure. Discussions on these topics often begin with considerations of personal identity, particularly challenging traditional views of a continuous "ego" or "self" over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Personal Identity

Inspired by Derek Parfit's bundle theory, which posits that each individual is a "web of experiences shifting through time," the central question becomes: "What do you want to preserve over time?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This question is considered "very subjective" and one for which neither Eastern nor Western [[role_of_philosophy_in_understanding_modern_issues | philosophy]] offers a definitive answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Arguments for physical continuity can be reconstructed, but they differ significantly from an intuitive biological drive to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This intuitive need to survive is difficult to defend philosophically unless chosen as an arbitrary point to hold onto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The prevailing view in Silicon Valley, particularly among those investing in [[longevity_and_the_future_of_human_society | longevity]], tends to favor the "most conservative possible perspective" of preserving one's physical self with continuity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. However, deep contemplation on this matter, similar to "no-self meditation" in Buddhism, often leads to the conclusion that a strict defense of continuous self is hard to maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### The Teleporter Experiment

The "teleporter experiment" is a thought experiment that highlights these identity questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. In this scenario, a teleporter to Mars creates a copy of you on Mars while destroying the original on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Whether one would use such a teleporter reveals what one values most: whether it's the specific physical continuity of the self or the persistence of one's values, ideas, or even the existence of people similar to oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Even if one accepts a non-ego view of identity, there are still reasons to advocate for [[longevity_and_the_future_of_human_society | longevity]]. Extended lifespans allow conscious entities "a very long time to evolve," potentially leading to "a lot of beauty" and different forms of conscious experience that would not be possible with shorter lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Sociopolitical Implications

The [[role_of_philosophy_in_understanding_modern_issues | philosophical]] debates surrounding [[longevity_and_the_future_of_human_society | longevity]] are already influencing capital allocation today, albeit subconsciously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. People's unexamined beliefs about these topics guide investment intuitions, which in turn determine what technologies become available in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Redefining Transhumanism

The concept of [[transhumanism_and_its_sociopolitical_impact | transhumanism]] is debated, with a call for a "more humane" version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Traditional [[transhumanism_and_its_sociopolitical_impact | transhumanist]] manifestos are often criticized for focusing too much on "gaining power" and "this drive to survive," feeling incomplete and lacking a focus on "love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Furthermore, they are seen as "way too confident" in predicting future technological changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. A more "humane" [[transhumanism_and_its_sociopolitical_impact | transhumanism]] would focus on how populations change in unpredictable ways, rather than individuals changing predictably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. It should also be more concerned with the feelings of people during such changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

The challenge of envisioning truly novel futures is akin to sci-fi authors struggling to create relatable narratives beyond a certain degree of "strangeness," because human readers need characters they can relate to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. The core of [[transhumanism_and_its_sociopolitical_impact | transhumanism]] is about becoming something currently incomprehensible, like a 2D object attempting to become a 3D object without being able to conceive of the 3D form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

### Societal Change with Extended Lifespans

If average human lifespans and health spans were to extend to 150-200 years, significant, non-obvious societal changes could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

*   **Potential for Deeper Accomplishments:** Individuals with extended healthy lives could achieve unprecedented levels of mastery and creation. For example, the painter of "The Great Wave off Kanagawa," Hokusai, felt at 60 or 70 that he had only just begun to learn how to draw, wishing to reach 100 to truly draw things alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. This highlights the potential for "evolution over a long period of time of conscious entity" leading to unique and profound outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. It's crucial that these extended lives are also vigorous and plastic, maintaining creativity and freshness, rather than just extending decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

*   **Game Theory and Cooperation:** In game theory, repeated interactions where players don't know the end point incentivize cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. With unknown, very long lifespans, individuals in society might be incentivized to become more pro-social <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

*   **Risk of Increased Inequality:** A significant concern is that the first generation to live very long lives could gain "insane advantage" by being born earlier, allowing them to compound capital over much longer periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. Youth would cease to be an advantage, replaced by the advantage of historical birth timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. While innovation might mitigate this to some extent, it suggests a need for different societal structures, such as wealth taxation over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

*   **Generational Stagnation:** Francis Fukuyama raises the concern that extended lifespans could lead to a less dynamic society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. Worldviews are shaped by formative youth experiences, creating generational effects that drive social and political change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>. If individuals live much longer but retain these generationally inflected worldviews, it could lead to less turnover in positions of power and a less dynamic society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. However, it's argued that even today, cultural shifts (e.g., in music) demonstrate that ideas and styles are replaced regardless of individuals' longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

Ultimately, the core question remains: "What do you want to preserve over time?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a> The possibility of changing aspects of one's identity, guided by certain principles, is key to the potential for continued relevance and creativity in extended lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

## Accepting Mortality vs. Pursuing Longevity

There is a valid piece of wisdom in not wanting to think about the problem of [[longevity_and_the_future_of_human_society | longevity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Grappling with metaphysical questions or the horror of certain inevitabilities can cause "extreme mental anguish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. While pursuing [[longevity_and_the_future_of_human_society | longevity]] drugs is seen as factually correct and akin to any other medicine or exercise for health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, there's a deep wisdom in respecting individuals' metaphysical comfort when contemplating such topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. A good life might involve accepting certain things, and pushing against that acceptance can lead to suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Cryopreservation as a Bridge Technology

[[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | Cryopreservation]] is viewed as a highly impactful and tractable problem for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>:
*   **Impact:** Reversible [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]] could act as a "one-way time machine" to bridge the gap to future therapies for terminal illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. This allows individuals facing life-threatening conditions to wait for medical advancements, potentially extending their lifespan to a normal range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>.
*   **Leverage:** Solving this single problem completely grants access to "all these other things in the future," making it highly leveraged in terms of medical potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>.
*   **Tractability:** Unlike many biological problems, [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]] allows for deep integration of engineering and physics, offering significant leverage for solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. The fact that cells function via passive diffusion (random molecular motion) helps explain why [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]] is even possible, as cells are robust to such randomization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.
*   **Underworked Field:** Despite its potential, [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]] is "not worked on" significantly, largely because it's considered "too weird" and carries a lot of "baggage" that creates a "force field" around it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This includes intuitive aversion to the idea of "freezing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:06">[01:16:06]</a>. This anti-mimetic nature means certain powerful reasons for its neglect cannot be publicly discussed without undermining the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.

Within the broader categories of aging interventions (restoring, replacing, delaying, pausing), [[cryopreservation_and_its_potential_for_human_lifespan_extension | cryopreservation]] (pausing) is considered more straightforward and fully defined as a single problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:44">[01:13:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>.

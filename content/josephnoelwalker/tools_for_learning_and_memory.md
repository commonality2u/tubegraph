The process of learning and memory is explored through the unique, intensive preparation methods employed for podcast interviews, heavily influenced by applied researcher Andy Matuschak, who focuses on tools for thought [00:00:15]. This approach is described as an "extremely unusual" way of learning, akin to being an "athlete of learning" [00:00:41]. The core of this method involves dedicated study, strategic use of various tools, and continuous self-assessment to achieve deep understanding for complex discussions [00:00:54].

## The Preparation Process: Scale and Phases

Preparing for a single interview, such as the one with TB, can involve over 200 hours of focused learning [00:01:10, 00:03:10]. This extensive preparation is divided into "non-intensive" and "intensive" phases [00:01:44].

### Non-Intensive Preparation
This phase involves foundational learning and can span months or even years:
*   **Structured Study with Tutors:** For the TB interview, two months were spent with a private tutor, working through textbooks like "Bliston and Hang introduction to probability textbook" and "WAM and all of Statistics textbook" [00:01:18]. This included approximately 5 hours every Saturday for eight sessions, totaling around 40 hours [00:02:10].
*   **Formal Courses:** Completion of the "Real World Risk Institute course" took about 50 hours (5 hours nightly for two weeks) [00:01:31].
*   **Long-Term Engagement:** In some cases, preparation has been ongoing for "the last 8 years" by reading the guest's work [00:02:20].
*   **Syllabus Consulting:** When needing to master a field prerequisite to a guest's work, the interviewer consults professors and experts to get advice on a syllabus [00:05:08]. This involves asking for essential topics, important chapters, and areas that can be omitted given time constraints [00:07:07, 00:07:17].

### Intensive Preparation
This phase occurs closer to the interview, typically one to three weeks prior [00:02:28]:
*   **High-Volume Reading:** 8 to 14 hours per day are dedicated to reading the guest's material and relevant related works [00:02:30].
*   **Active Recall:** Daily "memory prompts" are used every morning to review material from previous days [00:02:41].
*   **Total Hours:** For the TB interview, this intensive phase alone accounted for about 100 hours of work over nine days [00:02:59, 00:03:02].

## Tools and Techniques for Learning

### Tutoring and Problem Solving
*   **Collaborative Learning:** With a private tutor (e.g., Tom), the process is often a peer relationship where both read textbooks independently and then come together to solve practice problems on a whiteboard, sometimes jointly, sometimes individually before comparing notes [00:08:10, 00:08:33, 00:08:53].
*   **Prerequisite Chaining:** When encountering difficult material, there's a quick identification of missing foundational knowledge, leading to "prerequisite chaining" to fill those gaps, often with the tutor providing mini-lessons on the spot [00:10:09, 00:10:21, 00:10:32].
*   **Multi-Level Tutoring:** For the TB interview, two tutors were used: one for advanced topics (Tom) and another (the interviewer's aunt, a high school math teacher) for rebuilding foundational math concepts [00:11:40, 00:11:51].

### Information Gathering and Processing
*   **Just-In-Time Learning:** When encountering unfamiliar concepts (e.g., options trading, futures trading) within a guest's work, [[challenges_of_mastering_new_fields_quickly | just-in-time learning]] is employed [01:00:50, 01:18:40].
    *   **LLMs and Search Engines:** Google and large language models (LLMs) like AI Drive (preferred for PDF uploads, folder organization, and model selection, including Gemini Pro) are used for quick definitions and concept clarification [01:13:01, 01:13:12, 01:32:51].
    *   **Expert Consultation:** Friends and experts are messaged for help when a concept is still unclear after self-research, or if the question itself feels "ill-posed" [01:13:17, 01:13:34].
*   **Taste and Prioritization:** Building a reading list involves a subjective "taste" for what topics are most important, difficult, or offer unique value, and this list constantly evolves during the intensive research sprint as more context is gained [01:14:34, 01:15:01, 01:15:10, 01:16:16].

### Reading and Note-Taking
*   **Physical Books with Book Tags:** Reading is primarily done with physical books, using "book tags" (Post-it notes) to mark sections for later conversion into memory prompts or for extraction [01:32:31, 01:36:55]. This allows for uninterrupted reading flow [01:41:19].
*   **Digital Copies:** A digital PDF version of the book is often open simultaneously in an LLM wrapper like AI Drive for immediate clarification or explanation of complex sections [01:32:37, 01:32:41].
*   **Live Comprehension Checks:** As material is read, understanding is constantly monitored. If a concept is important and unclear, it's looked up immediately to avoid hindering understanding of subsequent material [01:37:27].
*   **Obsidian Notes:**
    *   **Wishlist Notes:** Long-standing guests have "wishlist" notes (e.g., "TB questions") that accumulate thoughts, vague ideas for questions, links to interviews, and critiques over years [01:16:55, 01:17:39]. These notes are consulted every other day during intensive prep, allowing for serendipitous discovery of relevant points [01:19:48, 01:20:09].
    *   **Per-Book/Chapter Notes:** Obsidian is also used for specific notes on each book or chapter. These include:
        *   Personal commentary and reflections on the material [01:38:18, 01:38:42].
        *   Interview questions or points needing further investigation [01:37:41, 01:37:48].
        *   Excerpts that are "neat distillations of an important idea" [01:40:44]. Excerpts are often extracted at the end of a chapter, sometimes even if they won't become prompts, for posterity [01:42:01, 01:42:11].
*   **Handwritten Notes:** Alongside digital notes, handwritten notes are taken during tutoring sessions [01:17:16]. Math work is done in physical notebooks to allow for drawing [02:00:00].

### Memory and Review: Spaced Repetition
*   **Mochi Cards Pro Plugin (Obsidian to Mochi):** The "Mochi Cards Pro" Obsidian plugin is crucial for creating and managing memory prompts [01:43:43, 01:44:02]. Prompts are written in Obsidian using a markdown heading (H6) for the question and the following block as the answer [01:45:44, 01:46:00].
*   **Benefits of Prompts:**
    *   **Knowledge Compounding:** Prompts created for past interviews (even years ago) are reused and leveraged for future interviews, making study more durable and rewarding [01:47:05, 01:47:15, 01:47:23].
    *   **Enhanced Daily Learning:** During intensive sprints, prompts aid in retaining more information, making subsequent days of study easier [01:48:11]. The humbling experience of forgetting recently learned material reinforces the value of the practice [01:49:00].
    *   **Feedback and Motivation:** Daily review of prompts provides a shorter, immediate feedback cycle (e.g., getting 90%+ correct), which is "incredibly rewarding" and combats the loneliness of solo research [01:49:40, 01:50:06]. It provides a tangible output (a growing deck) that signals progress [01:50:29].
*   **Prompt Writing Best Practices (and Exceptions):**
    *   **Empathy for Future Self:** The key meta-skill is to have empathy for one's future self to create prompts that are neither too easy nor too ambiguous [01:52:26].
    *   **Understand Before Memorize:** A core rule is not to write a prompt on something one doesn't understand, aligning with Peter C. Brown's "understand before you memorize" principle [01:52:08, 01:52:27].
    *   **Definitions as Exceptions:** Definitional terms might be prompted even without full understanding, as it helps in picking up the language and makes eventual understanding easier [01:52:42].
    *   **Iterative Refinement:** Approximately 5-10% of prompts require revision after being first written due to convoluted or unclear phrasing [01:58:09, 01:58:14]. This is done immediately on the spot to maintain a "zero inbox policy" [01:58:30, 01:58:36].
    *   **Placement of Prompts:** Prompts are placed at the bottom of a note rather than interspersed, as interspersing can be unwieldy for large notes [01:43:47, 01:44:00]. A dual-pane view in Obsidian allows writing prompts while viewing source material [01:43:08, 01:43:19].
    *   **Review Strategy:** During intensive sprints, review is focused on the current guest's prompts [01:55:37]. When between projects, a mix of prompts from different fields is reviewed [01:57:24]. The total number of cards (e.g., 1200) is ignored, and focus is kept on reviewing smaller batches (e.g., 50 at a time) [01:56:30, 01:57:01].

### Question Formulation for Interviews
*   **Kanban Board (Obsidian Kanban Plugin):** The Obsidian Kanban plugin is used to organize interview questions [02:02:50, 02:03:36]. This board uses markdown-backed cards, allowing for flexibility and portability [02:03:46, 02:04:46].
*   **Columns for Topics:** Columns are created for different topics to be discussed, plus a "to categorize" column [02:05:59, 02:06:01].
*   **Dumping Ground:** Initially, the "to categorize" column serves as a dumping ground for nascent questions, often messy with multiple versions of the same question [02:07:16, 02:07:37].
*   **Prioritization and Ordering:** The most aggressive organization and structuring of questions on the Kanban board happens a day or two before the interview [02:07:51, 02:07:56]. This allows for easy reorganization of questions to establish a desired narrative arc or prerequisite flow [02:08:12].
*   **Physical Kanban:** Sometimes, a physical Kanban board using Post-it notes (yellow for ideas/points, pink for questions) is used, offering a superior "three-dimensional" way to organize compared to digital, although it complicates transfer to digital tools [02:15:21, 02:25:40].
*   **Meta-Notes:** The Kanban board also contains "meta" notes to the interviewer, such as "to practice loading more context into the preface of a question" or reminders about the number of questions to ask in a short interview [02:25:27, 02:27:24, 02:29:25].
*   **Final Output:** Once structured, the Kanban board content is converted to markdown, copied to Google Docs for final formatting and potential sharing with collaborators for feedback, and then printed out for use during the interview [02:30:35, 02:30:50, 02:30:59].

## The Art of Interviewing as a Learning Process
Beyond domain knowledge, the interviewer continuously learns and refines the art of interviewing itself [02:33:04]. This includes:
*   **Interview Technique Prompts:** A separate deck of Mochi prompts is dedicated to interview technique, such as "Don't talk unless you can improve upon silence" [02:35:50, 02:39:50].
*   **Question Refinement:** An ongoing challenge is transforming general questions into more interesting ones (e.g., by "flipping the sign" from "what would you do?" to "what wouldn't you do?") [02:41:10, 02:41:13, 02:41:20]. Prompts are used to practice applying these techniques and reflecting on their effect [02:42:06, 02:42:15].
*   **Avoiding "Dumb" Questions:** Extensive prep, even if not directly visible, helps avoid asking questions that would make the interviewer "look like an idiot to TB" [02:45:00, 02:48:47]. Losing the guest's respect by asking silly questions ruins the interview [02:49:19].
*   **Eliciting Better Answers:** Asking penetrating questions that the guest hasn't been asked before leads to them "lean forward" and give "better answers," including unique and valuable insights [02:49:54, 02:50:08, 02:50:16].
*   **Authentic Engagement:** A rule is to only ask questions that the interviewer is genuinely interested in and "able to comprehend the answer" [02:52:27, 02:52:51]. Without comprehension, true conversation and follow-ups are impossible [02:52:56].
*   **Physical Reminders:** Hand-written notes with critical reminders (e.g., "no semantics," "concretize") are placed on the desk during interviews to guide question phrasing and avoid common pitfalls like overly abstract or definitional questions [02:39:13, 02:40:40, 02:40:51].

## Reflections on the Learning Process and Future Directions
*   **Disproportionate Prep:** There's a realization that a lot of preparation (the "iceberg") is not directly visible in the final interview, and a "large portion of prep doesn't end up being useful" [02:48:18, 02:58:39, 02:58:55]. However, this prep is valuable in itself, potentially helping avoid bad questions [02:48:45].
*   **Motivation for Prep:** The inherent value of the prep process, coupled with the desire to do more interviews, drives continued dedication [02:59:34, 02:59:42]. More efficient prep allows for a greater impact and reach [02:59:51].
*   **Broad vs. Deep Knowledge:** The interviewer acknowledges pursuing a "broad" approach across different topics, which makes knowledge accumulation slower compared to a "deep" approach focused on one field, but it still compounds over time [03:03:02, 03:06:04, 03:07:07, 03:07:50].
*   **Sharing the Process:** There's an aspiration to share elements of the preparation process publicly, including Mochi decks, Obsidian notes, video recordings of work sessions, and calls with private tutors [03:09:09, 03:13:42]. This aims to provide insight into the invisible "knowledge work" of studying and preparing, which many people find surprising and valuable [03:16:38, 03:17:00, 03:17:35]. The goal is to show what it "looks like to read a book" or to "ensure that one understands as one is reading" [03:17:46].
*   **Future System Evolution:** The current system primarily organizes by guest/folder [03:23:08]. There's a recognized need to evolve the structure to support cross-cutting learnings and conversations between different guests or topics, but the exact method for this is an "open research question" yet to be resolved [03:23:22, 03:24:19].

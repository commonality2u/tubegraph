Australian culture is characterized by its [[historical_and_cultural_roots_of_australian_egalitarianism | egalitarianism]], a trait that has been true for at least the last 150 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This ethos crystallized into a national identity around the 1890s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Paradoxically, this period was one of much higher [[economic_inequality_trends_in_Australia | economic inequality]] than today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Historical Context and Inequality Trends

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Australia was marked by stark social disparities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. For instance, Australia had a higher share of people working as domestic servants than the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. By 1910, the top 1% of the population received 12% of all personal income, and the top 0.1% received 4% of all personal income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This 4% share for the top 0.1% was 40 times their proportionate share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The history of Australian [[economic_inequality_trends_in_Australia | inequality]] post-Federation falls into two phases:
*   **Decline:** From the high levels around Federation through to the 1970s, inequality fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Rise:** From the 1980s to today, inequality has risen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While not quite as high as in the 1910s, it is "getting pretty close" depending on how it's measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Roots of Egalitarian Culture

Several factors contributed to Australia's egalitarian culture:

### Labor Scarcity
In the early days of the colony, labor was scarce while land was plentiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This imbalance gave workers a relatively more even balance of power with capitalists compared to Europe or North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Employers could not mistreat workers because there were so few of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This led to the formation of early trade unions and the emergence of the 8-hour day in the 1800s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Workers in Sydney earned significantly more than their counterparts in Chicago and London due to labor scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This environment fostered the notion that "Jack wasn't just as good as his master but maybe better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Gold Rushes
The gold rushes were a moment where "essentially luck determines your wealth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Regardless of skills or pre-existing hierarchy, individuals could gain wealth based on whether their plot contained gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This phenomenon created social fluidity and mixing, especially with massive immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. During the gold rushes, Australia's population tripled, and Melbourne's population increased sevenfold in a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Migration
The fact that most Australians in the 1800s "just gotten off a boat" (apart from First Nations people) meant that traditional hierarchies entrenched in older societies like Venice or aristocratic Europe did not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This new settlement allowed workers to shape society around their desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. While this led to greater equality among settler males, it was not true for women or First Nations people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Political Philosophy
A secondary theory suggests that when colonists set up new settlements, they carried a "shard of the European political culture" frozen at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. For Australia, the dominant political philosopher during its formation was Jeremy Bentham, leading to a culture with more [[benthamite_influence_on_australian_political_institutions | Benthamite utilitarianism]] and less Gladstonian liberalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. However, this is considered less important than the economic and social factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Cultural Manifestations of Egalitarianism

Australia is widely seen as sitting towards the egalitarian end of a global cultural continuum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This is reflected in:
*   **Lack of Deference:** Australians typically do not stand up when the Prime Minister enters a room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Public Access:** There are no private areas on Australian beaches, making it difficult to buy exclusive chunks of land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Informality:** Many Australians sit in the front seat of taxis, unlike the chauffeur approach common in other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **The Term "Mate":** The word "mate" carries a "lovely egalitarian flavor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. A "mate gate" scandal occurred in Parliament where security guards were instructed not to call parliamentarians "mate," but bipartisan outrage quickly reversed the policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. The tradition persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Post-Office Titles:** Unlike the US, where former presidents retain their title, Australia does not typically refer to former Prime Ministers as "Prime Minister" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

### The "Tall Poppy Syndrome"
While often complained about, the "tall poppy syndrome" (the tendency to cut down those who are too successful) is perceived as less prevalent in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. People are not typically horrified by success in business, sport, or arts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. However, there is a notion that being successful doesn't put someone "on a pedestal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

While some suggest the tall poppy syndrome might hinder Australian innovativeness by discouraging risk-taking compared to countries like the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, there's little evidence of a strong relationship between patent production and inequality across countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Australians are more fearful of business failure than Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. However, successful Australian entrepreneurs often attribute their success to luck rather than just skill, and look to "give back" in substantial ways, reflecting a non-materialistic drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

## Reconciling Cultural and Economic Disparities

The core question remains how to reconcile Australia's deep-seated [[historical_and_cultural_roots_of_australian_egalitarianism | cultural egalitarianism]] with rising [[economic_inequality_trends_in_Australia | economic inequality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The cultural egalitarianism is seen as "right," but its endurance is strained as economic inequality increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

Over recent decades, the share of Australian wealth held by the top 200 richest individuals has increased fivefold, and for the top 20, it has increased ninefold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Increases have been observed in expenditure, income, and wealth inequality, further exacerbated by the run-up in house prices which has widened the gap between the "haves and have-nots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. These trends put pressure on Australian egalitarian values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

Maintaining Australia's redistributive social safety net is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>. Australia's social safety net is the most redistributive in the world, giving 12 times as much welfare to someone in the bottom fifth of the distribution as to someone in the top fifth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>. This efficiency is something to be proud of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>.# Australian Egalitarianism and its Historical Context

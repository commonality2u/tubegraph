## Lack of Presidential Declaration

Since China's emergence as a great power in the early post-Cold War years, no American president has publicly declared addressing China a national mission, demanding a whole-of-nation commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This lack of presidential leadership means the public has not been rallied to confront the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## The Scale of the Challenge

The economic challenge posed by China is significantly larger than previous historical rivals. China's economy is well past 60% of American GDP, making it a much bigger challenge than the [[comparison_of_china_challenge_to_cold_war | Cold War]] in most respects, and economically larger than the challenges posed by Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Successfully addressing this requires a "whole of nation" effort, extending beyond just the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Broader Societal Engagement Needed

A comprehensive national response to the China challenge cannot be undertaken discreetly or solely within the confines of a [[beltway_community_vs_popular_culture_on_china_threat | Beltway project]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. It necessitates a broad societal commitment initiated by the American president directly appealing to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Intellectual and Cultural Readiness Gap

The [[us_intellectual_and_cultural_readiness_for_china_challenge | intellectual environment in the US]] does not currently suggest the nation is prepared for a contest of this magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

*   **Popular Culture:** There is a noticeable absence of focus on China in [[beltway_community_vs_popular_culture_on_china_threat | popular culture]], with no widespread public obsession or engagement from prominent commentators like Joe Rogan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Discourse:** While academic and policy circles within the "Beltway crowd"—such as scholars, think tankers, political advisers, and military analysts, and publications like *Foreign Affairs*—are extensively engaged with the China challenge and threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, this deep engagement does not extend to broader intellectual figures like David Brooks or Ross Douthat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the [[comparison_of_china_challenge_to_cold_war | Cold War]], which saw the development of "Cold War liberalism" as an entire school of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, and even the War on Terrorism, which captivated major public intellectuals and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Missing Ferment:** The necessary intellectual ferment to support the scale of the challenge that the American governing class claims to be undertaking is currently lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

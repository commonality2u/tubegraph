Despite dark predictions in the 1960s, including from figures like John F. Kennedy, that there would be dozens of nuclear states within a generation, the world today has only nine. This containment of proliferation from five nuclear weapon states in 1968 to just four more is a remarkable success story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
A significant factor in the relative success of [[the_role_of_the_nuclear_nonproliferation_treaty | nuclear nonproliferation]] was the establishment of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Origin and Purpose
The decision to create the NPT followed the Cuban Missile Crisis, where the world was "so close to blowing up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Correspondence between Kennedy and Khrushchev after the crisis quickly led to the decision for such a treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The NPT, tabled in 1968 and effective in 1970, was based on a fundamental bargain: non-nuclear powers would not acquire nuclear weapons, and in return, they would receive support for peaceful uses of nuclear energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Additionally, nuclear powers promised to work towards universal nuclear disarmament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This treaty is considered the "cornerstone of nuclear arms control" and a "fundamental document" that should be viewed at the level of a charter commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:24">[02:26:24]</a>.

The NPT established a norm against the possession of nuclear weapons, asserting that "no one should have nuclear weapons" because "they are too devastating and dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:58">[02:26:58]</a>. States that have joined and ratified the NPT have conformed to its provisions, neither acquiring nuclear weapons themselves nor assisting others in doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:04">[02:28:04]</a>.

### Indefinite Extension
The NPT was initially given a 25-year lifespan and came up for renewal in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>. Its indefinite extension was crucial, as failure to renew it then would have made resurrection much harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. Australian Diplomat Richard Butler played a critical role in engineering this indefinite extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

A major challenge for the extension was the unfulfilled bargain: non-nuclear weapon states felt that nuclear weapon states had not upheld their promise to disarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>. To address this, Butler proposed a separate, supplementary set of politically binding documents that prescribed better behavior from nuclear weapon states regarding disarmament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>. These included commitments to a fissile materials cut-off treaty, a reaffirmation of NPT Article VI commitments, and crucially, a commitment to a [[the_comprehensive_nucleartestban_treaty_negotiations | Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] (CTBT) by 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a>. This solution, negotiated in a private meeting at Butler's residence, allowed the NPT to be indefinitely extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:02">[02:18:02]</a>.

## The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)
The CTBT, which aims to stop all nuclear tests by explosion in all environments for all time, was a key goal for nonproliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:44">[02:47:44]</a>. Banning nuclear testing is critical because a new nuclear weapon state would need to test its device to ensure it works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:18">[02:39:18]</a>.

### Overcoming Obstacles
Negotiations for the CTBT in Geneva were held hostage by India, which withheld consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:43">[02:39:43]</a>. Richard Butler bypassed this by tabling an identical treaty text in the UN General Assembly under Australia's name, circumventing the Conference on Disarmament's consensus rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:57">[02:42:57]</a>. This "homeric trick" was a novel diplomatic maneuver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:03">[02:43:03]</a>. The General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted the text, opening it for signature by all states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:01">[02:46:01]</a>.

### Verification Mechanism
The CTBT spawned an impressive International Monitoring System (IMS), primarily a seismological system that registers tremors to detect underground explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:32">[02:36:32]</a>. There are also overhead systems to look for other signs of detonations. Data collected is analyzed at the headquarters in Vienna, and notices are sent to participating states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:34">[02:37:34]</a>. This system can discriminate between natural events like earthquakes and nuclear explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:02">[02:48:02]</a>.

Nuclear weapons technology leaves a large, easily detectable footprint due to the need for large plants to enrich uranium or separate plutonium, as well as clear material throughput figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:47">[02:51:47]</a>. This makes their proliferation harder to conceal compared to chemical or biological weapons, where dual-use capabilities make verification more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">[02:59:52]</a>.

## Challenges to Nonproliferation
Despite the NPT's success, several challenges and flaws remain:

### Unfulfilled Bargain
The "basic bargain" of the NPT, where nuclear weapon states commit to disarmament, has not been fully implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>. There has been no serious progress in moving towards the elimination of existing stockpiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:42">[01:15:42]</a>. This failure causes restlessness among non-nuclear signatories and remains a major issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>.

### States Not Party to the NPT
The countries that have developed nuclear weapons outside the NPT framework—India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea—are not signatories to the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. These states were never going to join a treaty that would prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons, often due to hostile standoffs with neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:31">[02:29:31]</a>. For example, Israel is widely believed to possess around 200 nuclear explosive devices, though it has never publicly conceded this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:51">[02:33:51]</a>.

### CTBT Entry into Force Stringency
The CTBT has not yet legally entered into force because its threshold for entry into force required ratification by 44 specific states that had participated in negotiations and possessed nuclear power or research reactors, including India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:51">[02:29:51]</a>. This provision was perhaps "too stringent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:42">[02:30:42]</a>, though the treaty is largely "being acted upon as if it has" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:21">[02:31:21]</a>.

## Australia's Role in Nonproliferation
Australia has a storied history in the cause of nuclear nonproliferation, often acting as a "middle power" and a "good international citizen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:58">[02:17:58]</a>.

### Initial Hesitation
Despite its later advocacy, Australia initially refused to sign the NPT for two years under the Gorton government (1968-1970), being the second-last country to sign before the treaty entered into force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>. The primary reason was to keep open the option of developing its own nuclear arsenal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. Sir Philip Baxter, chairman of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and a former Manhattan Project scientist, heavily influenced Prime Minister John Gorton, advocating for Australia's right to develop nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:27">[05:00:27]</a>. This internal debate was "line ball," with a serious possibility of Australia pursuing nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

### Ambassador for Disarmament
In 1983, Australia appointed its first Ambassador for Disarmament, Richard Butler, a unique appointment at the time, followed only by Mexico's Alfonso García Robles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:02">[02:49:02]</a>. This role, which involved leading Australian disarmament negotiations worldwide, significantly raised Australia's profile and influence in international arms control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:07">[02:50:07]</a>.

## The Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons
In 1996, the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons was formed by Prime Minister Paul Keating to develop a practical program for nuclear disarmament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:36">[02:07:36]</a>. Its core syllogism, widely recognized for its "clarion statement," articulates the fundamental reasons for elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>:
*   As long as nuclear weapons exist, other states will want to acquire them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:47">[02:11:47]</a>.
*   As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will one day be used, by accident or design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:56">[02:11:56]</a>.
*   Any such use would be catastrophic for the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:01">[02:12:01]</a>.

This commission concluded that nuclear weapons "must be done" and the means to do so, through treaties like a test-ban treaty and a cut-off treaty for fissile material production, are well known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:55">[02:10:55]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Deterrence
The world is currently seeing deeply disturbing language about the possible use of nuclear weapons, including talk of "tactical use" which is considered "nonsense" as "once that line is crossed, states in possession of nuclear weapons are going to start loading up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. The concept of "minimal deterrence" is also dismissed as an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:44">[02:21:44]</a>.

There is concern that the window on disarmament may be closing due to a new era of strategic competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:40">[02:06:40]</a>. However, there is ongoing awareness that as long as nuclear weapons exist, they pose an existential threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:01">[02:10:01]</a>.

### [[credibility_of_american_extended_nuclear_deterrence | Credibility of American extended nuclear deterrence]]
There is skepticism about the [[credibility_of_american_extended_nuclear_deterrence | credibility of American extended nuclear deterrence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:03">[02:12:03]</a>. Doubts exist that the United States would risk nuclear war to protect allies, a concern echoed by John Gorton in 1968 regarding [[nuclear_blackmail_and_its_impact_on_international_relations | nuclear blackmail]] or attack on Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>. Current policy, such as the [[implications_of_the_aukus_agreement_on_nuclear_power | AUKUS agreement]] for submarines, is seen by some as making Australia a "military colony of the United States" and hindering an independent foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:05">[02:23:05]</a>. The presence of US joint facilities in Australia, including airfields used by nuclear-capable B-52 bombers, is seen as contrary to nuclear non-proliferation obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:50">[02:47:50]</a>.

### Complacency about Proliferation
There appears to be a general complacency about proliferation today, even among great powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:47">[02:23:47]</a>. This might be due to "other fish to fry," such as climate change and global economic problems, with a calculation that existing nuclear weapon states will manage their own arsenals and other countries have different priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:37">[02:24:37]</a>.

## Advice for Future Diplomats
For young people interested in reducing the risk of nuclear war, key advice includes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:27">[02:25:27]</a>:
*   **Learn the facts**: Many young people are unaware that nuclear weapons still exist and pose a serious threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:04">[02:26:04]</a>.
*   **Study**: Gain proper education in nuclear science and technology, international politics (especially multilateral aspects), and international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:05">[02:27:05]</a>.
*   **Learn foreign languages**: Essential for international affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:32">[02:28:32]</a>.
*   **Develop listening skills**: The most important skill for a professional diplomat is the ability to listen carefully and discern what is truly being said, as negotiators often unwittingly reveal their true intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:55">[02:26:55]</a>.

Since China's rise as a [[us_and_china_strategic_relationship|great power]] in the post-Cold War years, no American president has declared the challenge posed by China as a national mission requiring the entire country's devotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## The Scale of the Challenge

The current challenge from China is economically larger than that posed by the Cold War, or even Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. China's GDP is well past 60% of American GDP, a figure no other power has ever approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This means the required response is a "whole of nation" effort, not just a "whole of government" one, surpassing even the scale of the [[comparison_of_chinas_challenge_to_historical_threats_like_cold_war_and_world_war_II|Cold War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Such an undertaking cannot be pursued quietly or as a "Beltway project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. It necessitates a direct address from the American president to the public, urging collective effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Lack of Societal Engagement

The [[assessment_of_americas_preparedness_for_a_contest_with_china|intellectual environment]] in the United States does not suggest the country is ready for such a contest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Popular Culture

The [[lack_of_intellectual_and_popular_cultural_engagement_with_chinas_challenge|popular culture]] shows little engagement with the China challenge. For instance, popular commentators like Joe Rogan are not "obsessed" with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Intellectual Discourse

Beyond the Washington D.C. "Beltway crowd," the necessary [[role_of_american_intellectuals_and_media_in_addressing_the_china_challenge|intellectual heft]] is largely absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. While many American scholars, think tankers, political advisers, and military analysts write books and articles in specialized journals like *Foreign Affairs* about the [[us_china_economic_and_military_power_dynamics|China Challenge]] and threat, this discourse does not extend broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Prominent public intellectuals such as David Brooks and Ross Douthat are not writing books on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

This situation contrasts sharply with historical periods:
*   **The Cold War**: The [[comparison_of_chinas_challenge_to_historical_threats_like_cold_war_and_world_war_II|Cold War]] saw the emergence of "Cold War liberalism" as an entire school of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **The War on Terrorism**: Figures like Andrew Sullivan, Christopher Hitchens, Paul Berman, Michael Ignatieff, and *The New York Times* editorial page were extensively engaged with questions surrounding liberal democracy in the face of radical Islamist threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Currently, there is no similar "intellectual ferment" in the United States to support the scale of the challenge that the governing class claims to be undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

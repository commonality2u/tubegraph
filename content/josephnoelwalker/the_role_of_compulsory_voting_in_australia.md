Australia's voting system is an anomaly among English-speaking democracies, primarily due to its compulsory voting, which is unique among these nations where voting is typically voluntary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This contrasts sharply with countries like the United States, where voting is voluntary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Historical and Philosophical Context
Australia's political culture is often described as majoritarian and bureaucratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:58">[01:54:58]</a>. H.W. Arndt referred to Australia as a [[benthamite_influence_on_australian_political_institutions | Benthamite society]] because when its political institutions were being established, Jeremy Bentham's brand of utilitarianism was the prevailing political philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This contrasts with America, where John Locke's ideas influenced the setup of institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:54">[02:17:54]</a>.

In this Benthamite view, rights are seen as given by government, rather than existing prior to it, unlike the social contract theory prevalent in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:01">[06:06:01]</a>. This foundational difference meant that Australia's political reformers focused on making existing institutions operate more democratically and efficiently for the benefit of a greater number of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

Another contributing factor to Australia's unique political culture was the low taxation environment for its first 100 years, as the British government largely funded colonial administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. This led Australians to view government as a "large public utility" that provided services without significant cost, fostering trust in government as potentially benevolent rather than oppressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. This dependence on government for infrastructure development and assisted migration further ingrained a belief in its positive role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.

## Arguments for Compulsory Voting
Discussions about introducing compulsory voting in Australian colonies began in the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>. The primary argument in favor was that it would ensure the government had the support of the majority of all eligible voters, not just those who chose to turn up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>.

Unlike in the United States, philosophical arguments against compulsory voting, such as those concerning liberty, individual conscience, or freedom, were rarely raised in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>. Opposition was primarily pragmatic, focusing on administrative difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>.

Compulsory voting in Australia was ultimately seen as a means to ensure a more representative mandate for the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>. This aligns with the majoritarian aspect of Australian political culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>.

### Evolution and Passage of Legislation
The Labor Party initially opposed compulsory voting, mainly due to concerns that it could compromise the secrecy of the ballot through necessary postal or proxy voting arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:00">[42:47:00]</a>. However, their stance changed after the introduction of compulsory registration in 1911 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:17:00">[43:17:00]</a>.

Compulsory permanent registration, where citizens are automatically placed and remain on the electoral roll, made compulsory voting almost inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:46:00">[43:46:00]</a>. Bureaucrats, who put significant effort into maintaining these rolls, supported compulsory voting as it would maximize the benefit of their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:11:00">[44:11:00]</a>.

The bill for compulsory voting finally passed in 1924 with surprisingly little debate—about an hour in the Senate—and only one recorded dissenting vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57:00">[22:57:57]</a>. The single dissenter was a Labor MP who, despite his anti-conscription views, voted with his caucus, highlighting the lack of strong opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:00]</a>.

## Impact on Political Culture and Stability
Compulsory voting has reinforced Australia's majoritarian political culture over time, as citizens become accustomed to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>. It is both a cause and a consequence of this aspect of the political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>.

One significant benefit of compulsory voting is that it encourages political parties to appeal to the "moderate middle" rather than focusing on highly emotive issues to mobilize specific voter bases, as is often seen in voluntary voting systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>. This is because all eligible voters, including those less interested in politics, are required to cast a vote, theoretically leading to more level-headed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>.

>[!NOTE] The Australian ballot
Australia was the first country to establish an independent and professional electoral administration, becoming an electoral innovator since the mid-19th century. Most notably, Australia invented the "Australian ballot," which is characterized by segmented polling booths and a ballot paper where voters tick their preferred candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

## Interplay with Other Electoral Features
Compulsory voting works in conjunction with other features of the [[australias_electoral_system_and_its_uniqueness | Australian electoral system]], such as [[the_development_and_impact_of_preferential_voting_in_australia | preferential voting]] and the independent electoral commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>. The ability to vote at any polling booth within one's state also enhances accessibility for a mobile population, a feature strongly advocated for by the Labor Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This feature, combined with the vote being tied to the individual rather than a household, further supported universal suffrage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Compulsory voting remains popular in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>. Recent events, such as the rise of figures like Donald Trump in the US, have made Australians more conscious of the benefits of compulsory voting as a political stabilizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>.

While there's a decline in trust in political institutions, this is linked to increased inequality rather than issues with compulsory voting itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>. The argument that compulsory voting helps mitigate political extremism by requiring broader participation is often cited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>.

However, the increasing complexity of Australian society and the loosening of traditional party loyalties mean that voters are now more susceptible to misinformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>. While compulsory voting ensures engagement, the quality of information voters receive is a new challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>.

Proposed improvements to the Australian electoral system include potentially allowing permanent residents to vote, a practice adopted by New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>. However, suggestions like voting from home are strongly opposed, as the act of voting is considered a public obligation that helps ground citizens in the reality of living in a diverse society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>. Similarly, opinions on extending the franchise to 16-year-olds are mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>.

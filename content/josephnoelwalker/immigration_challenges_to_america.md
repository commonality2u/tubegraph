The journey to immigrate to America, particularly from a communist country in the 1980s, presented significant personal, financial, and governmental hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Personal Journey and Resilience

One individual's path to America was shaped by professional setbacks, including being told at her 30th birthday that she had six months to leave her institute and find a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. She reflects that being "kicked out" multiple times was crucial to her eventual success, emphasizing the importance of not taking such events personally and focusing on the next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Financial and Governmental Barriers to Emigration

In 1985, when Hungary was still a communist state, authorities implemented strict measures to prevent defection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. These measures severely limited the financial resources and freedom of movement for those wishing to leave the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Official Currency Restrictions

The Hungarian government allowed an emigrating family—consisting of a husband, wife, and their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter—to take only $50 for the daughter and $50 for the husband, totaling $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The wife was instructed to ask her employer for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This meager sum was meant to deter movement by making it impossible for a small family to live upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Furthermore, the Hungarian currency was not convertible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Citizens could not freely exchange Hungarian currency for foreign currency like dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. If foreign currency was acquired, it had to be handed over to the bank, which would then return Hungarian currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. It was illegal to possess foreign currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Black Market and Smuggling Necessity

To overcome these severe financial limitations, the family resorted to illicit means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. They sold their Russian car on the black market, converting the proceeds into foreign currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This was done by exchanging money with Arabic students who had foreign currency, acquiring approximately $1200 equivalent in pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

To transport this essential money out of Hungary, they smuggled it by hiding it in their daughter's teddy bear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The money was wrapped, stitched into the bear, and carefully guarded at the airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The child, being only two and a half years old, was unaware of the hidden funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This act of smuggling was common among Hungarians needing to leave with more than the officially allowed $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

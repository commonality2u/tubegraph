The setting of key economic and financial targets, such as inflation targets and capital requirements, often involves a balance between perceived reasonableness and practical effectiveness. While the specific numerical targets might seem arbitrary, their primary purpose is to establish a stable and predictable economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Basel Capital Requirements

Initially, the Basel Capital requirements were set at 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This figure was chosen as a "reasonable thing," not too close to zero and not excessively high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The 2% Inflation Target

Similarly, the 2% inflation target operates on a comparable principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The [[rationale_behind_the_2_inflation_target | rationale behind the 2 inflation target]] is that 2% is a level where some inflation is present, but it is not significant enough for people to be particularly concerned about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Studies suggest that inflation typically becomes a problem in the double digits, providing a significant margin between 2% and problematic levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

The primary concern with higher inflation is its potential to "start getting a life of its own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Therefore, the goal is to maintain a level of inflation low enough that it remains below the radar of most people, allowing expectations to anchor around that figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. At higher levels, relative price movements can transform into more absolute price movements, leading to [[consequences_of_higher_than_2_inflation | more generalized inflation]] stemming from specific price increases like oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Arbitrary Nature and Consistency

While the specific numbers for these targets might appear arbitrarily chosen, the greater importance lies in their consistency and the ability of authorities to reliably meet them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## [[challenges_in_adjusting_inflation_targets | Challenges in Adjusting Inflation Targets]]

Changing an established inflation target, such as moving from 2% to 4%, presents significant [[challenges_in_adjusting_inflation_targets | challenges in adjusting inflation targets]] and is rarely well-timed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **When inflation is high:** If inflation is significantly above 2% and the target is raised to 4%, it could be perceived as an admission of defeat, suggesting an inability to bring inflation back down to the original target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **When inflation is low:** Conversely, if inflation is at or below 2%, proposing a 4% target seems "ridiculous" because the primary challenge is often to get inflation *up* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Historical Context

The [[historical_context_of_inflation_targets_and_central_bank_policies | historical context of inflation targets and central bank policies]] shows that before the pandemic, the Federal Reserve (FED) grappled with persistently low inflation, which averaged around 1.2% over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Instead of changing the numerical target from 2% to 4%, the FED opted to modify its framework to be more accommodating of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This approach allowed for greater flexibility in achieving the target without signaling a change in the long-term goal.

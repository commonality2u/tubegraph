Adversity, while challenging, can be a profound catalyst for personal growth and success. One individual recounts multiple instances of being "kicked out" from positions, including a significant event at their 30th birthday when they were given six months to leave their institute and find a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Learning from Setbacks

The speaker emphasizes that these repeated expulsions were crucial to their current standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A key lesson learned from these experiences is the importance of not taking professional setbacks personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

> "If I wouldn't be kicked out that many times I wouldn't be here because it is important that don't take personally don't take that you know somebody is deciding on that that you are you know a loser what is important what you do next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

The focus, they suggest, should always be on the subsequent actions rather than the perceived judgment of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Emigration from Communist Hungary

Another significant period of adversity was the emigration from communist Hungary to America in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This transition was fraught with difficulties, largely due to the Hungarian communist regime's efforts to prevent defection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Financial Restrictions and Smuggling

The government severely limited the amount of money families could take out of the country. A family comprising the speaker, their husband, and a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter was only officially allowed to leave with $100 ($50 for the daughter, $50 for the husband) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The intention behind these severe restrictions was to limit movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

To circumvent these rules, the family resorted to unofficial means to acquire more funds:
*   **Selling a Car on the Black Market** They sold their Russian car officially but exchanged the Hungarian currency on the black market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This was necessary because Hungarian currency was not convertible, meaning one could not freely purchase foreign currency like dollars with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Foreign currency received had to be given to the bank for Hungarian currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Smuggling Money** Through this illicit exchange, they obtained approximately $800 to $1,200 equivalent in foreign currency (pounds initially exchanged for dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This money, considered a "lot of money" at the time, was hidden and smuggled out of the country inside their daughter Susan's teddy bear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The money was wrapped, stitched into the bear, and carefully guarded at the airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Their daughter, being only two and a half, was unaware of the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This act was against the law, but deemed necessary for their departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

This experience of navigating severe financial and political restrictions highlights the lengths individuals would go to overcome adversity and secure a future.

[[Public opinion on nuclear weapons | Public opinion]] in Australia regarding nuclear matters has shown unexpected shifts. A 2022 poll conducted by the Lowy Institute revealed that approximately 36% of Australians either support or strongly support the US acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This finding was surprising to some observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Historical Context and Recent Shifts

Historically, Australia has had a strong [[australias_historical_antinuclear_stance | anti-nuclear stance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, with notable [[australias_historical_stance_on_nuclear_weapons | anti-nuclear campaigns]] prevalent in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

When the AUKUS agreement was announced, it was anticipated that [[australias_historical_antinuclear_stance | anti-nuclear campaigns]] would ramp up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. However, this did not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. There has been no significant popular reaction to the idea of Australia housing nuclear reactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, which suggests that Australians may be more relaxed about nuclear power than previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Interpreting Public Opinion Polls

Poll questions, such as those regarding [[australian_public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons_acquisition | Australians' desire for nuclear weapons]], are typically presented without counterfactuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For instance, respondents are not asked if they would want nuclear weapons if it incurred specific costs or meant sacrificing other priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Instead, they are simply asked if they "like nuclear weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

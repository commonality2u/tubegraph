Initially, the goal of research was to create therapeutic protein-coding RNA without inflammatory molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This led to questions about why synthetically produced RNA seemed to be inflammatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> and how it differed from RNA naturally found inside cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Inflammatory Nature of External RNA

The inflammatory response observed with synthetic RNA is attributed to its introduction from outside the cell into immune cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. RNA is generally not expected to be found outside the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This observation spurred investigations into [[understanding_immune_response_to_external_rna | understanding immune response to external RNA]].

## Experimental Comparison

To determine if synthetic RNA differed from cellular RNA in its immune response, researchers devised an experiment:
1.  **Isolation**: RNA was isolated from human cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
2.  **Synthesis**: RNA was also produced *in vitro* (in a tube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
3.  **Testing**: Both types of RNA were then introduced to human immune cells, specifically dendritic cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Initially, it was expected that all tested RNA would activate immune responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Unexpected Discovery: [[transfer_rna_and_immune_response | Transfer RNA]]

During the experiments, a surprising finding emerged: [[transfer_rna_and_immune_response | Transfer RNA]] (tRNA) did not induce any immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This was in contrast to most other RNA types, including *in vitro*-made RNA, which typically did induce an immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### The Role of [[nucleoside_modifications_and_nonimmunogenic_rna | Nucleoside Modifications]]

This led to the hypothesis that [[transfer_rna_and_immune_response | Transfer RNA]]'s non-immunogenic property might be due to its high content of [[nucleoside_modifications_and_nonimmunogenic_rna | modified nucleosides]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The immediate challenge became how to prove this by creating RNA with specific [[nucleoside_modifications_and_nonimmunogenic_rna | nucleoside modifications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

The original goal was not to specifically create non-immunogenic RNA, but rather to understand if synthetic RNA differed from natural cellular RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The method to confirm this difference was to isolate RNA from cells, synthesize it in a tube, and then observe the cellular response when exposed to both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. It was confirmed that most RNA does induce an immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, and even RNA from within the body can cause inflammatory reactions when it comes out due to injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

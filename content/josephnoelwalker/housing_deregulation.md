[[Zoning regulations and their impact on housing supply | Housing deregulation]] involves removing or easing restrictions on construction and land use, with the goal of increasing housing supply and making it more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The book "Build Baby Build: The Science and Ethics of Housing Regulation" specifically addresses this topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Impact of Housing Deregulation
Full [[Zoning regulations and their impact on housing supply | housing deregulation]] in America would lead to significant changes in urban and suburban landscapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Cities**: Downtowns, being the most regulated, would see the largest gains in development, making it easier to build skyscrapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Stricter regulations on historic sites and demolition, as seen in San Francisco, would also be relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Suburbs**: It would become easier to build multi-family housing, as approximately 80% of residential land is currently reserved for single-family homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Land Use**: Even for single-family homes, deregulation would eliminate minimum lot size regulations, which often require wasting large amounts of land (e.g., one, two, or even five acres per house) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Affordability and Space**: Overall, deregulation would mean more space and affordability for everyone, allowing for larger, yet cheaper, apartments in dense areas like Manhattan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This could also lead to a decrease in concerns about small family sizes in urban areas, as people would not be limited to "shoe box" apartments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Measuring Impact: The "Zoning Tax"
Researchers Joe Gyourko and Ed Glaeser pioneered an approach to measure the [[Zoning regulations and their impact on housing supply | impact of zoning regulations on house prices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Methodology**: They compare similar homes, some with more undeveloped land, to assess the value people place on pure land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This marginal value is found to be low, indicating that regulations forcing people to buy extra land are inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. They then calculate the difference between market prices and physical construction costs, treating this residual as the "zoning tax" or regulatory burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Critiques and Validation**: Critics argue that the low valuation of marginal land is due to its indivisibility, making it unusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. However, this is less relevant for [[Zoning regulations and their impact on housing supply | zoning regulations]] like minimum lot sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Developers typically build up to the legal limit, demonstrating a low appreciation for extra land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Later work by Gyourko, using prices of actual vacant lots, yielded similar results, suggesting the method is sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### [[Impact of housing deregulation on productivity | Productivity Gains]]
Housing deregulation is argued to lead to massive [[impact_of_housing_deregulation_on_productivity | productivity gains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.
*   **Internal Migration**: Historically, people in the US moved from low-wage, low-productivity areas (e.g., rural Mississippi) to high-wage, high-productivity areas (e.g., California) for better pay and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This internal migration was common because their productivity was higher in the new locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>.
*   **Current State**: In the modern US, despite large productivity gaps between regions, internal mobility has fallen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. High-skilled workers still move to high-productivity areas, but low-skilled workers are moving in reverse, from high-wage places like San Francisco to lower-wage places like Texas, due to extremely high housing prices in productive areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
*   **Restoring Mobility**: If housing costs were reduced to reasonable levels, this traditional pattern of workers moving to higher-wage, higher-productivity areas would be restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. This would lead to significant national productivity gains.

### Research on Productivity Gains
A famous 2019 paper by Hsieh and Moretti on agglomeration gains was found to contain basic errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.
*   **Initial Error**: Initial errors found in the paper by Brian Caplan were actually *against* the authors' thesis, meaning the gains from deregulating housing were even larger than originally found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.
*   **Model Flaws**: A later critique by Brian Greeny suggested that the model used was strange, conceptualizing deregulation as increasing sensitivity of construction to price, rather than simply breaking a dam and allowing more building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.
*   **Academic Quality Control**: This highlights a potential issue in academia where intellectual demand is prioritized over basic arithmetic checks, leading to errors in influential papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. Corrections often do not affect citations, indicating a lower overall quality control than it appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

### Challenges to Productivity Gains
*   **Dilution of Talent**: A critique suggests that if cities like the Bay Area were deregulated, the influx of millions of people would dilute the talent pool and reduce innovativeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>. However, a large percentage of city populations are not "ultra high-skilled" (e.g., janitors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>, and many residents were born there, indicating that high wages aren't the only factor keeping people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. The argument is that adding more lower-skilled workers would not necessarily "mess up" innovation, especially if it triples low-skilled workers and raises high-skilled workers by 50%, thereby still raising total innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.
*   **Economies of Scale and Prices**: There is a concern that enabling more building in major cities could intensify economies of scale and agglomeration effects, raising productivity and incomes, which could ultimately translate into higher rents and prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. However, the argument is that it is "totally possible to just keep building more buildings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. The supply of builders is almost unlimited, unlike the scarce supply of "incredible human talent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.
*   **Entrepreneurship**: The models used in [[impact_of_housing_deregulation_on_productivity | productivity analyses]] typically put entrepreneurship into "total factor productivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>, which is generally treated as a fixed quantity. This means that the dynamic effects of deregulation on entrepreneurial activity are not explicitly modeled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

## [[relationship_between_immigration_and_housing | Relationship Between Immigration and Housing]]
The [[relationship_between_immigration_and_housing | relationship between immigration and housing]] has become a zero-sum issue in some countries like Canada and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **US Context**: For the United States, it is argued that full housing deregulation isn't a prerequisite for high immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Since most regulations are local, there's significant variation, and immigrants naturally move to areas with lighter regulation and affordable housing, such as Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Call for Building**: Instead of blaming immigrants for driving up prices, the focus should be on allowing the construction industry to build more homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Many construction workers themselves are often immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Historical Context**: US housing coped well with modest regulation for 50 years (from the 1920s), suggesting that regulation is problematic in principle but only harmful when strict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **"Shock Doctrine"**: A "shock doctrine" approach is suggested: deregulate other sectors first, and the resulting pressure might force [[Zoning regulations and their impact on housing supply | housing deregulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

## Fertility and Density
While some research suggests an association between population density and reduced fertility rates (e.g., Tokyo, Seoul) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>, this view is challenged.
*   **Price vs. Density**: It is argued that high density and high prices usually go hand-in-hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>, making it difficult to disentangle their effects on fertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>. Places with high density but cheap housing are rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>.
*   **Suburban Deregulation**: Allowing cheaper suburban housing is likely to raise fertility because it provides more space and makes it easier for people to move out of their parents' basements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Cultural and Economic Factors**: The general trend of declining fertility in wealthier societies is acknowledged, with housing being one area where economic progress has been stifled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. Cultural shifts towards a "life of play" and less emphasis on having children also contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>. However, shifting the economic dial through deregulation can be a sensible response to low fertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.

## Political and Cultural Resistance
[[Zoning regulations and their impact on housing supply | Housing deregulation]] faces significant political and cultural resistance.
*   **NIMBYism vs. YIMBYism**: While the YIMBY ("Yes In My Back Yard") movement advocates for more housing, opposition often comes from NIMBY ("Not In My Back Yard") sentiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:16">[01:20:16]</a>.
*   **Supply Skepticism**: Surveys in the US and Australia show that many believe a large increase in housing stock would cause prices to *rise*, not fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>. This "supply skepticism" is rooted not in self-interest (as homeowners would benefit from rising prices) but in a general dislike of construction and a belief that it would be "bad in general for human beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>.
*   **Philosophical Opposition**: Resistance to deregulation is often philosophical, not based on material self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:41">[01:23:41]</a>. Opponents cite concerns like increased traffic, parking problems, blocked views, and shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:29">[01:26:29]</a>. They also use arguments such as disrupting migratory birds, refusing to put a price tag on such concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:06">[01:26:06]</a>.
*   **State-Level Action**: Major YIMBY movements often occur at the state level, where governments can pressure localities to deregulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>. For example, some states have officially ended single-family zoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:31">[01:28:31]</a>. This is sometimes driven by elites who recognize the policy's benefits, hoping public appreciation for lower prices will outweigh initial dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>.
*   **Political Coding**: Currently, [[Zoning regulations and their impact on housing supply | housing abundance]] seems bipartisan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:03">[01:32:03]</a>. However, because vocal activists tend to be left-wing (e.g., in major blue cities), it is likely to be perceived as a "left-wing" issue, even though red states often have lighter regulation by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:15">[01:33:15]</a>.
*   **Legal Challenges**: The 1926 Euclid v. Ambler Supreme Court decision gave local governments broad power to impose zoning rules, viewing apartments as potential "nuisances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>. Overturning this decision would be difficult, as local and state governments would likely resist and find loopholes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>.

## Aesthetics and Urbanism
The aesthetic concerns about new construction are often based on imagination of what a deregulated world would look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:07">[01:15:07]</a>.
*   **Vision of the Future**: A deregulated future could lead to gorgeous, futuristic cities, challenging the pessimistic views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>. Historically, major urban changes initially met with resistance later became loved and normalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>.
*   **The "Bastiat Buildings"**: This concept, inspired by Frédéric Bastiat's "What is Seen and What is Not Seen," argues that people focus on visible complaints about new construction (e.g., shadows, traffic) but ignore the unseen benefits of increased supply and affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>. The refusal to put a price tag on minor complaints like "bothering birds" reflects a philosophical, rather than pragmatic, opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:06">[01:26:06]</a>.
*   **Japan as an Example**: Japan's urbanism demonstrates the benefits of less regulation, such as easy mixed-use development (shops on ground floors of residential buildings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>. Their cities also had minimal historic preservation laws due to wartime destruction, allowing for constant rebuilding and modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>. While their mass transit is highly efficient, its cost-effectiveness still requires in-depth analysis beyond direct observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:40">[01:12:40]</a>.

## Long-Term Outlook
In the very long run, human history might inevitably lead to a densified planet, resembling Coruscant from Star Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>.
*   **Evolutionary Pressure**: Despite current low fertility rates, evolutionary pressures stemming from genetically based variation in fertility and preference for children will eventually lead to a population that is "very pronatal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:02">[01:43:02]</a>. This transformation of human psychology, occurring over centuries, will drive sustained high population growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:33">[01:43:33]</a>.
*   **Maxing Out Earth**: The Earth has vast untapped potential for density, with solutions like draining oceans for more land being more feasible than colonizing other planets in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:43">[01:45:43]</a>. The costs and challenges of interstellar travel make multi-planetary civilization a distant prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:17">[01:45:17]</a>.

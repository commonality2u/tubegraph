Research into therapeutic protein-coding RNA initially aimed to create molecules that would not elicit an inflammatory response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This led to an investigation into why synthetically produced RNA seemed to be inflammatory when compared to RNA found within cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Problem of Inflammatory RNA

The primary hypothesis was that the [[mRNA and its inflammatory response | inflammatory response]] occurs because external RNA is introduced to immune cells, and RNA is not naturally found outside of a cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The goal was to understand if the synthetically made RNA differed from what is naturally present inside human cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Experimental Approach

To test this, researchers decided to:
1.  Isolate RNA directly from human cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
2.  Produce RNA *in vitro* (in a tube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
3.  Expose special human immune cells (dendritic cells) to both types of RNA to observe their immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Initially, it was expected that both synthetic and cell-derived RNA would activate an immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Key Discoveries

### Non-Immunogenic RNA

During the experiments, various types of RNA were tested, including [[Transfer RNA and immune response | Transfer RNA]] (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from human cells, as well as different bacterial RNAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. A significant finding was that [[Transfer RNA and immune response | Transfer RNA]] did not induce any immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### The Role of Nucleoside Modifications

This led to the hypothesis that [[Nucleoside modifications and nonimmunogenic RNA | nucleoside modifications]] play a crucial role in preventing an immune response. [[Transfer RNA and immune response | Transfer RNA]] is well-known for containing the most [[Nucleoside modifications and nonimmunogenic RNA | modified nucleosides]], suggesting these modifications might be responsible for their non-immunogenic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The next step in the research immediately became how to prove this by making RNA with specific [[Nucleoside modifications and nonimmunogenic RNA | nucleoside modifications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### General Observations

Most of the tested RNA, including synthetic RNA, did induce an immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. While RNA is naturally contained within cells in the body, it can elicit an [[mRNA and its inflammatory response | inflammatory reaction]] if it is released outside the cell due to injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

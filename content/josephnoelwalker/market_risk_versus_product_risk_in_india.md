In the United States, public goods are largely taken for granted, such as clean water, sidewalks, basic law enforcement, and efforts to mitigate air pollution [00:00:00]. This allows the private sector to focus on supplying other things, particularly within the digital space [00:00:23].

However, the situation is different in India. The private sector there often needs to build hardware design solutions that are assumed to be in place in the U.S. [00:00:36]. This fundamental difference impacts [[hardware_versus_software_investment_in_india | investment priorities]].

## Venture Capitalists' Misconceptions

Venture capitalists (VCs), both American and Indian, often misunderstand or fail to pick up opportunities in the hardware solution space in India [00:00:49]. This preference stems from the perceived risk profile:

*   **Software Investment:** For software, there is virtually no product risk. Young developers can create a solution in a few weeks, making market risk the primary concern [00:01:00]. This focus on product-to-market fit is a significant influence on VCs [00:02:15].
*   **Hardware Investment:** When it comes to hardware, VCs perceive both product risk and market risk [00:01:14]. However, this perception can be flawed. For products addressing clear needs, such as air pollution devices, there may be very little market risk due to existing demand [00:01:23]. The true challenge often lies in the high product risk associated with developing and manufacturing physical goods [00:01:31].

The [[venture_capitalists_risk_perception_in_product_development | VC world is heavily plugged into digital goods]], not physical, manufacturing-related goods, leading to a mismatch in understanding these opportunities [00:01:36].

## The Role of Angel Investors

Both American and [[angel_investors_versus_venture_capitalists_in_india | Indian VCs]] have a similar blind spot regarding hardware investments [00:01:51]. Indian VCs tend to mimic American VCs [00:01:55].

The individuals who are more adept at funding and de-risking these hardware solutions in India are [[angel_investors_versus_venture_capitalists_in_india | angel investors]] [00:01:57]. These angels often have prior experience building such products, understanding how to pool capital and de-risk product development [00:02:04]. Unlike VCs, who primarily focus on market risk and prefer to fund things with no real product risk, angels are equipped to navigate the complexities of product development [00:02:08].

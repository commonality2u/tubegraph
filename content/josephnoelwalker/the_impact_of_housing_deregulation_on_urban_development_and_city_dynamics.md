Bryan Caplan's book, *Build Baby Build: The Science and Ethics of Housing Regulation*, argues for the extensive deregulation of housing to address various societal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The book explores the potential consequences of such deregulation on urban environments and the broader economy.

## A Vision of Deregulated Urban Spaces

Full [[housing_deregulation_and_productivity | housing deregulation]] in the United States would significantly alter the urban and suburban landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Key changes would include:
*   **Downtowns and Skyscrapers**: Cities would see a dramatic increase in skyscrapers, as current regulations make building them difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. For example, San Francisco's strict regulations on historic sites and tearing down buildings severely limit vertical growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Suburban Transformation**: Suburbs, where approximately 80% of residential land is reserved for single-family homes, would experience a surge in multi-family housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This would allow more people to live in apartments in suburban areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Elimination of Minimum Lot Sizes**: Regulations requiring houses to be built on excessively large plots of land (e.g., one, two, or even five acres) would be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This would free up significant land for more housing units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Caplan suggests that rather than leading to mega-cities of 40 million people, deregulation would allow for more "leg room" everywhere, as construction would become more affordable and widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This could mean spacious, yet affordable, apartments in dense urban centers like Manhattan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Quantifying the Impact of [[Zoning regulations and their impact on housing supply | Zoning Regulations]]

Economists like Joe Gyourko and Ed Glaeser have pioneered methods to measure the impact of [[Zoning regulations and their impact on housing supply | zoning regulations]] on house prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Methodology**: Their approach involves comparing homes with similar characteristics but differing amounts of undeveloped land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. By observing how much people value marginal land (land that cannot be built on), they infer that pure land value is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. They then combine this with construction costs to estimate the total expense of a property, treating the difference between this and the market price as the "zoning tax" or regulatory burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Criticisms and Validation**: A common critique is that land parcels may be undervalued because they are indivisible or unusable for construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. However, Caplan notes that developers typically try to build as many properties as legally allowed on a given piece of land, suggesting that property owners do not highly value the "extra" land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Later work by Gyourko, using prices of actual vacant lots, yielded similar results, bolstering the method's soundness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:42]</a>.

## Housing Deregulation and Productivity Gains

[[Housing deregulation and productivity | Housing deregulation]] is seen as crucial for unlocking significant productivity gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Facilitating Internal Migration**: Just as immigration allows workers to move from low-productivity to high-productivity areas, internal migration within a country enables similar gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>. Historically, people in the US moved from low-wage areas (e.g., the rural South) to high-wage areas (e.g., California) for better economic opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.
*   **Impact of High Housing Costs**: Modern high housing costs in productive areas (like the Bay Area) hinder this mobility, especially for lower-skilled workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. These workers often find that the wage gains in high-productivity areas do not offset the exorbitant housing expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. Deregulating housing could restore this mobility, allowing workers of all skill levels to move to where their productivity and wages would be highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.
*   **Critiques of Productivity Gains**: Concerns are raised that new movers might "dilute" the talent pool or reduce the innovativeness of areas like the Bay Area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. However, Caplan argues that many low-skilled jobs exist in high-productivity areas, and the presence of more people, even lower-skilled ones, does not necessarily impede innovation, especially if it brings more high-skilled individuals to the core of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.
*   **Economic Models**: Economists use "Total Factor Productivity" (TFP) to account for qualitative differences like technology, managerial quality, and entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>. While models typically treat TFP as fixed, thoughtful critics question whether large-scale changes might impact it dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.

## Housing Affordability and Fertility Rates

Caplan posits that [[Policy solutions to address the housing crisis | housing unaffordability]] contributes to declining fertility rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>.
*   **Density vs. Price**: While some research links high density to reduced fertility (e.g., Tokyo, Seoul), Caplan argues that density is often conflated with high prices due to regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>. It is difficult to find cities that are both high-density and low-priced, making it hard to disentangle the effects of density from price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>.
*   **Suburban Housing and Fertility**: Deregulation leading to cheaper suburban housing, specifically larger single-family homes, is expected to directly increase fertility, as it provides more space and enables young adults to move out of their parents' homes sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:57:15]</a>.
*   **Cultural Factors**: Living with parents, a common trend in Southern and Eastern Europe, where fertility is lowest, can make it awkward to marry and have children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>. Reducing housing costs could enable earlier independence and potentially boost fertility rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>.
*   **Wealth vs. Affordability**: While societies generally become wealthier as fertility declines, housing is a unique sector where progress has been "strangled" by regulation, making it harder for younger generations to attain the same housing standards as their parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:52]</a>. This economic barrier, combined with cultural shifts towards "a life of play" and entertainment, contributes to lower fertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:42]</a>.

## Urban Aesthetics and the Built Environment

Concerns about the aesthetic impact of deregulation are often raised, but Caplan offers a counter-perspective:
*   **Imagining a Beautiful Future**: Critics often fear a "horrible cesspool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>, but Caplan suggests that a deregulated future could be "gorgeous" and "futuristic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:28]</a>. He uses a graphic novel format for *Build Baby Build* to visually present this alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a>.
*   **Historical Precedent**: Historically, major urban changes, initially opposed, have become beloved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>. For example, the Empire State Building replaced a "gorgeous" hotel, but most now appreciate the skyscraper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Bastiat's "What Is Seen and What Is Not Seen"**: Applying Frédéric Bastiat's concept, Caplan argues that people tend to focus on the visible (e.g., preserving a building) and ignore the unseen costs (e.g., lost housing, economic activity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:19:15]</a>. Current regulations, such as designating parking lots or vacant lots as "historic," exemplify this oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:18:28]</a>.

## [[Public perceptions and political challenges of housing deregulation | Public Perceptions and Political Challenges]]

Resistance to [[housing_deregulation_and_productivity | housing deregulation]] faces significant [[Public perceptions and political challenges of housing deregulation | public perceptions and political challenges]].
*   **Supply Skepticism**: Surveys in the US and Australia show a substantial portion of the population believes increased housing supply will cause prices to *rise*, not fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:50]</a>.
*   **Self-Interest vs. Philosophy**: Caplan argues that opposition is not primarily driven by homeowners' material self-interest (e.g., protecting property values). Instead, it stems from a philosophical belief that construction is "bad" or that deregulation will be detrimental to society in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:33">[01:22:50]</a>. People often come up with "public-interested" reasons for opposition, like concerns about traffic, shadows, or even disrupting migratory birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:19">[01:26:08]</a>.
*   **Political Dynamics**: While local opposition (NIMBYism) is common, state-level governments have begun to force localities to deregulate, especially in blue states like California, Oregon, and Minnesota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:39]</a>. This often occurs because elites in these states recognize the broader economic benefits despite local resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>.
*   **Federal Intervention**: Federal intervention has been minimal, but it could potentially be framed as a political move against blue states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:20]</a>.
*   **Partisan Coding**: Currently, the YIMBY (Yes In My Backyard) movement, advocating for deregulation, is largely bipartisan in effect (red states have lighter regulations by default, blue cities have activist movements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:18">[01:32:52]</a>. However, due to prominent left-wing activists, YIMBYism might become "left-coded" over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:15">[01:33:52]</a>.

## The Long View: Coruscant-Like Future?

Caplan suggests that in the very long run, human history might inevitably move towards a highly dense, Coruscant-like planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>. This is based on the idea that human fertility will eventually rebound due to evolutionary pressures, leading to continued population growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:02">[01:43:30]</a>. With limited other habitable planets at a reasonable cost, maximizing density on Earth, perhaps even by draining oceans for land, could be the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:50]</a>.

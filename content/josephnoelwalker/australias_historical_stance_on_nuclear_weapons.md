Australia has a complex and at times contradictory history regarding nuclear weapons, marked by periods of considering acquiring them, actively promoting non-proliferation, and more recently, decisions that have drawn criticism for potentially undermining its long-held disarmament principles.

## Early Ambivalence and the Nuclear Option (1960s-1970)

Despite its later reputation for strong disarmament efforts, Australia initially showed reluctance to fully commit to nuclear non-proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. From 1968 to 1970, under the Gorton government, Australia refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>. In fact, Australia was the second-last country to sign the treaty before it came into force in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:40">[03:40:40]</a>. The primary reason for this hesitation was to keep open the option of developing its own nuclear arsenal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

During this period, significant internal debate occurred within the Australian government about acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:58">[04:13:58]</a>. Sir Philip Baxter, Chairman of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, was a key proponent of Australia developing nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:15">[05:00:15]</a>. Baxter, who had worked on the Manhattan Project, influenced Prime Minister John Gorton with the idea of building a reactor at Jervis Bay to produce weapons-grade fissile material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. Baxter's view was that "white folk" had a right to develop necessary weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. The decision to join the NPT was "line ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>, with strong influence from Baxter and others within the bureaucracy pushing for Australia to become a nuclear-weapon state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.

Upon signing, Australia expressed reservations, becoming one of the only states to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. These "weasel words" allowed for potential withdrawal in "extremis" if supreme national interests justified it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. John Gorton was deeply concerned about giving up the nuclear option for 25 years, citing an inability to rely on the United States for nuclear weapons under ANZUS in the event of nuclear blackmail or attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.

## Active Disarmament and Non-Proliferation (1980s-1990s)

A significant shift occurred in the 1980s. In 1983, the Australian government appointed its first Ambassador for Disarmament, Richard Butler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:05">[49:05]</a>. At the time, there was only one other such ambassador in the world, from Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This appointment, made by Foreign Minister Bill Hayden, signaled Australia's commitment to leading disarmament negotiations globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27">[50:27]</a>. This move sent a "ripple through the international community" and other countries soon followed Australia's lead in appointing dedicated disarmament ambassadors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:54">[56:54]</a>.

Australia played a crucial role in nuclear non-proliferation efforts, notably:
*   **NPT Extension (1995):** Richard Butler, then Australia's Ambassador to the UN, played a pivotal role in the indefinite extension of the NPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. The NPT's future was uncertain because non-nuclear weapon states felt that nuclear weapon states had not upheld their bargain to disarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>. Butler devised a solution: a supplementary package of politically binding documents, including a commitment to a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. This proposal, hashed out during a late-night dinner hosted by Butler, secured the NPT's indefinite extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (1996):** Butler also engineered the passage of the CTBT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. When India blocked the treaty's transfer from the Conference on Disarmament to the UN General Assembly due to a consensus rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:00">[39:53:00]</a>, Butler bypassed this by tabling the identical text directly in the General Assembly under Australia's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:57:00">[42:57:00]</a>. This "Homeric trick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:09:00">[37:09:00]</a> led to the overwhelming adoption of the CTBT text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:01:00">[46:01:00]</a>.

### Uranium Mining and Nuclear Facilities
The debate around uranium mining in Australia was also significant. In the 1970s, the Labor Party debated whether to "leave our uranium in the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:59:00">[39:59:00]</a>. Bill Hayden and Richard Butler devised a policy that allowed for uranium sales, provided it was only sold to countries committed to peaceful nuclear energy and with no connection to nuclear weapons programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:09:00">[40:09:00]</a>. This policy was supported by a strong commitment to disarmament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:08:00">[41:08:00]</a>.

Concerns about US joint facilities in Australia, such as Pine Gap, have also been long-standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:08:00">[38:08:00]</a>. In the 1980s, Bill Hayden strategically argued that these facilities were crucial for disarmament purposes, specifically for monitoring and verifying missile launchers globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:31:00">[38:31:00]</a>. This argument helped to neutralize opposition from elements within the Labor Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46:00">[38:46:00]</a>.

### The Canberra Commission (1996)
In 1996, Prime Minister Paul Keating initiated the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:25">[02:07:25]</a>. Chaired by Richard Butler, this group of eminent experts developed a practical program for nuclear weapons elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:40">[02:08:40]</a>. The commission articulated a core syllogism:
1.  As long as nuclear weapons exist, other states will seek to acquire them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:47">[02:11:47]</a>.
2.  As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will one day be used, by accident or design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:56">[02:11:56]</a>.
3.  Any such use would be catastrophic for the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:01">[02:12:01]</a>.

This report remains influential, and a new commission was announced in 2024 by Harvard and the Carnegie Foundation to reinvigorate nuclear disarmament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:28">[02:09:28]</a>.

## Contemporary Challenges and the AUKUS Agreement

More recently, Australia's approach to nuclear issues has drawn criticism. The [[implications_of_the_aukus_agreement_on_nuclear_power | AUKUS agreement]], which involves Australia acquiring nuclear-powered submarines, has been called the "worst foreign policy and national security decision our country has ever taken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Critics argue that this agreement risks making Australia a "military colony of the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, potentially undermining its independent foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:03">[02:25:03]</a>.

There are concerns that countries now perceive Australia as merely an extension or "semi-colony" of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. The belief that the US will defend Australia with nuclear weapons against China in a nuclear exchange is seen as an illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:29">[02:27:29]</a>. The expansion of US bases in Australia, including airfields where nuclear-capable B-52 bombers land, is also viewed as contrary to Australia's obligations under the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:53">[02:47:53]</a>.

Despite its past successes in multilateral diplomacy and its historical role as a "good international citizen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, concerns exist that Australia's current stance, particularly concerning AUKUS, is harming its credibility as a middle power attached to principles of international law and good conduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. The long-standing debate about relying on a nuclear weapon state for protection, as articulated by John Gorton in 1968, remains a central theme in [[australias_defense_strategy_and_autonomy | Australia's defense strategy and autonomy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

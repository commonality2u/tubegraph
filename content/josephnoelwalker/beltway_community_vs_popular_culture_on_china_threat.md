The current intellectual and cultural environment in the U.S. does not suggest that the nation is prepared for a significant contest with China, particularly when contrasting the views within the "Beltway" community with broader popular culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

## Disconnect on the China Challenge

There is a noticeable difference in the level of engagement and concern regarding the [[american_political_stance_on_chinas_rise | China challenge]] between the foreign policy establishment and the general American public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

### Beltway Focus
Within the "Beltway" community, there is considerable focus on China:
*   American scholars, think tankers, political advisors, and military analysts have produced numerous books about China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:51">[01:48:51]</a>.
*   *Foreign Affairs*, a journal central to the American foreign policy establishment, is "chalk full of articles" discussing the China Challenge and threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:02">[02:00:02]</a>.
*   The "governing class in America" claims to be embarking upon a challenge of significant scale against China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:08">[03:06:08]</a>.

### Lack of Popular Engagement
In contrast, this pervasive concern is not widely reflected in American popular culture or general intellectual discourse beyond Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:44">[01:30:44]</a>:
*   Popular commentators, such as Joe Rogan, are not observed to be "obsessed with China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>.
*   Mainstream writers like David Brooks and Ross Douthat are not writing books about the China Challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:20">[02:13:20]</a>.
*   The overall [[us_intellectual_and_cultural_readiness_for_china_challenge | intellectual ferment]] needed to support the declared scale of the challenge is currently absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:19">[03:00:19]</a>.

## Historical Comparisons

The current situation does not resemble past national efforts or periods of intense public engagement with major threats:
*   **[[comparison_of_china_challenge_to_cold_war | Cold War]]**: During the [[comparison_of_china_challenge_to_cold_war | Cold War]], "Cold War liberalism" emerged as an entire school of thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:46">[02:24:46]</a>.
*   **War on Terrorism**: Figures such as Andrew Sullivan, Christopher Hitchens, Paul Berman, and Michael Ignatieff, along with *The New York Times* editorial page, were all "obsessed" with the question of maintaining liberal democracy in the face of the radical Islamist threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:04">[02:36:04]</a>. This level of broad engagement is currently not seen concerning China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

> [!info] The China Challenge
> The challenge posed by China is considered economically "much bigger" than the [[comparison_of_china_challenge_to_cold_war | Cold War]], and already a greater economic challenge than Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. China has also surpassed 60% of American GDP, a figure no other power has previously approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## The Need for a "Whole of Nation" Effort

Addressing the [[american_political_stance_on_chinas_rise | China challenge]] requires a "whole of nation effort," which is even bigger than the [[comparison_of_china_challenge_to_cold_war | Cold War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. This type of widespread national commitment cannot be achieved quietly or as solely a "Beltway project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. It necessitates an [[role_of_american_presidents_in_addressing_china | American president]] to publicly declare it a "national mission" and rally the country to devote itself to this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. However, no [[role_of_american_presidents_in_addressing_china | American president]] since China's rise as a great power in the early post-[[comparison_of_china_challenge_to_cold_war | Cold War]] years has done so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

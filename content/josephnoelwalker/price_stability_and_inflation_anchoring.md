Maintaining price stability through inflation anchoring is a key objective for [[central_banks_and_2_inflation_target | central banks]]. The commonly accepted 2% inflation target, similar to the Basel Capital requirements, was initially set as a "reasonable thing" that was neither too close to zero nor excessively high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Why a Low Inflation Target?

A 2% inflation level is designed to be noticeable but generally not a concern for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Studies indicate that inflation typically becomes a significant problem only when it reaches double digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The primary goal of a low inflation target is to prevent inflation from "getting a life of its own" and escalating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

A stable, low inflation rate ensures that price movements are relative rather than absolute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This means that if the price of oil increases, it causes relative price movements rather than leading to generalized inflation across the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The objective is to establish an inflation level low enough that "nobody really cares too much about it," which helps to anchor expectations around that target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Arbitrary Nature and Consistency

While the specific number for an inflation target, such as 2%, might appear arbitrarily chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, its exact value is less critical than its consistency and whether it is kept low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The more important factor is that the target is consistently met and remains "below the radar screen of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_changing_inflation_targets | Challenges of Changing Inflation Targets]]

There is "never a good time" to adjust an inflation target, such as raising it from 2% to 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   If inflation is currently high, changing the target can be perceived as an admission of defeat, suggesting that the central bank cannot return inflation to the original target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   Conversely, if inflation is at or below target, advocating for a higher target seems illogical, especially when the challenge is to *increase* inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Prior to the pandemic, for example, the Federal Reserve faced the issue of persistently low inflation, averaging about 1.2% over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. At that time, calls to increase the target to 4% were dismissed as "ridiculous" because the central bank was struggling to even reach its 2% goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Instead, the Fed opted to modify its framework to be more accommodating of inflation, rather than changing the target itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

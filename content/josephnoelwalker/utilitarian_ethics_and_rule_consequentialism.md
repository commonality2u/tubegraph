Utilitarian ethics, in its various forms, fundamentally asks individuals to maximize a given outcome subject to certain constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This ethical framework explores how to make decisions that lead to the best possible results.

## Core Concepts

### The Value of Life and Future Generations
A fundamental presupposition for doing anything, including ethical reasoning, is that some form of life has positive value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While an economist might ask if particular individuals should commit suicide, to obliterate all life is considered "as close to self-evidently wrong as we can find a proposition in ethics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

Caring about the [[the_value_of_life_and_existential_risk | distant future]] is critical because it will be inhabited by a large number of people whose pleasures and sufferings will be no less real than those in the present, regardless of their distance in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Just as geographic distance does not diminish a person's worth, temporal distance should not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Social Discount Rates
The appropriate social discount rate depends on what is being discounted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Cash Flows**: A positive discount rate is appropriate for cash flows due to the opportunity cost of investing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Happiness, Utility, or Well-being**: There should be no discount rate across either short or long time horizons when considering these concepts, ensuring consistency across choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

A common issue in decision-making is a "fixation on the very soon" rather than a significant difference in how people discount 10 years versus 200 or 500 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. While caring about the [[the_value_of_life_and_existential_risk | distant future]] may not come naturally to most, some individuals and cultures (e.g., those with high savings rates) successfully prioritize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Rule Consequentialism
The distinction between rule utilitarianism and act utilitarianism lies in how they specify constraints for maximizing outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Societies that adopt a "rule consequentialist frame of mind" tend to perform significantly better on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

**Recommended Readings:**
*   Brad Hooker's *Ideal Code, Real World* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>
*   Works by earlier philosophers such as Butler, Mill, Sidgwick, and Barfit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
*   Donald Reagan's *Cooperation and Utilitarianism* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>

It is suggested that for many philosophical questions, a better understanding can be gained from classics rather than the latest specialized journal articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges in Consequentialism

### Moral Paralysis and Uncertainty
Decision-making should not be paralyzed by uncertainty, as "doing nothing is just as much a decision as quote-unquote doing something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. The approach recommended is to pursue maximum expected value and avoid "moral nervousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This involves adopting a "builder" mentality, focusing on doing one's best and moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Epistemic Critique
The epistemic critique of consequentialism argues that we cannot know all outcomes to maximize utility. However, it is argued that one typically has "some idea what is the better course of action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Despite wide uncertainty about the ultimate future, individuals can still take actions with clear positive immediate effects, such as saving a child from an oncoming car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The philosophy is to "be a builder" and act on the best available knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Charitable Giving and Direct Aid
When considering charitable giving, direct cash transfers to individuals can be highly efficient due to minimal overhead, compared to established charities which incur administrative costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This highlights a practical application of maximizing impact in a more direct manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

## Radical Uncertainty and Policy

Radical uncertainty should encourage greater tolerance for differing policy prescriptions and less certainty in one's own tribal views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. Even if one believes their view is marginally more likely to be correct, the overall low probability of any single view being perfectly right should foster humility and a "Bayesian" approach to comparing probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. This aligns with [[debates_in_behavioral_economics | behavioral economics]] discussions on cognitive biases and decision-making under uncertainty.

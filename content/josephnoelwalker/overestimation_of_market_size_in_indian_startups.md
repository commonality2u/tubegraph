Western venture capitalists often [[impact_of_misconceptions_on_investments_in_indian_tech_sector | overestimate the size of the market]] for Indian startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This misconception stems from a fundamental difference in how India's digital revolution unfolded compared to developed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## India's "Upside Down" Digital Revolution

Unlike developed nations where digital adoption followed high GDP per capita and widespread infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, India's digital revolution is "upside down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. In parts of India, such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, excellent internet access is available even in impoverished areas that may lack basic amenities like water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This has led to a significant [[indias_digital_revolution_contrast_with_developed_countries | discrepancy between digital access and disposable income in India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## The True Addressable Market

Commonly cited figures suggest India has 860 million people plugged into the digital space via smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This often leads to overestimations of market potential, for instance, an edtech company might mistakenly project a market size of 300 million young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

However, the number of Indians with comparable digital engagement and disposable income to consumers in the US is only about 25-30 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. These are the individuals who can afford services like Netflix or Amazon subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Sajit Pai's "Indus Valley Report" offers a more precise [[analysis_of_the_true_addressable_market_for_western_vcs_in_india | analysis of the true addressable market for Western VCs in India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The report estimates that "India A," the segment of the population with significant spending on internet services, is roughly the size of Taiwan, approximately 200 million people, possibly even fewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The "next billion" people do not spend much money on these kinds of digital services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Implications for Venture Capital

Venture capitalists often seek to replicate successful Western business models like DoorDash or Uber in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. They incorrectly assume that India's large smartphone user base (860 million) translates directly into a market comparable to, for example, California's millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. In reality, investors are often investing in a market segment that is smaller and poorer than California, comparable only to the "Taiwan that lives in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Western venture capitalists (VCs) frequently [[misinterpretation_of_indias_total_addressable_market_by_foreign_investors | overestimate the size of the market]] in India when considering investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This often leads to an inaccurate assessment of potential returns, as the widely cited figures for digital connectivity do not accurately reflect the market's true purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## India's Unique Digital Revolution

Unlike the developed world, where the digital revolution occurred after a certain GDP per capita allowed widespread phone ownership and infrastructure development, [[indias_unique_digital_revolution_compared_to_the_developed_world | India's digital revolution]] has taken place "upside down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. In parts of India, such as Varanasi and the poorest areas of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, there is excellent internet connectivity, even when basic amenities like water might be lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Misconceptions About Market Scale

Commonly, figures suggest that India has 860 million people plugged into the digital space through smartphones, with at least one per household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Additionally, India is noted for having the largest number of young people, leading some to believe an edtech company could have a potential market size of 300 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. However, these numbers represent a significant overestimation of the truly addressable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Actual Addressable Market

The number of people in India who have internet access comparable to users in the US, with similar disposable income, is estimated to be only about 25 to 30 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. These are the consumers who subscribe to services like Netflix or Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

According to Sajit Pai's "Indus Valley Report," the true "India A" (as he calls it, comparing it to Silicon Valley) is roughly the size of Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The group that engages in significant online spending is estimated to be around 200 million, or even slightly less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The "next billion" people in India do not spend substantial amounts of money on digital goods and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Western VC Misinterpretations

Western VCs often look to [[challenges_in_replicating_western_business_models_in_india | replicate Western business models]] like DoorDash or Uber for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. They incorrectly assume that since California has millions of people and India has 860 million smartphone users, a one-on-one translation of market potential exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. In reality, VCs are primarily investing in "the Taiwan that lives in India," which is a market both smaller and poorer than California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This fundamental misunderstanding is a critical error in their investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Australia's voting system stands out among English-speaking democracies for its use of preferential voting, where voters rank candidates in order of preference [00:00:20]. This system, along with [[the_role_of_compulsory_voting_in_australia | compulsory voting]], contributes to Australia's unique electoral landscape [00:00:44].

## Early Intentions and Delayed Adoption
When the Commonwealth of Australia was formed, the Barton government initially proposed a system that included preferential voting for the House of Representatives and a form of proportional representation for the Senate in the 1902 Electoral Act [00:24:01]. However, these proposals were not immediately implemented. Instead, Australia used first-past-the-post voting for the House of Representatives until 1918, and block voting for the Senate until 1948 [00:24:18]. It was only in 1948 that Australia finally adopted the voting systems for both houses that were originally intended shortly after Federation [00:24:29].

## Preferential Voting and Australia's Political Culture
Preferential voting is considered a significant element of Australia's [[historical_and_cultural_roots_of_australian_egalitarianism | majoritarian political culture]] [00:23:51]. The Barton government's initial interest in preferential voting stemmed from the three-way split in Parliament during the Commonwealth's first decade, with anticipated conflicts between free traders and protectionists, alongside the emerging Labor Party [00:25:17], [00:25:32].

The Labor Party, which was a "new kid on the block" [00:26:15], gained significant power, winning 24 seats in the first Commonwealth Parliament and increasing their majorities to form a majority government by 1910 [00:26:26]. If preferential voting had been adopted in 1902, the Liberal-leaning Deakinite Liberals might have benefited from Labor's preferences, potentially strengthening the political "center" and altering Labor's trajectory as a dominant political force [00:27:14], [00:27:34].

## Reasons for Adoption
The eventual adoption of preferential voting in 1918 for the House of Representatives was largely driven by pragmatic political reasons [00:27:28]. Farmers' organizations, concerned about splitting the non-Labor vote in three-cornered contests and inadvertently allowing Labor representatives to win, successfully pressured the Nationalist government of Stanley Melbourne Bruce to introduce the system [00:47:40].

## Impact and Flexibility
Preferential voting, especially when combined with proportional representation in the Senate, has had a profound impact on the Australian political system. It has enabled specific interest groups to gain representation and exert political pressure [00:48:13]. Examples include the Democratic Labor Party (DLP), Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, and the recent rise of Independents (such as the 'Teals') [00:48:25].

This system provides a degree of flexibility, allowing diverse voices to stay engaged within the political system rather than becoming marginalized [00:49:05]. It helps address the challenge of how minority interests are represented in a [[historical_and_cultural_roots_of_australian_egalitarianism | majoritarian democracy]], preventing them from being "smothered" [00:49:25].

In contemporary Australia, society is increasingly complex socially and demographically [00:49:40]. The preferential voting system allows for the accommodation of this complexity, fostering more nuanced political outcomes [00:49:57]. This system, in conjunction with the proportional representation in the Senate, means that no single government has controlled the Senate since the early 1980s, necessitating negotiation with a range of crossbench members on legislation [00:50:27]. This ongoing negotiation process, if it extends to the lower house with the rise of Independents, may not be a radical shift from existing parliamentary dynamics [00:50:51].

The trend of House of Representatives seats being decided by preferences has also significantly increased, with 102 out of 150 seats reliant on second preferences by the 2016 election [01:15:00], [00:51:32]. This highlights the increasing importance of preference flows and deals in Australian elections [01:15:00].

The [[nuclear_nonproliferation_and_its_historical_context | Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty]] (NPT) is widely regarded as the cornerstone of [[nuclear_nonproliferation_and_its_historical_context | nuclear arms control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. Introduced following grave concerns about [[nuclear_proliferation and its implications | nuclear proliferation]] in the 1960s, the NPT has been instrumental in limiting the number of nuclear weapons states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Historical Context and Origins

In the 1960s, there were widespread predictions, including by then-President John F. Kennedy, that within a generation, there would be dozens of nuclear states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Yet, as of 2023, only nine states possess nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This relative success in [[nuclear_nonproliferation_and_its_historical_context | nuclear nonproliferation]] is attributed to several factors, particularly the NPT itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The NPT's origins are directly linked to the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, which brought the world "so close to blowing up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Correspondence between Kennedy and Khrushchev after the crisis quickly led to the decision that "some kind of treaty had to be set up to prevent that [[nuclear_proliferation and its implications | proliferation]] from coming along" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The NPT was finally tabled in 1968 and took effect in 1970 after being signed by sufficient parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The NPT's Core Bargain

The NPT established a fundamental bargain between nuclear-weapon states (NWS) and non-nuclear-weapon states (NNWS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>:
*   **For NNWS**: A promise that if they did not go nuclear, they would receive support from the major powers for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **For NWS**: A promise that the nuclear powers would work towards universal [[the_future_of_nuclear_disarmament_and_global_security_concerns | nuclear disarmament]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, leading to a world with no nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

This bargain was intended to involve "continuous and simultaneous" actions by both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

### Unfulfilled Promise

A significant challenge to the NPT has been the unkept promise by nuclear powers to pursue [[the_future_of_nuclear_disarmament_and_global_security_concerns | nuclear disarmament]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. As of today, serious progress towards the elimination of existing stockpiles has not been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, leading to restlessness among non-nuclear signatories who nearly abrogated the treaty in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Australia's Initial Reluctance

Despite Australia's later storied efforts in the cause of eliminating nuclear weapons, the country initially refused to sign the NPT for two years under the Gorton government (1968-1970) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Australia was the second-last country to sign the treaty before it came into force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

The primary reason for this delay was to keep open the option of [[prerequisites_for_australia_to_consider_acquiring_nuclear_weapons | developing its own nuclear arsenal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Sir Philip Baxter, Chairman of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and a former Manhattan Project scientist, was a strong advocate for Australia acquiring nuclear weapons, believing "white folk have a right to... develop the weapons that we need to keep the hordes away from harming us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Baxter gained the ear of Prime Minister John Gorton, proposing a reactor at Jervis Bay to produce weapons-grade fissile material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This debate was "line ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, with strong influence from Baxter and other parts of the bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

John Gorton was "deeply concerned about giving up the nuclear option for a period as long as 25 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, and felt Australia could not rely on the United States for nuclear weapons under ANZUS in the event of [[implications_of_nuclear_blackmail_and_deterrence_by_countries_like_china | nuclear blackmail]] or attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This stance caught negative international attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. When Australia did sign, it did so with reservations, expressing that it might withdraw in "extremist" circumstances if supreme national interests justified it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## The 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference

The NPT was initially given a lifespan of 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, necessitating a review and extension conference in New York in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This was considered the only opportunity to permanently extend the NPT, as subsequent votes would require new ratification by a majority of member states, which was deemed impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The US, in particular, placed immense importance on the treaty not lapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

The core challenge for extension was the non-nuclear weapon states' perception that the nuclear weapon states had not upheld their bargain regarding [[the_future_of_nuclear_disarmament_and_global_security_concerns | nuclear disarmament]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Egypt, for instance, was "absolutely resolute" that there would be no extension unless the bargain showed real progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

### Richard Butler's Role

Australian diplomat Richard Butler played a crucial role in securing the indefinite extension of the NPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. As Australia's Ambassador to the UN, he devised a solution: proposing a separate, supplementary set of politically binding documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. These documents prescribed better behavior from nuclear weapon states regarding [[the_future_of_nuclear_disarmament_and_global_security_concerns | disarmament]] and elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Key commitments included:
*   A fissile materials cut-off treaty (stopping production of weapons-grade material) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   A recommitment to the NPT's Article 6 obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   Crucially, a commitment to a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) by 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

This "political commitment" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a> allowed for the NPT's extension by enabling states to accept the "best intentions" of nuclear powers while the fundamental bargain was still pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. The final deal was largely forged during a late-night dinner at Butler's New York residence, attended by representatives from key opinion groups, including Egypt and non-aligned countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. The agreement was adopted the next day by the conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

## Impact and Success of the NPT

The NPT has been "absolutely fundamental" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a> in establishing a global norm against [[nuclear_proliferation and its implications | nuclear proliferation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. It is viewed as a "charter commitment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>, providing a legal framework for humanity's rejection of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

### Containment of Proliferation

The most significant success of the NPT is that "no one has proliferated" except for a handful of states that are not members of the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. The nine nuclear weapons states today consist of:
1.  **The five NWS defined by the treaty (pre-1967 nuclear tests)**: USA, Russia (Soviet Union), UK, France, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
2.  **Four non-signatories**: India, Israel, Pakistan, and North Korea (which withdrew from the NPT in 2003) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

Countries like Sweden and Argentina and Brazil had embarked on significant nuclear weapons programs before the NPT, but subsequently joined the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. South Africa also developed nuclear weapons, but dismantled its program and joined the NPT as part of ending apartheid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>. This demonstrates the NPT's effectiveness in holding the line against wider [[nuclear_proliferation and its implications | proliferation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.

### Link to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)

The CTBT is a critical component of [[nuclear_nonproliferation_and_its_historical_context | nonproliferation]] because a proliferator, as a "new entry to the possession of nuclear weapons," needs to test to ensure their weapon works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>.

At the 1996 CTBT negotiations in Geneva, India blocked the treaty from being sent to the UN General Assembly due to a consensus rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. Richard Butler bypassed this by tabling an identical treaty text in the name of Australia directly to the General Assembly, where it was adopted overwhelmingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. This "Homeric trick" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:02">[02:01:02]</a> ensured the CTBT moved forward and kept the "bargain deal" of the NPT extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.

Although the CTBT has not yet legally entered into force due to stringent ratification requirements (44 specified states), it is being "acted upon as if it has" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:29">[01:12:29]</a>. The maxim "Thou shalt not test" is overwhelmingly supported and adhered to by the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>. The CTBT also established an impressive International Monitoring System, primarily a seismological network that registers tremors to detect underground explosions and discriminate them from earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:05">[01:37:05]</a>.

## Future of Disarmament and Deterrence

The question of whether the window on [[the_future_of_nuclear_disarmament_and_global_security_concerns | disarmament]] has closed in the 21st century remains open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:16">[02:17:16]</a>. Current rhetoric, such as President Putin's threats regarding tactical nuclear weapons use, is "deeply disturbing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

### The Canberra Commission's Axiom

In 1996, the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, chaired by Richard Butler, articulated a fundamental axiom still relevant today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:09">[02:10:09]</a>:
1.  As long as nuclear weapons exist, they will one day be used, by accident or design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:17">[02:10:17]</a>.
2.  Any use would be absolutely devastating to the whole world, from which recovery is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:24">[02:10:24]</a>.
3.  The only safe thing to do with nuclear weapons is to eliminate them, seeing them onto a museum shelf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:36">[02:10:36]</a>.

The means to achieve elimination are well-known, including treaties like the CTBT and a cut-off treaty for fissile material production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:48">[02:10:48]</a>. The core syllogism is: if nuclear weapons exist, other states will seek to acquire them; if they exist, they will eventually be used; and any use would be catastrophic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:05">[02:12:05]</a>.

### Challenges to Nonproliferation

Some worry about potential future breakouts from countries like Japan, South Korea, or Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:29">[02:18:29]</a>. While Japan has an interest, its history makes it difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:32">[02:18:32]</a>. Other candidates might be European states feeling threatened by Russia, such as Germany, or even Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:31">[02:20:31]</a>.

The concept of "minimal [[implications_of_nuclear_blackmail_and_deterrence_by_countries_like_china | nuclear deterrence]]" is seen as "BS" and "nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:16">[02:11:16]</a>; once the nuclear line is crossed, states in possession of nuclear weapons are likely to escalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:25">[02:11:25]</a>.

For Australia, the idea of [[prerequisites_for_australia_to_consider_acquiring_nuclear_weapons | acquiring nuclear weapons]] if it felt it could no longer rely on America's policy of [[challenges_related_to_extended_nuclear_deterrence_and_us_alliances | extended nuclear deterrence]] or if regional neighbors developed them is rejected as "not justified" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:33">[02:21:33]</a>. [[implications_of_nuclear_blackmail_and_deterrence_by_countries_like_china | Nuclear deterrence]] is considered an illusion, and acquiring such weapons would only incentivize further [[nuclear_proliferation and its implications | proliferation]] or a first strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:31">[02:22:31]</a>.

There appears to be a general complacency about [[nuclear_proliferation and its implications | proliferation]] today, possibly due to "other fish to fry" such as climate change and food supply, leading to a calculation that major nuclear powers will manage their own weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:18">[02:25:18]</a>.

The NPT, despite its flaws, remains crucial. It reinforces the global norm that "no one should have nuclear weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:11">[02:18:11]</a>.

Western venture capitalists (VCs) and investors often [[overestimation_of_the_indian_market_size_by_western_vcs | overestimate the size of the Indian market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, leading to difficulties in replicating business models successful in the West. This challenge stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of India's unique economic and digital landscape.

## India's Unique Digital Revolution

[[indias_unique_digital_revolution_compared_to_the_developed_world | India's digital revolution has occurred in an "upside down" manner]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> compared to developed nations. In the developed world, digital adoption followed significant GDP per capita growth, enabling widespread affordability of phones and internet infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, in India, even in impoverished areas like parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, excellent internet connectivity exists, sometimes coexisting with a lack of basic amenities like water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Misinterpretation of the Total Addressable Market

Commonly cited figures suggest India has 860 million people connected to the digital space via smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, often leading to the assumption of a vast market for digital services. For instance, an edtech company might assume a potential market of 300 million young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. However, this is considered a significant [[misinterpretation_of_indias_total_addressable_market_by_foreign_investors | overestimation of India's total addressable market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The reality is that the segment of the Indian population with comparable [[differences_in_disposable_income_and_digital_consumption_in_india | disposable income]] and digital consumption habits to typical users in the US is only about 25-30 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. These are the individuals who subscribe to services like Netflix or Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### The "Indus Valley" Report

Sajit Pai's "Indus Valley Report" sheds light on this disparity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. He estimates that the "India A" market, which represents the segment with significant spending power on internet services, is roughly the size of Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This group, which spends a considerable amount online, is estimated to be around 200 million people, possibly even less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The "next billion" users do not spend comparably on these types of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Implication for Western Models

VCs often aim to replicate Western successes like DoorDash or Uber in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, assuming that India's large smartphone user base (860 million) is directly comparable to a market like California (millions of people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This is a flawed assumption. The actual "addressable market" for such ventures is significantly smaller and poorer than the typical Western market they are used to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Investors are, in effect, investing in the "Taiwan that lives in India," which is smaller and less affluent than California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

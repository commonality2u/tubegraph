The preparation process for highly competent podcast interviews involves an "extremely unusual process" of intensive study, likened to being an "athlete of learning" [00:00:47]. This approach emphasizes deep, focused learning motivated by a concrete goal: conducting an interview with great excellence [00:03:40], [00:03:44].

## Defining Intensive Study

For a single interview, such as the one with Nassim Nicholas Taleb (TB), preparation can span hundreds of hours [00:03:10]:

*   **Non-Intensive Prep** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>:
    *   Working with a private tutor through textbooks (e.g., probability and statistics) for about two months, often 5 hours every Saturday [00:01:16], totaling around 40 hours [00:02:10], [00:02:14].
    *   Completing a Real World Risk Institute course, which involved 5 hours every night for two weeks (50 hours) [00:01:31], [00:02:04].
    *   Long-term engagement with the guest's work, stretching back eight years as an interested reader [00:02:20].
    *   Total non-intensive prep can reach approximately 90 hours [00:02:16].
*   **Intensive Prep** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>:
    *   One to three weeks immediately before the interview [00:02:28].
    *   8 to 14 hours per day of reading relevant material, note-taking, and practicing spaced repetition memory prompts [00:02:30].
    *   For the TB interview, this phase alone accounted for about 9 days, adding another 100 hours [00:03:00], [00:03:04].

This totals approximately 200 hours of focused learning for a single interview [00:03:10]. The process is highly motivated by the specific conversation, aiming for a deep engagement with the guest's ideas [00:03:39].

## The Orientation and Prioritization Process

With a fixed amount of time (e.g., 200 hours), significant satisficing is required when facing an "enormous pile of material" [00:04:21]. The process involves constant prioritization and an evolving reading list [00:14:20], [00:15:01].

### Syllabus and Expert Consultation
Initial steps involve consulting experts to build a foundational syllabus:
*   Speaking with friends who are professors of statistics or work in finance to advise on core texts and topics [00:05:20].
*   Communicating time constraints (e.g., "two months to get to a pretty decent undergraduate understanding of probability and statistics") [00:05:53].
*   The goal is to furnish oneself with sufficient context for the interview and the guest's body of work [00:06:09].
*   Direct guidance from the interviewee themselves, if possible, is invaluable for identifying the "most important stuff" [00:21:37], [00:22:14].

### Selecting Material for Study
When given textbooks, further consultation helps narrow the focus:
*   Asking which are the "most important parts," chapters, or topics to focus on [00:07:07].
*   Identifying what can be omitted given time constraints [00:07:17].
*   The reading list remains fluid and adapts daily as more context is gained [00:15:01], reflecting the principle that a "serious plan" cannot be made too far in advance [00:15:17].

## Learning Strategies and Tools

### Guided Problem Solving
Working with a tutor is a crucial component, especially for mastering technical fields.
*   The relationship can be peer-like, with both individuals reading texts independently [00:08:10], [00:08:28].
*   Sessions involve solving practice problems together on a whiteboard [00:08:37].
*   The tutor can provide "mini lessons" for foundational knowledge gaps, a process known as [[challenges_of_mastering_new_fields_quickly | prerequisite chaining]] [00:10:09], [00:10:32]. This prevents floundering online and leverages the tutor's immediate expertise [00:10:39].

### Just-in-Time Learning
When encountering difficult or unfamiliar concepts during reading, "just-in-time learning" is employed [00:12:55].
*   Quick look-ups using Google or large language models (LLMs) for definitions or concept clarification [00:13:09].
*   Messaging friends or experts for more nuanced or complex questions, especially when one's own question might be "ill posed" [00:13:19]. The general rule is to look it up first to avoid wasting others' time [00:13:27].

### Note-Taking and Knowledge Capture
A multi-faceted approach to note-taking supports the learning process:
*   **Handwritten Notes:** Used during tutoring sessions [00:11:16], particularly for mathematical work to allow for drawing and freeform problem-solving [01:01:44].
*   **Digital Notes (Obsidian):**
    *   **"Mega Note":** A long-standing, often messy note accumulating thoughts, vague ideas for questions, links to interviews, critiques, and other sources related to a guest. These can be years old, reflecting "wish list" guests [00:16:36], [01:16:55].
    *   **Per-Book Notes:** Specific notes for each book read, containing personal commentary and excerpts [00:38:15].
    *   **Excerpts:** Important "neat distillations of an important idea" are extracted, serving as a resource for later review [00:40:44], [00:40:48].
    *   **LLM Integration:** A digital version of the book (PDF) is often open simultaneously in an LLM wrapper (e.g., AI Drive), allowing for immediate querying of technical explanations or concepts by page number [00:32:37], [00:34:41].
*   **Physical Book Tags:** Used to mark sections for later conversion into memory prompts or for extracting excerpts, avoiding interruption of reading flow [00:36:55], [00:41:12].

### Spaced Repetition and Memory Prompts
[[tools_for_learning_and_memory | Spaced repetition]] is a core element, providing immediate feedback and long-term knowledge retention:
*   Memory prompts are created *after* reading a chapter or section, based on marked passages [00:41:05]. This allows for a more refined selection of concepts, as earlier ideas might be superseded by clearer explanations later in the chapter [00:41:21].
*   Prompts are typically stored at the bottom of the digital note in Obsidian, then pushed to a spaced repetition software like Mochi [00:43:16], [00:55:09].
*   **Benefits of Spaced Repetition:**
    *   **Compounding Knowledge:** Information retention from prompts makes subsequent study days easier and allows for leveraging prompts created for past interviews in future ones [00:48:11], [00:47:05].
    *   **Immediate Feedback Loop:** Reviewing prompts daily, especially during intensive sprints, provides a "shorter feedback cycle" for understanding, making the "tedious, lonely, difficult process" of solo research more rewarding and motivating [00:49:32], [00:50:09]. It creates a visible "output" of progress [00:50:29].
    *   **Humbling Check:** The humbling experience of not being able to recall information from prompts created just hours before increases confidence in the practice's utility [00:49:00].
*   **Prompt Writing Principles:**
    *   Have "empathy for your future self" [00:51:26].
    *   Ensure prompts are not "trivially easy to guess" or "too ambiguous" [00:51:31].
    *   Focus on "durably useful" prompts [00:51:40].
    *   A key rule: "won't write a prompt on something that I don't understand" [00:52:08]. (An exception can be made for definitional terms to aid in acquiring vocabulary and gradually building understanding [00:52:36]).

### Question Generation and Structuring
Interview questions evolve throughout the preparation process, starting as a "Dumping Ground" [01:07:18]:
*   **Kanban Board (Obsidian Kanban plugin):** Used to organize and structure questions [01:02:47].
    *   Columns represent different topics or themes identified during research [01:06:00].
    *   An "uncategorized" column serves as a holding area for new ideas [01:06:03].
    *   Questions may be moved into themes or themes may emerge from clusters of questions [01:06:31].
    *   Questions are often messy, with multiple versions or overlaps [01:07:28].
*   **Physical Kanban Board:** A whiteboard can also be used, with different colored Post-it notes for ideas/points (yellow) and questions for the guest (pink) [01:25:21]. This allows for three-dimensional, hands-on reorganization [01:25:37].
*   **Prioritization:** The most aggressive organization and prioritization of questions occurs in the day or two leading up to the interview [01:07:56].
*   **Sequencing:** The Kanban board is crucial for ordering questions to ensure a logical narrative flow and establish premises before asking more complex questions [01:08:15].
*   **Meta-Notes:** Important reminders about interview technique or constraints (e.g., interview length, "don't talk unless you can improve upon silence") are pinned to the board or kept visible in the notes, acting as "meta-prompts" for interviewing [01:09:25], [01:10:49], [01:39:13].

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

### The Learning Curve
Intensive study often means learning "difficult material" that is "new to me" and "outside of my field" [00:48:38]. This highlights the ongoing [[challenges_of_mastering_new_fields_quickly | challenges of mastering new fields quickly]].

### Disappointments and Failures
Even with extensive preparation, moments of dissatisfaction or "failure" can occur:
*   Feeling inadequately prepared for an "incredibly important interview," leading to disappointment and "deep sense of guilt and shame" [01:17:17], [01:21:00].
*   Asking a question without sufficient prior work or genuine understanding, leading to disdain from the guest [01:21:13], [01:22:02]. A key rule is: "if you don't understand the question, don't ask it" [01:21:51]. This prevents the conversation from ceasing to be a genuine dialogue [01:22:40], [01:22:57].

### Balance and Satisfaction
*   **Over-preparation:** There's a realization that a "large portion of prep doesn't end up being useful" in the actual interview [01:28:55]. The prep itself becomes a valuable endeavor, even if not fully "cashed out" in the visible podcast [01:29:05].
*   **The "Joe Tier" of Interviewing:** The goal is to move beyond "low effort" interviewing to a level where the interviewer can "pose as not a peer but like a really interested, rising senior undergrad" capable of holding up a conversation and generating thoughtful follow-ups [01:29:28], [01:30:16]. This requires a different "degree of expertise" [01:20:00], [01:20:11].
*   **Broad vs. Deep Learning:** The "breadth-first" approach of covering diverse topics for different guests means knowledge compounds over a longer period compared to a "depth-first" approach focused on one domain [01:33:04].
*   **Desire for Improvement:** The drive for "more efficient" and "better prep" aims to allow for more interviews and a wider impact [01:29:42].
*   **Sharing the Process:** There's an aspiration to share elements of the intensive study process (Mochi decks, Obsidian notes, video recordings of study sessions, tutor calls) to make the invisible nature of knowledge work visible [01:29:09], [01:33:41]. This addresses the common perception that success is merely due to talent, rather than the effort involved in deep preparation [01:37:15].

David Deutsch postulates a rational basis for an expectation of progress, distinguishing it from mere optimism or temperament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. This perspective is rooted in the idea that progress is a reasonable expectation if problems are approached with the right knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## Core Principles of Progress

Deutsch's central idea is that:
> "unless something violates the laws of nature, all problems are solvable given the right knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

He also articulates a three-line motto or credo for this perspective:
> "problems are inevitable, problems are solvable, solutions create new problems which must be solved in their turn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

This framework implies an ongoing, iterative process of problem-solving and knowledge creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Knowledge, Creativity, and Problem Solving

The concept of progress is deeply intertwined with the creation of knowledge. Deutsch argues that the real challenge in advancing technology, such as [[Artificial Intelligence and Its Impact on Governance|artificial intelligence]] (AI), is not hardware limitations but "creating the knowledge to write the program to do the task that we want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:13]</a>. Knowledge acquisition is not instantaneous; it is limited by the rate at which empirical exploration can occur, such as conducting clinical trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:48]</a>.

Creativity is highlighted as a crucial, often undervalued, factor in human behavior and the outcome of people's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>. Deutsch argues that creative systems cannot be entirely obedient, as creativity often requires a degree of freedom and the ability to change values in response to conflicting goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:04">[01:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of "traditions of criticism" from the Enlightenment, which reconcile stability with the need for change and creativity, enabling exponential progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Addressing Perceived Limits to Progress

The idea of a rational basis for progress also confronts common pessimistic views regarding scientific and [[Technological revolutions and economic growth|technological progress]]:

### "Low-Hanging Fruit" Argument
Deutsch disputes the notion that all easy problems have been solved, and ideas are now harder to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>. He argues that fundamental discoveries not only resolve existing "low-hanging fruit" but also "create new fruit trees" (new problems and opportunities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>. He cites the field of quantum computers as an example of a new domain that emerged only after the existence of quantum theory and computers, creating new "low-hanging fruit" that didn't exist before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:36">[01:39:36]</a>.

### Cultural and Societal Factors
He points to cultural and societal factors as significant inhibitors of progress, rather than inherent limits to discoverable knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. These include:
*   The domination of fields by narrow perspectives (e.g., computer science by mathematicians with a "mathematicians misconception" of abstraction from physics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:26">[01:41:26]</a>.
*   A shift in scientific research away from fundamental discoveries towards "incremental solution of problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:11">[01:42:11]</a>.
*   Funding systems, career structures, and education that suppress the pursuit of fundamental understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:22">[01:43:22]</a>.
*   Irrational trends within universities, even in STEM subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:46">[01:43:46]</a>.
*   The rejection of the Enlightenment idea that the search for truth is possible and desirable, with journals sometimes suppressing results that might be perceived as demeaning or insulting to certain human groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:20">[01:45:20]</a>. This diversion from truth to other goals is seen as a "malign" influence that prevents humanity from taking advantage of new opportunities for knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:49">[01:44:49]</a>.

### Physical Limits to Growth
Addressing concerns about physical limits to growth (e.g., limits on output per atom), Deutsch contends that such extrapolations over vast timescales (e.g., 10,000 years) are "absurd" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:45">[01:47:45]</a>. Current cosmological theories are constantly evolving, and future scientific knowledge will likely reveal new possibilities at much smaller scales (e.g., quarks, quantum gravity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:02">[01:48:02]</a>.

Furthermore, human progress thrives on information and knowledge, not just material "stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:43">[01:49:43]</a>. Growth can consist of:
*   Better and more efficient information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>.
*   More entertaining virtual experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:52">[01:49:52]</a>.
*   More remarkable discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:01">[01:50:01]</a>.
*   More efficient ways of using resources (e.g., reducing energy needed for computation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:06">[01:50:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:55">[01:50:55]</a>.

These advancements do not necessarily require exponentially increasing energy or material consumption, as they depend on rearranging information, the possibilities of which are "unfathomably big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:08">[01:50:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:14">[01:50:14]</a>.

## Mitigating Risks

While acknowledging potential risks from malevolent actors or unintended consequences of technology, Deutsch emphasizes the importance of the Enlightenment and the concentration of powerful technologies like [[nuclear_nonproliferation_success_factors|nuclear weapons]] in the hands of "Enlightenment countries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:53">[01:34:53]</a>. This provides a "leeway" to prevent the widespread existence of dangerous state-level actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:16">[01:35:16]</a>. He suggests that the decreasing cost of developing powerful technologies over time needs to be met with the spread of Enlightenment values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:31">[01:35:31]</a>.

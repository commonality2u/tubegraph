When evaluating talent scouting or grant-making decisions, focusing solely on successful outcomes can be misleading. A key aspect of effective evaluation involves understanding the reasons behind failures and rejections, and assessing whether enough [[risk_assessment_in_talent_selection | risk]] is being taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## The Importance of Failure Rates

Early in a grant-making role, a question arose: if all chosen grantees were succeeding, was enough [[risk_assessment_in_talent_selection | risk]] being undertaken, and what was the failure rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>? This inquiry highlighted that continuous success might indicate an overly conservative approach, rather than optimal selection.

## Analyzing Rejections for Insight

To understand the decision-making process better, a specific exercise was undertaken:
1.  Reviewing all applicants who were *not* given a grant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
2.  Asking why they were rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
3.  Determining if the rejection was due to the project being "too risky" or "too out there," or if other problems existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

This [[rejection_analysis_in_talent_scouting | rejection analysis]] proved insightful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Findings from Rejection Analysis

Surprisingly, none of the rejections at that time were primarily because the project itself was too risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Instead, rejections stemmed from:
*   The applicant not having a very fleshed-out idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   The project not being *risky enough* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   The idea being "too cookie cutter" or "boring," not offering something uniquely needed in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Rejections based on a lack of novelty or developed ideas, rather than excessive [[risk_assessment_in_talent_selection | risk]], indicated a balanced approach to [[risk_assessment_in_talent_selection | risk-taking]] in selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Continuous Improvement in Decision Making

This exercise in [[rejection_analysis_in_talent_scouting | rejection analysis]] is highly recommended for new talent scouts or anyone in a similar evaluative role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. It's beneficial to perform this review every six months, going back to analyze past rejections and asking:
*   Was that the right call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>?
*   Why was that decision made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>?
*   Does that rationale still hold true six months later, especially after making more grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>?

This regular self-assessment contributes to [[continuous_improvement_in_decision_making | continuous improvement in decision-making]] processes.

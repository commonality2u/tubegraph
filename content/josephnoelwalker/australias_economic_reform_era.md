Australia's last significant [[reforms_and_improvements_in_public_policy_and_governance | economic reform]] occurred in the year 2000 with the implementation of a consumption tax, often referred to as the GST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. For 25 years since then, Australia has not made any major new improvements to its economic system, despite a pressing need for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Over the past two decades, productivity growth has been stagnant or falling, leading to a slowdown in the growth of real GDP per person, which is a key measure of living standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Ken Henry's Perspective on Reform
Ken Henry, who led the implementation of the GST, worked in both Treasury and Paul Keating's office during Australia's "golden era of economic reform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. He served as Treasury Secretary from 2001 to 2011, during which he led the Henry Review of Australia's tax system and helped Australia avoid recession during the global financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Historical Context of Economic Reform
Major [[reforms_and_improvements_in_public_policy_and_governance | economic reforms]] in Australia have historically taken a long time to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:57">[01:39:57]</a>. The consumption tax, introduced in 2000, had its origins in the Asprey Review, commissioned in 1972 and tabled in 1975, taking about 25 years to realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:57">[01:39:57]</a>. Similarly, income tax unification in 1942, arguably the first major tax reform, took 20 to 25 years after the Commonwealth government first began taxing income in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.

### The Impact of Technology on Public Service
The introduction of consumer software like Microsoft Excel and Word significantly transformed work processes in the Australian Treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Ken Henry recalls that using Lotus 1-2-3 (a precursor to Excel) allowed him to build complex economic models in two hours, a task that previously took a month using punch cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The Treasury was an early adopter of Microsoft Excel in Canberra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The computational power of these tools was considered mind-blowing and indispensable for the introduction of the consumption tax in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

The internet's introduction to government departments was initially hampered by security concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>. Ken Henry considers the internet one of humanity's greatest inventions, despite its misuses, due to the unparalleled speed of information access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>.

In the 1980s, about 50% of the Australian Public Service (APS) was in the lowest two bands (APS 1 and 2), largely due to the prevalence of roles like typist pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Today, this figure is around 5%, with technology automating away many such tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. The average seniority of staff in policy departments, like the Treasury, has increased over time, leading to flatter organizational structures where people contribute as equal team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

### Future Role of AI in Governance
The advent of powerful AI systems, potentially reaching human-level artificial general intelligence (AGI), poses fundamental questions for governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>. Ken Henry questions if there will still be a need for ministers, the judiciary, or even members of parliament if AI can perform most cognitive tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>.

A key concern is the potential for mass unemployment due to AI displacing knowledge workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>. Historically, technological advancements have made humans more productive without displacing them from the production process, contributing to sustained growth in real wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:53">[01:32:53]</a>. However, current AI developments suggest this may be time-limited, targeting the higher-level cognitive and creative thinking previously thought to be indispensable to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:12">[01:32:12]</a>.

This potential displacement of human labor raises significant questions about income distribution, as a shrinking pool of workers may not have the capacity to purchase services provided by AI-heavy production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:32">[01:37:32]</a>. This could necessitate new forms of taxation for income redistribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:12">[01:39:12]</a>. The challenge of taxing international digital services, which often exist beyond national borders, is already evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:44">[01:39:44]</a>.

Ken Henry emphasizes the importance of maintaining checks and balances in human form within government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:1:15">[02:1:15]</a>. While AI can provide impeccably researched briefs quickly, he worries that increased knowledge might make politicians even more cautious, potentially hindering necessary "crazy brave" reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:52">[02:22:52]</a>. Ministers still prefer human advisors for accountability and the ability to convey information in a way that resonates with wider audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:27">[01:15:27]</a>.

## Reasons for the End of the Reform Era
The decline in the pace of [[reforms_and_improvements_in_public_policy_and_governance | economic reform]] since 2000 is attributed to several factors:

### 1. Political Strategy and Mandate
The "small target strategy" in politics, where parties offer minimal policy proposals to avoid controversy, combined with the belief that a government lacks a mandate to implement policies not explicitly put to the electorate, results in inaction once in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:03">[02:28:03]</a>. This trend has seen a waning of political courage to be honest with the Australian people and sell big ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:57">[02:28:57]</a>.

### 2. Complacency and the "Mining Myth"
A significant factor is complacency, linked to Australia's self-perception in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>. The "mining myth"—the belief that mining alone underpins Australia's prosperity—has fostered a sense of comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:06">[01:44:06]</a>. Australia's terms of trade have been at historically high levels since late 2002, which may have reduced the urgency for further reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:30">[01:44:30]</a>.

The mining boom caused "crowding out" in the rest of the economy through domestic cost increases and an appreciation of the real exchange rate, equivalent to ripping off a 70% tariff on trade-exposed sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:22">[01:47:22]</a>. This significantly damaged Australia's manufacturing and export sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:30">[01:48:30]</a>. Despite this, the simple narrative of "killing the goose that lays the golden eggs" was politically potent against a mining tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>.

### 3. Decline in Political Ambition for Legacy
Ken Henry suggests a decline in the personal ambition of political leaders to leave an "impressive legacy" based on "hard stuff" rather than "easy stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:51">[01:49:51]</a>. He contrasts this with figures like Paul Keating, who sought to prove his national leadership, and John Howard, who, after an initial "ironclad guarantee" against the GST, pursued it to demonstrate his reformist credentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:26">[01:46:26]</a>.

### 4. Need for a "Burning Platform"
Ken Henry believes a "burning platform" narrative—a sense of urgent crisis—is indispensable to motivate [[reforms_and_improvements_in_public_policy_and_governance | economic reform]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:16">[02:02:16]</a>. Paul Keating's "Banana Republic" statement in May 1986 is cited as an example of a political leader successfully creating such urgency to trigger microeconomic and tax reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:24">[02:01:24]</a>.

## Proposed Future Reforms

### Tax System Reforms
If a substantial fiscal surplus were available (e.g., from a higher GST), the priority for tax reform would be personal income tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>. Ken Henry argues for indexing personal income tax scales to address "fiscal drag," where nominal wage increases push workers into higher tax brackets, leading to a reduction in real wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>. This fiscal drag undermines social cohesion and intergenerational harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.

Ken Henry expresses concern about [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | intergenerational equity]], noting that capital income is more favorably taxed than labor income, and capital gains are very favorably taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. This creates a situation where young people feel "robbed," especially when combined with high [[economic_factors_affecting_housing_affordability_in_australia | housing affordability]] issues and HECS debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>. He previously argued against indexing personal income tax but has changed his mind due to the reliance on fiscal drag to fix the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>.

The Henry Review (2010) recommended comprehensive road user charging, including a carbon component, to replace fuel excise, motor vehicle registration and driver's license fees, and stamp duties on motor vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:05">[01:43:05]</a>. This system would reflect damage done to roads based on vehicle weight, distance traveled, and potentially include congestion charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:07">[01:44:07]</a>. This reform, which was supported by motoring and trucking groups, remains undone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

### Population and Urban Planning
Australia's current high population growth strategy, largely driven by [[impact_of_immigration_on_the_australian_economy_and_demography | immigration]], concentrates growth within existing major cities, particularly Sydney and Melbourne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:59">[01:08:59]</a>. Ken Henry raised the question of Australia's sustainable population as early as 2007 with Kevin Rudd, suggesting a figure closer to 15 million but acknowledging that a population of 50 million could be sustainable with creative policies for where people would live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>.

He advocates for considering building new cities of significant size (e.g., 10 cities of 1 million people along the Sydney-Melbourne corridor) rather than solely expanding existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>. This approach challenges the traditional economic view that prioritizes efficiency benefits of larger cities over congestion externalities and the broader well-being components not captured purely by GDP per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:25">[02:09:25]</a>. Ken Henry points to Port Macquarie's growth driven by a new hospital as an example of strategic investment stimulating regional development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:57">[01:12:57]</a>.

On fertility, Ken Henry's research suggested that the optimal rate of population growth is the replacement rate (~2.1), as this minimizes the total dependency ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a>. While the baby bonus experiment seemed to temporarily increase birth rates, he believes that returning to a fertility rate above replacement would require substantial, sustained investment in childcare and other family support measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>.

### Investment and Industry Development
Australia has experienced "capital shallowing" over the last decade, meaning the investment rate has collapsed relative to workforce growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:07">[01:25:07]</a>. This is a significant factor in stagnant productivity. Australia's "mining boom narrative" does not present an attractive picture for global capital looking to deploy funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>.

Opportunities exist in:
*   **Critical Minerals Processing**: Australia has rich deposits of critical minerals but undertakes almost no processing, often exporting raw materials to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40">[01:29:40]</a>. Despite technical challenges and the "dirty" nature of some processes, Australia possesses significant expertise in chemical engineering that remains underutilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:29">[01:30:29]</a>.
*   **Engineered Wood Products**: Despite abundant native forests, Australia imports almost all engineered wood products for construction, losing value-adding opportunities in processing timber beyond raw chip or pulp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:19">[01:32:19]</a>.

This highlights a prevailing "mindset" that Australia's comparative advantage lies solely in extracting and exporting raw materials, rather than in creating factors of production or developing downstream industries, unlike countries like Singapore that have actively built their economic capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:01">[01:34:01]</a>.

## Public Service and [[state_capability_and_policy_efficacy_in_australia | State capability and policy efficacy]]
An effective senior public servant needs to be trusted, possess technical expertise, and be able to create and lead highly effective, motivated teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:26">[02:16:26]</a>. They must also be comfortable with ambiguity, as the public service environment often lacks clear boundaries of accountability and responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:52">[02:16:52]</a>. Ken Henry recalls consciously shifting Treasury's role from "Dr. No" (vetoing spending proposals) to a department that sought to assist other government agencies in policy development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:06">[02:15:06]</a>.

He noted the "deplorable" overlapping complexities in the allocation of roles and responsibilities between Commonwealth and state governments, particularly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic regarding aged care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:20">[02:05:20]</a>. He advocates for a comprehensive review of Commonwealth-State roles, starting with expenditure responsibilities, to deliver better outcomes for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. This would then inform a mature conversation about which tax bases should be exploited by each level of government, addressing issues like state-level stamp duties and taxes on insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:44">[02:07:44]</a>.

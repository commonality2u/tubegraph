The relationship between immigration and housing affordability is increasingly perceived in a zero-sum way, particularly in countries like Canada and [[link_between_immigration_policy_and_australias_demographic_challenges | Australia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## Immigration and Housing in the United States
In the United States, most [[zoning_regulations_and_their_impact_on_housing_supply | housing regulations]] are set at the local level, with some at the state level, leading to significant variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Areas with lighter regulation, such as Texas, experience massive population increases because people can move there affordably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. For instance, in Austin, affordable housing can be found just 45 minutes from the city, which is considered "crazy cheap" by the standards of places like San Francisco or New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

It is not necessary to fully deregulate housing before allowing immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Immigrants are already moving to places where construction is allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Even if housing prices increase due to immigration, it is still considered beneficial to allow people to immigrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. The argument is that if immigrants are driving up prices, the solution is to allow the industry to build more homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Many of the workers who would build these homes are themselves immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

Historically, the US coped well with modest levels of regulation for 50 years, even after zoning became prevalent in the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Regulation can be harmful in principle but not in practice if it's not strictly enforced or if there are loopholes and alternative building locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### Economic Benefits of Immigration
The primary [[economic_benefits_of_immigration | economic benefit of immigration]] is allowing workers to move from low-productivity areas to high-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. For example, a low-skilled worker from Haiti who moves to Miami or a Mexican farm worker who moves to an American farm can experience a skyrocketing in their earnings almost overnight due to higher productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. This is because productivity is higher in developed economies, whether it's through mechanized farming or by saving customers valuable time in service industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. This increase in productivity benefits not just the migrant but everyone, for instance, by producing more food for humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

Surveys often indicate that billions of people would move if allowed, driven by dramatic wage gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

## Mobility and Productivity Within a Country
Within a country, there are typically no legal limitations on internal migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. Historically, people in the United States would move from low-wage areas, like rural Mississippi, to high-wage areas, such as the Bay Area or California, to seek better opportunities and higher pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This internal migration was driven by the higher productivity and wages in more developed areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.

However, in the modern US, despite large gaps in measured productivity between regions, mobility has significantly declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. Studies show that while high-skilled individuals still move to high-productivity areas, low-skilled workers are moving in reverse, leaving places like San Francisco for areas in Texas where wages are lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. This counterintuitive trend is attributed to the exorbitant [[housing_costs_and_migration_patterns | housing prices]] in high-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. For lower-skilled workers, the percentage wage gain in expensive cities does not outweigh the increased housing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.

If [[potential_solutions_for_increasing_housing_supply | housing costs]] could be reduced to reasonable levels, this traditional economic pattern of workers moving to higher-wage, higher-productivity areas would likely be restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.

## Addressing Criticisms

### Impact on Wages for Domestic Workers
Some argue that low-skilled immigration pushes down wages for domestic low-skilled workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. However, estimates of this effect are small at best, and there is debate about whether it might even go the other way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. This is because low-skilled native and foreign workers often possess different skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. For example, native workers typically have better language skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Increased immigration can lead to low-skilled natives specializing in jobs requiring language skills, such as supervisory roles, effectively leading to promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Thus, low-skilled immigrants and natives can often be complements rather than substitutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

### Dilution of Innovation in Cities
The concern that allowing more people (especially lower-skilled workers) to move into high-skilled areas like the Bay Area might dilute innovation is often overstated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Agglomeration gains are based on the total number of innovators and geniuses within a certain proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. Adding more lower-skilled workers, such as janitors for companies like Google, does not inherently mess up the innovative mechanism, as long as people can still interact and physical proximity is maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. In fact, increasing the number of both low- and high-skilled workers in an area could raise total innovation by bringing currently isolated innovators into a central hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>.

### Agglomeration Effects and Housing Prices
While agglomeration effects can lead to higher rents and prices due to increased productivity and incomes, it is entirely possible to continue building more buildings to accommodate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>. The ability to construct housing is not scarce in the same way that human talent is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>. Even when a city's attraction from agglomeration peaks, there is still ample room to build more housing, making it affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. The supply of labor and resources to build is almost unlimited, unlike the scarce supply of "incredible human talent" that fills elite institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>.

### Entrepreneurship Gains in Economic Models
Standard economic models, when calculating productivity gains, often treat "total factor productivity" as a fixed element, which includes qualitative, technological, managerial, and entrepreneurial differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. These models do not typically account for dynamic changes where increasing resources (e.g., through more internal migration) might change total factor productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a>. Critics of these models might argue that increased migration could negatively impact total factor productivity, for example, by causing social disruptions or a fall in social trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

### Immigration and Social Trust
The concern that immigration leads to a fall in social trust is often based on surveys asking about general trust in strangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. While some research indicates that increased diversity might lead to a microscopic fall in trust, these findings are often overstated in their significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>. Additionally, the trust levels of immigrants can change as they assimilate into a new society, especially if they move from a low-trust environment (like a war zone) to a high-trust one (like Switzerland) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. Moreover, while very low levels of trust in countries can be problematic, many rich countries have widely differing levels of trust without hindering their economic success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>. Therefore, the impact of internal migration on social trust is likely modest at most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.

## Political and Social Aspects

### Public Perception and "Supply Skepticism"
A significant challenge in addressing [[causes_of_the_housing_crisis_in_australia | housing affordability issues]] is "supply skepticism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:49">[01:20:49]</a>. Studies in America and Australia show that a substantial percentage of the population believes that a large increase in housing stock would cause rents and home prices to rise, rather than fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>.

The resistance to new construction is often not primarily driven by personal financial harm (e.g., homeowners wanting to maintain property values) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:37">[01:22:37]</a>. Instead, it stems from a broader feeling that more construction would be "bad in general for human beings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:50">[01:22:50]</a>. Political views are often formed for philosophical reasons, not primarily based on objective material self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:39">[01:23:39]</a>. For example, people might oppose new construction due to concerns about traffic, parking, blocking views, or casting shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:12">[01:25:12]</a>. While these are valid concerns, they are often minor compared to the economic value generated by new construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:20">[01:25:20]</a>. The philosophical tendency is often to side with "complainers" and the status quo, even if it means sacrificing significant economic gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:48">[01:25:48]</a>.

### State-Level Deregulation Efforts
Many major "Yes In My Backyard" (YIMBY) policy changes have occurred at the state level, where state governments pressure localities to deregulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:22">[01:27:22]</a>. States like California, Oregon, and Minnesota have adopted policies to overcome local resistance to building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>. This leverage exists because local governments have no enforceable rights against state governments in the US system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>. State elites may recognize the benefits of deregulation and push for it, hoping that the long-term appreciation for lower [[housing market analysis | housing prices]] will outweigh initial dissatisfaction with the policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:01">[01:28:01]</a>.

While people generally support the idea of more affordable housing, they often prefer solutions like public housing, despite its limited supply and general lack of popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>. This suggests that policy preferences are often based on what "sounds good" rather than what is most realistic or effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:37">[01:29:37]</a>.

### Political Coding of YIMBYism
Currently, YIMBYism draws support from two main areas: left-wing activists in major blue cities and red states that are "YIMBY by default" due to lighter regulation and less resentment against construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:20">[01:32:20]</a>. However, it is predicted that YIMBYism is more likely to become left-coded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>. This is because vocal YIMBY activists tend to be left-leaning, leading to it being perceived as a left-wing movement in the media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:15">[01:33:15]</a>. Additionally, the focus on *changing* regulations in blue states garners more media attention than the *existing* low regulation in red states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:25">[01:34:25]</a>.

Statistical analysis of historical data on phenomena like market drawdowns, deaths from war, or pandemics often reveals that extreme events take a very long time to manifest. This can lead to the misleading appearance of a "thin-tailed" distribution, even when the underlying process is "fat-tailed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Concept of the Shadow Mean

The "shadow mean" refers to the true population mean of a data-generating process, distinct from the observed sample mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. For [[fattailed_vs_thintailed_distributions_in_warfare_data | fat-tailed distributions]], the observed sample mean can significantly underestimate the true mean because extreme events, which heavily influence the mean, are rare and may not appear in smaller samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Gaussian (thin-tailed) distributions are different; events that happen less than 1% of the time have less impact on the probability, so a small sample doesn't lead to a significant shadow mean effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For open-ended and [[fattailed_vs_thintailed_distributions_in_warfare_data | fat-tailed distributions]], most observations will be below the true mean, leading to a downward bias in the computed mean from empirical observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

For instance, the observed mean of a heavy-tailed industry like biotech can underestimate the true mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Conversely, in fields like insurance or banking, the observed mean might overestimate the true mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. If one is "selling volatility," the shadow mean will be much lower than the observed mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Application to Warfare

When applied to war, the process generating observed deaths visibly underestimates the true mean by approximately three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This means the historical process of war deaths underrepresents the true process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Research on the shadow mean has been published in various venues, including a paper in *Physica A* on wars, and applied to quantitative finance for operational loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Another critical innovation in the study of war is the concept of [[interarrival_time_and_its_significance_in_predicting_wars | interarrival time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The waiting time for wars with deaths exceeding 10 million people is estimated to be over 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Since the last conflict of this scale was World War II, nearly 80 years ago, it cannot be statistically inferred that violence is in decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The [[interarrival_time_and_its_significance_in_predicting_wars | interarrival time]] for wars has an exponential, memoryless distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This means that if such an event arrives on average every 100 years and none has occurred in 100 years, the expectation remains the same; one cannot infer that a war is "due" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to Fat-Tailed War Outcomes

The [[fattailed_vs_thintailed_distributions_in_warfare_data | fat-tailed nature]] of war deaths does not change over time; the scale of destruction changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Contributing factors to this fatness include:
*   **Increasingly Destructive Technologies**: The ability to kill is far greater now than in the past, with the process of killing becoming industrialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Globalization**: Violence can spread globally due to interconnectedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Incompetent Foreign Policy**: Decision-making regarding war, such as the US State Department's perceived incompetence in conflicts like the Vietnam War or Afghanistan, can lead to more mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Interventionist foreign policies, such as "spreading democracy," may be more dangerous than isolationism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## [[the_role_of_exaggerated_historical_death_counts_in_war_studies | Exaggerated Historical Death Counts]]

Historically, death counts in wars have often been exaggerated by both conquerors and victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Conquerors exaggerate to appear more intimidating, as seen with figures like Genghis Khan, for whom it was optimal to make people think many would be killed to prevent opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

Victims might exaggerate their suffering due to the "valorization of the victim," a concept central to Christianity and Shia Islam, which glorify victimhood and martyrdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. While ancient historical records are not clean, there are instances of fabricated martyrdoms in Roman Southern Mediterranean regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

To address these exaggerations, researchers analyze past wars by taking different accounts for each conflict and randomizing between high and low estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. For example, for the Algerian War, both French (280,000) and Algerian (1 million) estimates were used, and 150,000 histories were created through permutations of these numbers. This methodology consistently yielded the same "alpha" (scale parameter), indicating the robustness of the [[fattailed_vs_thintailed_distributions_in_warfare_data | fat-tailed structure]] despite varying estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Challenging the Decline of Violence Narrative

Based on the statistical properties of war data, it would require approximately 300 years without a conflict on the scale of World War II to statistically conclude that the distribution of war deaths has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The absence of such a conflict in the past 80 years provides no statistical information to support a decline in violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. There are currently no statistical grounds to assert that violence has declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

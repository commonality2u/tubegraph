Political pressure played a significant role in the expansion of credit, particularly in the housing market, leading to [[impact_of_easy_credit_policies | easy credit policies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Both political sides converged on the idea of expanding housing credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Motivations for Credit Expansion

The underlying motivation was a belief that making credit easier, especially for buying houses, would allow people to benefit from home appreciation, thereby increasing their wealth and portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This approach was also seen as a way to alleviate public worries, including those related to job insecurity or inadequate human capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Furthermore, expanding property ownership was considered a positive goal, with both political wings supporting the idea: the right favored more property owners in the system, and the left desired workers to own their houses and become wealthier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Political Response to Stagnant Incomes

A key factor driving political intervention was the stagnation of incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. When incomes were not growing, there was increased pressure on politicians to implement measures that would keep people content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Credit expansion became a mechanism to allow people to consume more through debt or equity, providing an illusion of prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

The perception was that individuals were not directly borrowing, but rather drawing down on existing home equity as home prices increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This "draw down" sounded more appealing than "borrowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. However, this was effectively borrowing against appreciation that was becoming increasingly fragile, often based on a speculative bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Consequences of Over-Expansion

While the expansion of credit had good intentions, it eventually became an excessive movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Too much credit, pushed too easily, can lead to harm, even for those receiving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. People might acquire credit at an inopportune time when prices are surging, subsequently finding they cannot afford the houses or the consumption it enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This situation contributed to issues reminiscent of the [[causes_of_the_2008_financial_crisis | 2008 financial crisis]] where home equity lines were drawn down, followed by price collapses, leaving individuals with no equity and significant debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

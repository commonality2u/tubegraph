[[the_impact_of_housing_deregulation_on_urban_development_and_city_dynamics | Housing deregulation]] is posited as a key driver for massive productivity gains within an economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This argument is often best understood by first examining the economic case for immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Productivity Gains Through Mobility: The Immigration Analogy

The primary benefit of immigration stems from moving individuals from areas of low productivity to areas of high productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Most people worldwide reside in low-productivity countries, while others live in high-productivity nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The idea that low productivity is an inherent quality of people is disproven by immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

For instance, a low-skilled shoe shiner from Haiti moving to Miami, or a Mexican farm worker moving to an American farm, sees their earnings skyrocket almost overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This increase in earnings is attributed to significantly higher productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. A farm worker on a modern, mechanized farm produces far more food than on a primitive farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Similarly, a shoe shiner in Miami is more productive because they save customers more valuable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

The economic case for immigration is that restrictions prevent workers from naturally moving to places where their productivity is higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Such moves can multiply someone's productivity by a factor of 10 in a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This leads to increased food production for humanity, benefiting both the migrant and consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Wage gaps due to productivity differences are so significant that surveys suggest massive migration would occur if people were allowed to move freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Internal Migration and its Historical Context

Within a country, there are typically no legal limitations on movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Historically, it was common for people from low-wage, "backwards" areas, such as rural Mississippi, to move to advanced, high-wage areas like the Bay Area for better opportunities and higher pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This trend was evident in the US, with both low and high-skilled workers moving from the South to high-wage areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

A notable example is the "Great Move to California" from the 1940s to the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Despite popular narratives like *The Grapes of Wrath*, for most people, this migration was positive, leading to higher-paid jobs and improved living conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. People moved because they could achieve higher pay due to higher productivity in more developed areas, which benefited from better technology or management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## The Modern Anomaly: Housing Costs and Reduced Mobility

Despite significant productivity gaps between regions in the modern US, internal mobility has substantially declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Research by economists Ganong and Shoag indicates that while high-skilled individuals still move from low to high-productivity areas, lower-skilled workers are moving in reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Low-skilled workers are leaving high-wage areas like San Francisco for places like Texas, where wages are lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

The explanation for this counterintuitive trend lies in the dramatic increase in [[impact_of_housing_costs_on_worker_relocation | housing prices]] in high-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. These high housing costs mean that only high-skilled workers see their percentage wage gains outweigh the extra cost of housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Workers prioritize their standard of living, which is calculated as wages minus the cost of living, with housing costs being the largest component of this difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Restoring Mobility Through Housing Deregulation

Given the persistent large differences in productivity across regions, and the historical period of lighter [[zoning_regulations_and_their_impact_on_housing_supply | regulation]] where housing costs between high and low-productivity areas were not vastly different, it is argued that restoring reasonable housing costs would also restore traditional mobility patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. If housing costs were brought down to affordable levels, workers of all skill levels would once again tend to move to places with higher wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

While the potential gains from internal migration might not be as extreme as the tenfold wage multiplication seen with international immigration, the productivity differences between areas like the Bay Area and the rural South are significant enough to suggest that reasonable housing costs in high-wage areas would still lead to considerable mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

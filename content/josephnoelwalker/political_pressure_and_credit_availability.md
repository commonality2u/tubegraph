The expansion of credit, particularly [[housing_credit_expansion | housing credit]], has been influenced by a convergence of political interests, driven by both good intentions and societal pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Initial Motivations and Perceived Benefits

There was a belief that making credit easier, for instance, by enabling people to buy houses and benefit from home appreciation, would positively impact their wealth and portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This approach was also seen as a way to alleviate anxieties, including those related to job security or insufficient human capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Furthermore, increasing the number of property owners was considered a societal good by both political spectrums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:
*   The right saw more property owners as beneficial to the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   The left desired workers to own their homes and become wealthier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
This led to a bipartisan push to expand [[housing_credit_expansion | housing credit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Negative Consequences of Excessive Credit Expansion

While expanding credit can be beneficial within limits, it can become harmful when it transforms into an unchecked movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Too much credit, pushed too easily, can negatively impact even the recipients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Harm can occur when:
*   Credit is obtained at an inopportune time, particularly as prices are rapidly increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   Individuals may find themselves unable to afford the homes they purchased or the consumption that easy credit initially facilitated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   Borrowers who drew down on home equity lines experienced significant losses when prices collapsed, leaving them with no equity and deep in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Political Pressure and the Debt Illusion

A significant driver for this policy was the political pressure on leaders to "do something" when incomes were not growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Expanding credit was perceived as a way to keep people content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. If incomes stagnate, increased consumption is primarily facilitated through debt or equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

This created an [[home_equity_and_debt_illusion | illusion]] where people felt they weren't borrowing because their home prices were rising, leading them to believe they were merely drawing down on existing equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The term "draw down" sounded less burdensome than "borrowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. In reality, they were borrowing against appreciation that was increasingly fragile, built upon a [[risks_of_a_housing_market_bubble | housing market bubble]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

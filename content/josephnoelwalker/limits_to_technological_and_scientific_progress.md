The concept of [[investment_and_future_of_technology | technological and scientific progress]] and its potential limits is a recurring theme in discussions among public intellectuals. While optimism often prevails, questions arise regarding intrinsic constraints on advancement and whether certain developments should be intentionally curtailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Halting or Slowing Development

The question of whether it is ever reasonable or appropriate to halt or slow the development of a new technology is complex and depends on the specific technology and arguments involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:32">[02:28:32]</a>.

For instance, "gain of function research" on virulent viruses might have costs that outweigh the benefits of the knowledge gained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:36">[02:28:36]</a>. However, imposing a moratorium on such research is problematic because "bad actors" would likely not comply, potentially gaining a military advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:40">[02:29:40]</a>.

Another consideration is whether a technology, like the atomic bomb, would have been invented without specific circumstances, such as a war and the expectation that adversaries were also developing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:13">[02:30:13]</a>. It's debatable whether such a technology has an "inevitable momentum" or if its development is contingent on deliberate investment of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>. While the secret of nuclear energy's possibility would likely have emerged eventually, its widespread development might have been different without the initial massive investment driven by wartime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:05">[02:32:05]</a>. The existence of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of "good guys" provides a buffer for decades, allowing time to suppress state-level "bad actors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:50">[02:34:50]</a>.

### The Problem of "AI Doom" Scenarios

The concept of [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_ai_technology | Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)]] and the associated "AI Doom" scenarios, such as an AI programmed to eliminate cancer by exterminating humanity or maximizing paperclips by turning humans into raw material, are often deemed preposterous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:42">[04:43:42]</a>. Such scenarios are considered artificial stupidity rather than intelligence, as true intelligence requires satisfying multiple goals, not just one to the exclusion of all others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:12">[04:47:12]</a>. The more sophisticated a system, the larger the network of people required to create it, making it subject to ordinary societal and corporate constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:04">[04:33:04]</a>.

Regarding [[limitations_of_super_forecasting | subjective probabilities]] applied to single instances, such as the "P Doom" (subjective probability that AI will cause human extinction), it is considered an attempt to quantify a subjective feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:56">[04:47:56]</a>. Assigning a numerical probability to such an event is often viewed as nonsensical, as it falls into the realm of "spectacular ignorance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:11">[04:49:11]</a>. If one assigns a probability other than zero or one to AI Doom, it implies a risk that could be used to justify extreme measures, regardless of cost, given the infinite negative utility of civilization ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:13">[05:11:13]</a>.

Instead of discussing subjective probabilities, it is deemed more productive to discuss the substance of what might happen if a computer performs unwanted actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:50">[05:21:50]</a>.

## Observed Slowdown in Progress

There has been an observed slowdown in [[investment_and_future_of_technology | scientific and technological progress]] since approximately 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:12">[01:36:12]</a>. Two main categories of explanations are proposed:

### "Low-hanging Fruit" Argument
One explanation posits that humanity has "picked all of the low-hanging fruits," implying that new ideas are inherently getting harder to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:23">[01:36:23]</a>. This suggests that easier problems are solved first, and subsequent problems naturally require more effort and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:12">[01:37:12]</a>.

However, this view is challenged by the idea that fundamental discoveries not only pick "low-hanging fruit" but also "create new fruit trees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>. For example, quantum computers could not exist before quantum theory and general computation were understood; they represent a "new problem creating new low-hanging fruit" that emerged from existing knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:36">[01:39:36]</a>.

### Cultural and Societal Factors
The second category of explanations points to cultural factors, such as increased bureaucracy in academia, a society that has become too risk-averse, or an excessive focus on safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:30">[01:36:30]</a>. Specific examples include:
*   **Retreat from Meritocracy:** Decisions in the United States, such as watering down gifted programs, specialized science and math schools, and educational commitments toward scientific excellence, potentially slow down progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:53">[01:37:53]</a>. This is sometimes done on the basis of concerns about equity across racial groups, which can supersede the benefits of nurturing scientific talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:23">[01:38:23]</a>.
*   **Instrumentalism and Overspecialization:** Scientific research has become increasingly directed towards incremental solutions rather than fundamental discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:11">[01:42:11]</a>. Funding systems, career structures, educational approaches for young scientists, and science journalism all contribute to an assumption that progress should be incremental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a>. This leads to a lack of interest in understanding fundamental impacts of technologies, like how quantum computation will affect our understanding of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:09">[01:43:09]</a>.
*   **Irrational Trends in Universities:** There are [[challenges_of_modern_progressivism_and_political_ideologies | irrational trends]] that have infiltrated universities, even in STEM subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:46">[01:43:46]</a>. This includes a rejection of the Enlightenment idea that the search for truth is possible and desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:28">[01:45:28]</a>. Guidelines in journals, such as *Nature Human Behaviour*, may even suppress results that could make one human group appear worse than another, or that might be considered demeaning or insulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:38">[01:45:38]</a>. If science must constantly flatter everyone, it diverts from the core goals of truth and deep explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:54">[01:45:54]</a>.

## Physical Limits to Growth

The idea that there may be a physical limit to how much civilization can grow in the universe is a source of pessimism for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:16">[01:46:16]</a>. For example, some thinkers suggest that if current economic growth rates (e.g., 2% per year) continue for 10,000 years, humanity would need to produce an implausible amount of output per atom within its reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:31">[01:46:31]</a>.

### Arguments Against Limits
This pessimistic outlook is largely dismissed for several reasons:
*   **Absurd Extrapolations:** Extrapolating current theories of cosmology 10,000 or even a million years into the future is considered absurd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:47">[01:47:47]</a>. Scientific knowledge changes dramatically over decades, making such long-term predictions unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:07">[01:49:07]</a>.
*   **Plenty of Room at the Bottom:** The concept of "plenty of room at the bottom" suggests that there are always smaller scales to explore and utilize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:53">[01:47:53]</a>. If atoms become a limiting factor, perhaps computers could be made from quarks, or even new quarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:02">[01:48:02]</a>. Below the quark domain lies the quantum gravity domain, which is many orders of magnitude smaller, potentially offering infinite space for future advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:36">[01:48:36]</a>.
*   **Efficiency and Knowledge-Based Growth:** There is no known lower limit to the energy needed to perform a given computation, implying that the efficiency of computation can increase without limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:14">[01:48:14]</a>. Human progress thrives on information and knowledge, not just on increasing amounts of "stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:43">[01:49:43]</a>. Growth could consist of:
    *   Better and more entertaining virtual experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:54">[01:49:54]</a>.
    *   More remarkable discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:01">[01:50:01]</a>.
    *   Faster searches in the space of possible drugs for disease cures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:23">[01:50:23]</a>.

These advances do not necessarily require exponentially more energy or material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:30">[01:50:30]</a>; they can thrive on information, which is not physically limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:40">[01:50:40]</a>. Future progress might involve replacing existing information rather than merely adding to it, leading to more efficient uses of resources like computer memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:46">[01:50:46]</a>.

Ultimately, optimism regarding progress is not just a matter of temperament but a rational analysis of history and what progress truly entails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>.

The concept of how society should weigh benefits and costs that occur at different points in time, particularly those in the distant future, is a complex philosophical and economic challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## The Importance of the Distant Future

The distant future is significant because it "will be inhabited by a very large number of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Their "pleasures and sufferings" will be "no less real" than those in the present, regardless of their temporal distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This idea is likened to geographical distance; just as distance in space (e.g., being in Australia versus Northern Virginia) does not diminish one's worth, temporal distance should not diminish the importance of future well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Social Discount Rates

A proposed idea is to have a positive social discount rate over a short time horizon (e.g., within a generation) but a zero discount rate over longer horizons (e.g., across generations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. However, this approach creates problems like "intransitivity" where inconsistent choices can lead to being "dutch booked or somehow gamed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Distinguishing What to Discount

The appropriate discount rate depends on what is being discounted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>:
*   **Cash Flows:** When discounting cash flows, whether for the near or distant future, a positive rate is generally appropriate due to the [[Impact of easy credit policies | opportunity cost]] of investing money and receiving a positive return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Happiness, Utility, or Well-being:** For concepts like happiness or well-being, there "should not be a discount rate across either short or long time horizons" to maintain consistency in choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Cultivating Long-term Thinking

Caring about the distant future often does not come naturally to most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The primary issue is not the difference in how people discount 100 years versus 500 years, but rather a "fixation on the very soon" or "what's bugging me now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

Despite this, many "highly successful people," investors, and countries with high savings rates demonstrate the ability to avoid obsessing over the immediate present, proving it is "not demanding the impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Cultural Factors and Savings Rates
Cultures with high savings rates, such as China during its period of rapid growth, often result from:
*   Accumulating income more quickly than learning to spend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   High precautionary demand for savings due to uncertain job situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
Being born into such a culture is cited as the "best thing you can do" to foster a long-term savings mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Practical Implications and Avoiding Paralysis

In the realm of consequentialism, people are asked to maximize utility subject to constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Societies that adopt a "rule consequentialist frame of mind" tend to "do much better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

When faced with decisions, uncertainty should not lead to moral paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Not taking action is itself a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The advice is to "try to do your best," "pursue maximum expected value," and "just avoid the moral nervousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This aligns with a "be a builder" philosophy, moving forward with action rather than getting caught in philosophical overthinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

The epistemic critique of consequentialism (that one can never know the full consequences of an action) is considered unconvincing because one typically has "some idea what is the better course of action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Even with wide uncertainty about future outcomes, a clear positive action, such as saving a child from a speeding car, is evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Connection to Economic Stagnation

The concept of the "Great Stagnation" describes a period in the Western world, beginning around 1973, where productivity growth rates slowed, wages increased more slowly (or not at all), and innovation, outside the tech sector, seemed to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This has led to lower living standards than if higher rates of economic growth had been maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

The concern with prolonged stagnation is not just missing out on better growth rates, but also the risk of thinking shifting from "positive sum to zero sum or negative sum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. This shift is observed when economies are shrinking and there's a sense of "fighting over scraps at the table," potentially eroding the "surplus" needed for successful democracies to maintain consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. Historically, zero-sum thinking was prevalent in pre-industrial times, linked to finite resources like land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>, and its re-emergence is a significant concern during periods of stagnation.

The Great Stagnation, which saw a slowdown in income growth, contributed to a tendency among policymakers to "juice up credit" and stimulate the housing market, partly leading to real estate bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>. This is further supported by the observation that in Australia, for example, there was awareness among politicians of the political importance of allowing constituencies to enjoy increased capital gains from housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>. This suggests a link between stagnant incomes and reliance on [[Consequences of borrowing against home equity | debt and capital gains]] to increase consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.

Australia's electoral system stands out among English-speaking democracies due to its unique features, including compulsory voting, [[preferential_voting_and_political_culture_in_australia | preferential voting]], and independent electoral administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This distinctiveness reflects a unique political culture that has evolved since the mid-19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Australia's Unique Electoral System
Unlike most other English-speaking democracies where voting is voluntary, Australia mandates it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While first-past-the-post systems are common elsewhere, Australia utilizes [[preferential_voting_and_political_culture_in_australia | preferential voting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Additionally, core Anglosphere countries (except New Zealand) vote on weekdays, whereas Australians vote on Saturdays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Australia was also the first country to establish an independent and professional electoral administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> and has been an innovator since the mid-19th century, notably inventing the "Australian ballot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Influences on Political Culture and Institutions
Australia's political culture is often described as majoritarian and bureaucratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Historian John Hirst characterized Australia as a [[influence_of_benthamite_thinking_on_australian_politics | Benthamite society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This influence stems from Jeremy Bentham's utilitarian philosophy being prevalent when Australia's political institutions were being established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. In contrast, John Locke's ideas of social contract theory and natural rights influenced the founding of institutions in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Key examples of [[influence_of_benthamite_thinking_on_australian_politics | Benthamite influence]] on electoral systems include Henry Chapman designing the secret ballot in Victoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> and Catherine Helen Spence's ideas on proportional representation, influenced by John Stuart Mill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Bentham saw rights as being given by government, not existing prior to it, which aligns with Australia's foundational experience as a colony set up by the British government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

The influence of Chartism, a working-class political movement from the 1830s, also shaped Australia's political culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Chartist demands included manhood suffrage (all adult men having the vote without property qualifications) and the secret ballot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Many immigrants to Victoria were influenced by Chartism, which itself was partly shaped by Bentham's ideas, suggesting a pervasive "Benthamite way of thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Another historical explanation for Australia's [[influence_of_benthamite_thinking_on_australian_politics | Benthamite society]] is that for its first 100 years, the British government largely funded Australian governments, leading to low taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Australians developed an attitude towards government as an entity that "just gave you stuff" without significant cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This fostered trust in government as potentially benevolent rather than oppressive, as it provided essential infrastructure like railways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This dependency on government for development and assisted migration likely weighed more heavily on political culture than abstract philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

[[historical_egalitarianism_in_australia | Egalitarianism]] and obedience to impersonal authority are two long-running strands of Australian political culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. [[historical_egalitarianism_in_australia | Egalitarianism]] may have stemmed from an early labor shortage giving workers more power than their English counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, or from the Gold Rush "shaking up" society and diluting hierarchies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. John Hirst noted that Australian [[historical_egalitarianism_in_australia | egalitarianism]] was most evident in informality of manners rather than necessarily in policies of redistribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Bureaucracies, being impersonal and meritocratic, align with this [[historical_egalitarianism_in_australia | egalitarianism]] by opposing fixed status by birthright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## Universal Manhood Suffrage
Australia achieved near-universal manhood suffrage by the 1850s, partly due to accidental factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. The New South Wales Legislative Council recommended a minimum property qualification of £20, but England decided on £10, a lower threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. This was counterintuitively designed to reduce the influence of wealthy ex-convict families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. The second "accident" was the Gold Rush, which caused inflation, pushing many people above the minimum property threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. Without the Gold Rush, universal manhood suffrage would likely have been achieved more slowly, despite higher wages in Australia compared to England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.

## Compulsory Voting
[[compulsory_voting_and_its_implications | Compulsory voting]] was first proposed in the Australian colonies in the late 19th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. The main argument for it was to ensure the government had the support of the majority of all eligible voters, not just those who chose to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. Notably, there was little philosophical debate against [[compulsory_voting_and_its_implications | compulsory voting]]; arguments about liberty, individual conscience, or freedom, common in the United States, were rarely raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Pragmatic concerns, such as administrative difficulties, were more common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

The Labor Party initially opposed [[compulsory_voting_and_its_implications | compulsory voting]] due to concerns it would compromise ballot secrecy, especially with the need for postal ballots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. However, once [[compulsory_voting_and_its_implications | compulsory registration]] was introduced in 1911, making registration permanent and automatic, [[compulsory_voting_and_its_implications | compulsory voting]] became almost inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. Bureaucrats favored it as it made their work more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.

The passage of the compulsory voting bill in 1924 was remarkably uncontroversial, preceded by only about an hour of Senate debate and opposed by only one person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. This lone dissenter, a Labor man and anti-conscriptionist, argued against state compulsion but ultimately voted with his caucus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.

[[compulsory_voting_and_its_implications | Compulsory voting]] strengthens majoritarianism, as it means governments derive authority from all individual votes, not just a motivated subset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. It is seen as a stabilizer in politics, ensuring that parties do not solely focus on mobilizing specific bases with highly emotive issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>. This encourages a more "sensible, levelheaded vote" from the moderate middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>.

## Preferential Voting
The Barton government's initial Electoral Act proposal in 1902 included [[preferential_voting_and_political_culture_in_australia | preferential voting]] for the House of Representatives and proportional representation for the Senate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. However, first-past-the-post was adopted for the House until [[preferential_voting_and_political_culture_in_australia | preferential voting]] was introduced in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. Proportional representation for the Senate only came in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

The adoption of [[preferential_voting_and_political_culture_in_australia | preferential voting]] in 1918 was largely driven by pragmatic political reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. Farmers' organizations, worried about splitting the non-Labor vote in three-corner contests and allowing Labor representatives to win, pressured the Nationalist government to implement it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. This system strengthens the political center, as seen in the early 20th century where it would have benefited the Deakinite Liberals by receiving preferences from Labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>.

[[preferential_voting_and_political_culture_in_australia | Preferential voting]] and proportional representation in the Senate allow identifiable interest groups and minor parties (like One Nation or the Teals) to exist and exert political pressure, accommodating increased social complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a>. This flexibility helps keep disgruntled groups within the political system rather than becoming marginalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. The number of House of Representatives seats decided on preferences has significantly increased over time, indicating its growing impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.

## Disenfranchisement and Re-enfranchisement of Aboriginal People
Prior to Federation, Aboriginal people were able to vote in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>. South Australian Aboriginal women also gained the right to vote when women's suffrage was introduced there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. Section 41 of the Constitution aimed to protect the voting rights of those already eligible, primarily South Australian women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

However, the 1902 Franchise Act, while not explicitly disenfranchising Aboriginal people in its initial draft, ultimately led to their exclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>. The debate was "unseemly," marked by straight-out racism and concerns about how many Aboriginal people existed (relevant for electorate divisions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. The Act disenfranchised "natives born in Asia, Africa, the Pacific Islands" (excluding Maori) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. Eventually, an amendment effectively excluded "full bloods or where Aboriginal blood predominates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. Electoral officers then interpreted this in a racially exclusionary manner, leading to Aboriginal people falling out of the political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. This outcome was not contingent but a result of prevailing views and ongoing frontier violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.

Aboriginal people finally regained the right to vote in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. There was a potential for earlier re-enfranchisement in the 1920s; an Indian man successfully challenged legislation preventing him from voting, leading to an exclusion for Indians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>. Had there been active Aboriginal organizations or lawyers to mount a similar challenge, they might have succeeded due to constitutional ambiguities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. However, this did not happen, reflecting the marginal position of Indigenous affairs in the thinking of political elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.

## South Australian Innovators
South Australia disproportionately produced key electoral innovators before Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>:
*   **William Boothby**: Responsible for the bureaucratic model of elections, developing impartial public servants to run them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>. He also introduced practical innovations like using a pencil instead of a dipping pen and marking a cross on the ballot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.
*   **Catherine Helen Spence**: Known for her ideas on proportional representation, which she called "effective voting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.
*   **Mary Lee**: A prominent suffragist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>.

The reasons for this concentration of innovation might relate to South Australia's history as a less populous colony, settled by free settlers without the anxieties of a convict past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>. The smaller scale fostered an openness to innovation, as seen in the lack of an entrenched upper class and the need for public servants to run elections due to a shortage of men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>. Its establishment by an act of British Parliament also contributed to a sense of "green fields" where new institutions could be tried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.

## Current and Future Considerations
Surveys indicate a declining trust in Australian political institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>. This trend is linked to [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | increased inequality]] over recent decades, particularly since the 1980s and the rise of neoliberalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>. Neoliberal policies, by dismantling state-owned utilities and prioritizing markets over government, have shifted resources away from collective provision, leaving many people vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>. The significant increase in property prices is also a major driver of generational inequality, contributing to public dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:49">[01:13:49]</a>.

While compulsory voting remains popular in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>, ongoing discussions about improving the system include:
*   **Fixed-term Parliaments**: All states and territories have fixed terms, but the federal government operates on a three-year floating term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06">[01:22:06]</a>. A four-year fixed term is seen as beneficial, providing governments more time to implement legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:19">[01:22:19]</a>.
*   **Voting from Home and Technology**: Voting from home is strongly opposed, as the act of voting is considered a public obligation that fosters a sense of collective society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>. The materiality of the physical voting process is seen as crucial for grounding the act in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:55">[01:19:55]</a>.
*   **Permanent Residents' Voting Rights**: There is an argument for allowing permanent residents to vote, similar to New Zealand, as they pay taxes and are committed to life in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>.
*   **Voting Age**: While there's a push for 16-year-olds to vote, no strong views were expressed on this during the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:05">[01:24:05]</a>.
*   **Campaign Funding**: Issues around campaign funding and automatic disclosure are also areas for potential improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:23">[01:21:23]</a>.

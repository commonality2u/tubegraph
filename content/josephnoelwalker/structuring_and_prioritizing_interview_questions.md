The process of preparing for a podcast interview involves significant time investment in [[interview_research_preparation|research and preparation]], which includes the crucial task of structuring and prioritizing interview questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This intensive process often spans days or weeks, requiring continuous adaptation and prioritization due to the vast amount of material available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Initial Orientation and Syllabus Development

When preparing for an interview, especially with a guest whose work requires mastering a significant amount of a field, the initial orientation involves seeking advice on a syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This often means speaking to professors or experts in the relevant field to understand what areas to focus on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Key questions asked when seeking advice for a syllabus include:
*   What are the most important parts of a textbook? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
*   Which chapters or topics are most important to focus on? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>
*   What can be omitted or left out given time constraints? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>

The goal is to furnish oneself with sufficient context for the interview and the guest's body of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Dynamic Reading List Composition

The reading list for an interview evolves constantly on a day-by-day basis during an intensive research sprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. This is because every hour provides more context, leading to a reconfiguration of priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. It's difficult to make a serious plan in advance, as the process needs to unfold organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

Key considerations in composing the reading list:
*   Identifying the most important topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
*   Determining which topics require the most time, especially if they are difficult to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   Identifying areas the guest has not frequently discussed to create original value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   Recognizing and challenging preconceptions about potential questions, actively seeking to refute or falsify initial hypotheses about what constitutes a "good" question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. This prevents asking questions that might make the interviewer appear uninformed or waste the guest's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

## Question Accumulation and Structuring

Questions are accumulated over a long period, sometimes years, in a dedicated note file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This initial note is a "dumping thoughts and vague ideas for questions," often including links to interviews, critiques of the guest's work, or other relevant sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

Periodically, these accumulated questions are consulted, particularly towards the end of the intensive research sprint when composing the final interview questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. This is often a serendipitous process of skimming through the notes and allowing ideas to jump out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>.

### KanBan Board for Organization

The process of structuring questions often leverages a KanBan board, using Obsidian's KanBan plugin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>.

The KanBan board structure:
*   **Columns:** Created based on different topics the interviewer wants to discuss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **"To Categorize" Column:** A crucial dumping ground where most initial questions are placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. These questions are often unperfected, with multiple versions or overlapping ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>.
*   **Prioritization:** The most aggressive organization and prioritization of questions occurs a day or two before the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.
*   **Sequencing:** The KanBan board is invaluable for arranging the narrative arc and sequencing of questions, ensuring a logical flow for the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. This allows for easy reorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>.

The KanBan board can also include "meta" cards, which serve as reminders for best practices, such as the number of questions to aim for in a given interview timeframe or the importance of adding context to questions for better answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.

## Principles for Crafting Effective Questions

The quality of questions is paramount to a successful interview. Adherence to certain principles is vital:

*   **Understand Before Asking:** A fundamental rule is to never ask a question that you do not genuinely understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. If you cannot comprehend the answer, it ceases to be a real conversation, limiting your ability to react, ask follow-ups, or dig deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:34">[01:22:34]</a>.
*   **Genuine Interest:** Questions should stem from genuine interest in the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:28">[01:22:28]</a>.
*   **Beyond Definitions:** Avoid questions that merely ask for definitions or presuppose an essentialist view of concepts (e.g., "What does this word mean to you?"). Such questions often lack value as they don't create new knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:45">[01:39:45]</a>.
*   **Concretize Abstract Concepts:** When dealing with abstract concepts (e.g., "liberal democracy"), strive to concretize them by relating them to real-world examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:35">[01:39:35]</a>. This avoids generic discussions and makes the conversation more engaging and specific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>.
*   **Anticipate and Prevent "Dumb Questions":** The extensive preparation, while not always visibly used in the interview, helps to avoid asking trivial or misinformed questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:45">[01:28:45]</a>. Asking penetrating questions that the guest hasn't been asked before can lead them to "lean forward" and provide more valuable, perhaps even previously unshared, answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:55">[02:59:55]</a>.

## Learning the Art of Interviewing

The preparation process is not only about learning the subject matter but also about developing the art of interviewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>. This meta-learning is also supported by spaced repetition prompts, covering techniques such as:
*   Knowing when to speak: Only "improve upon silence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>.
*   Transforming questions: Flipping the sign (e.g., asking "what wouldn't you do?" instead of "what would you do?") can make questions more interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>.

The ability to generate thoughtful and curious follow-ups in real-time, based on a thorough understanding of the domain, indicates a deeper level of expertise that comes from this rigorous preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:57">[01:19:57]</a>.

Australia faces significant challenges in managing unauthorized migrants, a situation that arose from policy missteps and has complex logistical and societal implications. A key challenge is the large number of individuals who have exhausted their visa options but remain in the country, contributing to an alleged "loss of control" over immigration numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

## The Problem's Origin and Scale

The current situation largely stems from a labor trafficking scam that emerged around 2015-2016, which led to a significant increase in asylum applications, predominantly from Malaysia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. These applications were often opportunistic rather than genuine, based on "cut and paste" narratives, and facilitated by criminal enterprises involved in labor trafficking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. The scam only slowed down with the closure of international borders during the [[Australias response to the COVID19 pandemic | COVID-19 pandemic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

Currently, approximately 100,000 individuals are in Australia who have run out of visa options and "shouldn't be in the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. The challenge is dealing with the 40,000 to 60,000 (and growing) people who have been refused visas but are not leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. Many of these individuals have been working in Australia for years and have established relationships within their local communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.

## Challenges of Mass Deportation

Attempting mass deportation is highly problematic due to:
*   **Prohibitive Costs:** It would be "a fortune" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. The largest component of this cost is detention capacity, potentially requiring vast, barbwire detention camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.
*   **Logistical Failures:** Such a program would inevitably lead to "tens of thousands of mistakes" and would ultimately "fail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.
*   **Economic Disruption:** Mass removals would "disrupt the economy enormously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.
*   **Societal Impact:** It could lead to a "permanent underclass of exploited people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:50">[01:30:50]</a>.

## Proposed Solutions

### Addressing the Backlog and Preventing Future Growth
1.  **Slow the application rate:** This is crucial, as doing anything at the other end is ineffective if the influx continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.
2.  **Adequate resourcing for primary decision-makers:** This allows for quicker processing of applications, preventing organizers from benefiting from work rights associated with asylum claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
3.  **Fund administrative review tribunals:** Increased funding helps to stabilize the growth in the backlog at the appeals level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
4.  **Investigate and prosecute organizers:** While money has been put into this, more prosecutions are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.

### Managing Existing Unauthorized Populations
For the tens of thousands who have been refused but are not leaving, a pragmatic approach is suggested:
*   **Pathway to Permanent Residence:** Find a "subtle way to give them a pathway to permanent residence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.
*   **Amnesty (de facto):** While politically sensitive, the cost of mass deportation would far outweigh the political cost of an amnesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.
*   **Historical Precedent:** Australia implemented a similar policy in 1993, creating the "one November category" visa for 40,000-50,000 Chinese students who were not going to return home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. This avoided costly asylum processing, and the children of these migrants have been very successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

### Minimizing Exploitation of Migrants
Exploitation is a persistent problem, particularly within low-skill visa programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>. Labor trafficking is the second-biggest criminal enterprise globally, after drug trafficking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:16">[01:15:16]</a>. Solutions to reduce exploitation include:
*   **Increase Migrant Agency:** Granting individual migrants more power and agency, such as the ability to move between employers in sponsored categories, reduces the employer's capacity to exploit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>.
*   **Stronger Penalties for Exploitation:** Introduce and enforce criminal penalties for employers, ensuring a genuine fear of significant repercussions beyond minor fines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:18">[01:25:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:05">[01:26:05]</a>.
*   **Increase Minimum Wage:** Ensure a transparent, cash-in-hand minimum wage for sponsored visas, which was frozen between 2013 and 2022, leading to increased exploitation risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:56">[01:26:56]</a>.
*   **Empower Unions:** Encourage and enable temporary migrants and students to join unions for protection against exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:25">[01:27:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>.

## Public Perception and Government Control
A persistent challenge is the public perception of government control over [[Government control and public perception of immigration in Australia | immigration policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. Policy changes often take years to show effects, leading to public dissatisfaction when actual net migration numbers diverge significantly from forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. This perception of losing control fuels negative attitudes towards migration and raises concerns about [[Australias population growth and urban planning | infrastructure capacity]] and service delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>.

Personal resilience involves learning from setbacks and adapting to challenging circumstances. This includes navigating difficult professional transitions and overcoming significant obstacles during emigration.

## Overcoming Professional Setbacks

A key aspect of resilience is the ability to not take professional rejections personally. After being informed at her 30th birthday that she had six months to leave her institute and find a new job, the individual learned a crucial lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. She emphasizes that repeated instances of being "kicked out" were formative, stating, "if I wouldn't be kicked out that many times I wouldn't be here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The core of this learning was to shift focus from the decision itself to subsequent actions:

> "It is important that don't take personally, don't take that you know somebody is deciding on that that you are you know a loser what is important what you do next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Navigating Emigration Challenges

In 1985, moving from communist Hungary to America presented significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The communist government attempted to prevent defection by severely limiting the funds emigrants could take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. For a family of three (two adults and a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter), only $100 was officially permitted ($50 per adult and child), with the expectation that employers would provide additional funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This restriction was designed to limit movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Ingenuity in Adversity

To circumvent these strict financial regulations, the family adapted by selling their Russian car on the black market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. They exchanged the Hungarian currency from the car sale for foreign currency (pounds, which were then equivalent to dollars) with Arabic students, as Hungarian currency was not freely convertible to foreign currency through official channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This illicit exchange yielded approximately $800, equivalent to about $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Although against the law, this act of resilience was necessary to facilitate their emigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

The challenge then became how to smuggle this money out of the country. The solution involved hiding the money wrapped and stitched inside their daughter Susan's teddy bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This method was so common that other Hungarians leaving the country would inquire about how she managed to bring extra money out, as it was impossible to emigrate to America with only $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The family meticulously ensured the teddy bear remained with them at the airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, with the two-and-a-half-year-old Susan unaware of her role in "smuggling" the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

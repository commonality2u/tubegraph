Early research aimed to create therapeutic protein-coding RNA that would not trigger an [[mrna_and_its_inflammatory_response | inflammatory]] response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. A key question arose regarding why synthetically produced RNA seemed different from RNA found inside cells and why it was so [[mrna_and_its_inflammatory_response | inflammatory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It was hypothesized that synthetic RNA, when introduced [[understanding_immune_response_to_external_rna | outside to immune cells]], caused an inflammatory reaction because RNA is not typically found outside the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Experimental Approach and Discovery

To understand the differences between synthetic and cellular RNA, researchers designed an experiment to compare the immune response to RNA isolated from human cells versus [[differences_between_synthetic_and_cellderived_rna | *in vitro* made RNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This involved placing both types of RNA onto special [[understanding_immune_response_to_external_rna | immune cells]] (human dendritic cells) and observing their response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Initially, it was expected that all tested RNA types would activate an immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

However, a significant finding emerged: isolated Transfer RNA (tRNA) did not induce any immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This led to the hypothesis that [[nucleoside_modifications_and_nonimmunogenic_rna | nucleoside modifications]], which are abundant in tRNA, might be responsible for making it non-immunogenic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Implications and Context

The primary goal of this research was not to create non-immunogenic RNA, as the existence of such a thing was initially unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Instead, the aim was to understand if synthetically produced RNA differed from cellular RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

While most RNA, including synthetic RNA, did induce an immune response, it was also noted that even the body's own RNA can cause an [[mrna_and_its_inflammatory_response | inflammatory]] reaction if it comes out of the cell due to injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

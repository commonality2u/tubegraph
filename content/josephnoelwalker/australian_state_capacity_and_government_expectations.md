Australia is recognized as having one of the highest levels of [[state_capability_and_policy_efficacy_in_australia | state capacity]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. State capacity refers to the government's ability to achieve its policy objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Beyond sheer spending, if measured by how well political decisions are implemented, Australia could be considered number one in the world for state capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This high capacity is supported by strong voter expectations, an efficient political system, and an egalitarian culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

## Drivers of High State Capacity

### High Voter Expectations
Australians expect public services to function like "an Apple product" â€“ working immediately out of the box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. If services, such as Medicare claims or Service New South Wales operations, do not perform efficiently, politicians face consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the United States, where public services are often characterized by long waits and widespread corruption, leading to lower public expectations and less political accountability for poor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. This expectation of competent service delivery creates a strong political incentive for government agencies to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Efficient Political System
Australia's political system has fewer barriers to passing legislation and implementing policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Much of the government's agenda, particularly budget measures, can be passed through the annual budget process, which is rarely blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. This contrasts with systems like that in the United States, where the legislature and executive are separate and designed to prevent the easy passage of legislation, leading to more friction and impediments to policy delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. This efficiency extends to revenue-raising measures, making it easier for Australia to secure funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

### Egalitarian Culture and Universal Stakes
Australia's egalitarian culture contributes to its state capacity by ensuring that wealthier citizens do not "opt out" of public services in the same way they might in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. For example, in the US, wealthy individuals might fly private or live in communities with private services (garbage collection, security, police) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. In Australia, however, most people, regardless of wealth, use public services like SmartGate for travel or rely on Medicare for healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This universal stake in public systems, such as Medicare, means that people across the income spectrum expect and demand high-quality service, creating pressure for the state to maintain its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Similarly, many affluent families send their children to local public primary schools, maintaining a broad societal interest in public education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

### Historical Influences on Expectations
The "dark matter" of Australia's [[state_capability_and_policy_efficacy_in_australia | state capacity]] and high expectations stems from two intertwined cultural strands: egalitarianism and a deep faith in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

*   **Labor Scarcity and Gold Rushes**: In the 1800s, Australia was characterized by scarce labor and plentiful land, giving workers a stronger bargaining position than in Europe or North America, leading to the early formation of trade unions and movements like the eight-hour day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. The Gold Rushes of the mid-1800s further diluted existing hierarchies, as wealth was determined by luck, leading to massive immigration that tripled the population within a decade and fostered social fluidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. This period saw the rapid implementation of democratic reforms, reinforcing an egalitarian ethos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.
*   **Benign View of Government**: During its first century, Australia's colonial governments were largely funded by the British government, resulting in low local taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>. This fostered an attitude where Australians viewed government as a benevolent entity that provided benefits without significant cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. Unlike the US, where private enterprise built railways, Australian governments developed much of the nation's early infrastructure (railways, ports, roads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. Governments also assisted many migrants in coming to Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. This historical context cultivated a deep trust in government's role as a public utility serving individual interests, rather than a potentially coercive force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. This perspective aligns with [[influence_of_benthamite_thinking_on_australian_politics | Benthamite utilitarianism]], which was influential when Australia established its political institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

## Policy Implications and Challenges

These strong expectations and high [[state_capability_and_policy_efficacy_in_australia | state capacity]] influence various policy areas. For example, [[australian_immigration_policy_and_population_aging | Australian immigration policy]] has historically prioritized slowing population aging, comprising about 80% of the motivation for the 2001 changes that increased skilled migrant intake, including overseas students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.

However, challenges remain. The housing affordability crisis, exacerbated by inelastic housing supply and high immigration levels, illustrates the difficulty of rapidly addressing complex issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. Even an extremely ambitious supply-side policy, exceeding the national cabinet's target of 1.2 million homes over five years, would still take 10 to 20 years to significantly reduce prices in major cities like Sydney and Melbourne by 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. While the system can deliver, the scale of some problems, compounded over generations, means solutions will take time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. The political constraints, particularly the middle class's reliance on housing for wealth creation, make aggressive supply-side reforms a "slow, decades-long grind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.

Ultimately, Australia's high state capacity and strong government expectations position it well to tackle complex policy challenges. The ongoing task for policymakers is to leverage this foundation to achieve ambitious goals, such as improving productivity and addressing the housing crisis, while navigating political realities and public expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>.

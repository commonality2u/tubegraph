Historical death counts, particularly concerning warfare, can be significantly exaggerated, leading to skewed perceptions of violence trends over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:03">[09:17:03]</a>. This exaggeration is driven by various incentives from both belligerents and victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:20">[09:20:20]</a>.

## Reasons for Exaggeration

### Conquerors' Incentives
Conquerors or aggressors have an incentive to exaggerate death tolls to appear more intimidating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:07">[09:23:07]</a>. Historically, figures like Genghis Khan would inflate reported killings as a tactical measure, as people were less likely to oppose them if they believed mass casualties were inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:02">[10:48:02]</a>. This often involved creating devastation for show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:26">[11:00:26]</a>.

### Victims' Incentives
The exaggeration of suffering by victims is a less intuitive, but equally significant, factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. This phenomenon can be linked to the valorization of victimhood, particularly in certain religious traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. Christianity and Shia Islam are noted as the only two religions that specifically glorify victimhood and martyrdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>. For example, Shia Islam observes 1300 years of mourning for martyrs like Hassan and Hussein, effectively glorifying those who were killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

The spread of Christianity may have driven the exaggeration of death counts on the victim side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. However, precise historical records from the period immediately preceding Christian dominance are scarce due to the historical narrative being largely written by Christians ("the winners") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. Despite this, evidence suggests fabricated or exaggerated martyrdom events existed, particularly in regions like North Africa and the Southern Mediterranean under Roman rule, with the same stories appearing in multiple locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>.

## Methodological Approach to Bias Correction
To address the issue of exaggerated death counts, researchers, such as Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Professor Pasquale Cirillo, have developed methodologies to obtain more robust [[fattailed_vs_thintailed_distributions_in_warfare_data | statistical perspectives on warfare data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

The core of this approach involves analyzing past wars by taking multiple accounts for each conflict and randomizing between high and low estimates for death tolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. For instance, in the Algerian War, estimates ranged from 280,000 (French) to 1 million (Algerians), which have since been revised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. By incorporating both numbers and randomizing between them, researchers can create numerous "histories"â€”up to 150,000 histories through permutations of high and low estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. This process aims to remove the effect of varying estimates from different parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

This rigorous method revealed that, despite the variability in reported figures, the underlying [[fattailed_vs_thintailed_distributions_in_warfare_data | alpha parameter]] (a measure of tail-fatness in a distribution) for war fatalities remains consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. The fatness of war distribution does not change when moving further into the past, only the scale changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

## Implications for Violence Trends
The application of this methodology, particularly the concept of the "Shadow Mean" (the population mean of the true underlying process), highlights that historical observation may underestimate the true mean of events like deaths from war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. For warfare, the observed mean may underestimate the true mean by as much as three times in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

Furthermore, studies on [[interarrival_time_and_its_significance_in_predicting_wars | interarrival time]] between wars, particularly those with death tolls exceeding 10 million (like World War II), suggest an average waiting time of over 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. This [[interarrival_time_and_its_significance_in_predicting_wars | interarrival time]] follows an exponential, or memoryless, distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Consequently, the absence of such a large-scale conflict for 80 years (since World War II) does not statistically imply a decline in violence <a class="yt>timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.

To statistically confirm a change in the distribution of war severity, one would need to observe a period of approximately 300 years without a conflict on the scale of World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. Without such a prolonged absence, there are no [[statistical_perspectives_on_global_violence_trends | statistical grounds to claim that violence has declined]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.

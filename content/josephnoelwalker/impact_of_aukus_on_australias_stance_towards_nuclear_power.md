The announcement of AUKUS in August 2021 significantly impacted Australia's perceived stance on nuclear power and weapons, leading to a notable shift in public and political discourse.

## Public Opinion and Political Shifts

Before AUKUS, there was a strong [[historical_perspective_on_antinuclear_sentiment_in_Australia | anti-nuclear sentiment]] in Australia, particularly evident in campaigns during the 1980s involving figures like Peter Garrett and the Greens Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. However, after the AUKUS announcement in September 2021 by the Morrison government, the expected popular [[reactions_to_australias_potential_nuclear_developments | reaction]] against nuclear power, especially concerning the potential presence of nuclear reactors in Sydney Harbour or HMAS Stirling in Western Australia, largely "never happened" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This absence of widespread opposition led to the observation that Australians appeared "more relaxed about nuclear power" than previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

A [[low_institute_poll_on_nuclear_weapons_support_in_australia | Lowy Institute poll]] in 2022 indicated that about 36% of Australians either supported or strongly supported Australia acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While this result surprised some, it was less surprising in the context of AUKUS, suggesting a changing [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons_in_australia | public opinion on nuclear weapons in Australia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This perceived shift in public acceptance of nuclear technology also played a role in the opposition's decision to announce civilian nuclear power as an election promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. However, some argue that public poll questions are often presented without full consideration of costs or trade-offs, implying that the public may not have fully "thought it through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Prerequisites for Australia to Consider Acquiring Nuclear Weapons

If Australia were to consider acquiring its own nuclear weapons, several [[prerequisites_for_australia_to_consider_acquiring_nuclear_weapons | basic preconditions]] would need to be met:
*   **Regional Proliferation First:** It is considered highly unlikely that Australia would acquire nuclear weapons before other regional powers, such as Japan and South Korea, do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. These countries face more acute security dilemmas with China due to their proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Taiwan, however, would likely not pursue nuclear weapons due to the difficulty of keeping such a program secret from Chinese intelligence, which would trigger an immediate invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Indonesian Acquiescence/Cooperation:** Crucially, Indonesia would need to be amenable to Australia acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Without [[australiaindonesia_strategic_relations | Indonesian cooperation]], Australia's acquisition of nuclear weapons could create more significant problems with Indonesia than it would solve with China, potentially making Indonesia an adversary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Credibility of Extended Nuclear Deterrence

The long-term credibility of America's extended nuclear deterrence, which protects allies like Australia, is a critical factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The bargain is that the US will use its nuclear weapons in defense of an ally if they are threatened, negating the need for the ally to develop their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

However, the emergence of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capabilities in countries like North Korea poses a challenge to this deterrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The question arises whether the US would risk a city like Seattle or Los Angeles for the defense of Seoul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This is considered an "impossible thing to ask of the Americans," as it would require sacrificing their own vital interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. South Korea has seemingly drawn this conclusion, developing more [[australias_selfreliant_defense_strategies | independent capabilities]] to counter threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

Australia and Japan, however, have opted to further integrate with the US alliance, with AUKUS partly serving this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Japan is also doubling its defense spending and strengthening ties with the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This approach is seen by some as less credible than South Korea's independent strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

### Nuclear Blackmail and Taboo

Despite concerns about the credibility of extended deterrence, Australia is considered unlikely to be plausibly threatened with nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This view relies on the "incredibly high" cultural taboo against nuclear use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Australia, being a smaller country, would not be the target chosen to break this taboo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

However, the more likely threat is nuclear blackmail, where a country like China threatens nuclear use to compel acquiescence without actual detonation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Examples include Russia's threats to NATO regarding Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a> and the US preventing China from invading Taiwan in the 1950s through nuclear threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. The effectiveness of nuclear blackmail relies on the target believing the threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. If a country like China is perceived as unwilling to use nuclear weapons, their threats would not be credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The [[implications_of_nuclear_blackmail_and_deterrence_by_countries_like_china | consequences of nuclear blackmail and deterrence by countries like China]] are so immense that even a small probability of nuclear use could influence decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. However, acquiring nuclear weapons itself presents significant costs for Australia, necessitating a careful weighing of the costs of different approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

At the University of Pennsylvania, a faculty member held a non-tenure research assistant professor position starting in 1989, which allowed them to have their own laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. However, they were required to secure external funding to establish themselves, writing grants monthly during their first two years at the university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These efforts faced [[challenges_of_securing_research_grants | challenges of securing research grants]], as proposals, including those for [[circular_rna_research_proposals_and_rejections | circular RNA research]], were rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

A university rule stipulated that if a faculty member did not establish themselves by securing funding within five years, they faced promotion or removal from the faculty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This policy led to the [[demotion_of_katalin_kariko_in_1995 | demotion]] of the faculty member in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This period of [[katalin_karikos_early_career_at_the_university_of_pennsylvania | Katalin Kariko's early career at the University of Pennsylvania]] was marked by continuous grant writing and research efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

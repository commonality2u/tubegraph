Economic productivity is significantly impacted by the efficient allocation of labor, particularly through migration from areas of low productivity to those of high productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a>. This principle applies both to international [[Economic benefits of immigration | immigration]] and internal migration within a country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

## The Case for Migration and Agglomeration
The fundamental economic argument for migration, whether international or internal, is that it allows workers to move from places where their productivity is low to places where it is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This can lead to a dramatic increase in earnings and overall output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:59">[02:39:59]</a>.

> For instance, a low-skilled worker from Haiti earning little as a shoe shiner can move to Miami and experience a significant increase in earnings, demonstrating vastly higher productivity due to the economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. Similarly, a Mexican farm worker moving to an American farm becomes significantly more productive due to modern, mechanized agricultural practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

Within a country, internal migration traditionally allowed workers, both low and high-skilled, to move from low-wage areas to high-wage, high-productivity areas, such as the significant movement to California in the mid-20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This historical pattern saw people moving from "backwards, low-wage places" to "advanced" areas to improve their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Housing Regulations as a Barrier to Productivity
In the modern U.S., a significant obstacle to realizing these [[Regional productivity disparities in the US | productivity gains]] is **[[economic_impacts_of_zoning_and_land_use_regulations | housing regulation]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Despite large productivity gaps between regions, internal mobility has declined substantially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

> Studies by economists Ganong and Shoag indicate that while high-skilled individuals still move to high-productivity areas, low-skilled workers are moving *out* of high-wage cities like San Francisco to lower-wage areas in Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This counter-intuitive trend is primarily driven by the "enormous" [[Housing costs and migration patterns | housing prices]] in high-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. For many, the percentage wage gain from moving to a high-productivity area does not exceed the increased housing cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

[[Impact of housing deregulation on productivity | Deregulation]] of housing is seen as a way to restore the historical pattern where workers of all skill levels could afford to move to higher-wage areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Measuring the Impact of Zoning
The "zoning tax" is a concept used to measure the cost of housing regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. Pioneered by Joe Gyourko and Ed Glaeser, their method involves comparing the market price of a home to the combined cost of the pure land value (if undeveloped) and physical construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. The difference is attributed to regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

> **Glaeser and Gyourko's Method** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>:
> 1.  **Value of Undeveloped Land**: They analyze homes that are otherwise similar but differ in the amount of undeveloped land. They found that the marginal value of additional undeveloped land is low, indicating that people don't highly value extra land if they cannot build on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. This highlights the inefficiency of minimum lot size regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.
> 2.  **Construction Costs**: They use industry-standard manuals to determine physical construction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:03]</a>.
> 3.  **The Zoning Tax**: The difference between the market price and the sum of raw land value plus physical construction costs is defined as the "zoning tax" or regulatory burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.

Critiques that the low value of marginal land is due to indivisibility (i.e., inability to build on small, odd-shaped parcels) are countered by the observation that developers consistently build to the legal limit, indicating a strong desire to maximize units per land area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. Furthermore, later work by Gyourko using prices of actual vacant lots supports the robustness of their findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

Recent critiques of influential papers measuring productivity gains, such as the 2019 paper by Hsieh and Rossi-Hansberg, have identified "basic multiplication errors" and "strange model[s]" that, when corrected, often show even larger potential gains from [[Potential solutions for increasing housing supply | housing deregulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:40:00">[31:40:00]</a>. This suggests that the true impact of deregulation on productivity might be underestimated.

## Agglomeration and Innovation
Urban centers facilitate "agglomeration gains," where a concentration of talent and resources leads to increased productivity and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. These gains are tied to the total number of "geniuses and innovators" within close proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

> The argument that an influx of lower-skilled workers due to deregulation would "dilute" or "mess up" the innovativeness of places like the Bay Area is challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Many jobs in these areas are low-skilled, and even Google hires janitors who aren't "Cutting Edge of janitor science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. Instead, increasing the overall population, including low-skilled workers who support high-skilled ones, would likely increase total innovation by allowing more innovators to congregate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

The idea that deregulation might lead to higher rather than lower rents in major cities due to intensified economies of scale is countered by the principle that the ability to construct buildings is not scarce, unlike human talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. While the demand for living in high-productivity areas will increase, the supply of housing can also increase dramatically if regulations are removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:36]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a> The impact of **[[Impact of AI on economic growth | AI]]** on economic growth and innovation suggests that early advancements ("low-hanging fruit") are often more transformative than later ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. The difficulty of reaching the research frontier increases over time, necessitating more minds working on the same questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Therefore, larger populations and greater agglomeration effects become increasingly important for sustaining innovation and productivity growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

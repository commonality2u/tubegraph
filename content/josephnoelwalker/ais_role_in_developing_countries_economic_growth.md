The potential for [[economic_implications_of_ai_and_agi | Artificial Intelligence (AI)]], particularly [[economic_implications_of_ai_and_agi | Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)]], to accelerate economic growth in developing countries is a significant area of discussion for policymakers and economists alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

## AI's Impact on Policy Making in Developing Countries

The success of Asian economies, which have seen consistent GDP growth of 7.5% per year, suggests that effective [[the_role_of_the_public_service_in_economic_policy | economic policy]] can lead to substantial increases in GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. However, social and political constraints can often impede progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

Larry Summers believes that [[ai_applications_in_economic_policy_making | AI applications in economic policy making]] could significantly enhance growth in developing countries through several mechanisms:

*   **Knowledge Transfer**: [[economic_implications_of_ai_and_agi | AI]] has the capacity to make knowledge universally accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. Historically, transferring knowledge, such as the intricacies of setting up a successful textile factory from Britain to the United States in the early 19th century, was challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>. With [[economic_implications_of_ai_and_agi | AI]], information known in one place is likely to become known everywhere, facilitating a more rapid transmission of knowledge, which is seen as the most crucial positive factor for accelerating development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.
*   **Improved Decision-Making**: Developing country policymakers face difficult choices regarding monetary policy and strategic sectoral policies (e.g., which sectors to promote) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. [[economic_implications_of_ai_and_agi | AI]] could enable a more accurate and comprehensive distillation of past human experience, allowing for better extrapolation to new situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. This enhanced understanding is expected to contribute to wiser [[the_role_of_the_public_service_in_economic_policy | economic policy]] and consequently, more rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.

It is important to note that while [[economic_implications_of_ai_and_agi | AI]] can improve knowledge and decision-making, the pace of change may be slower than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. Benefits often take longer to materialize but can then happen faster than initially thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.

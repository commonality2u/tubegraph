A 2022 poll by the Lowy Institute revealed that approximately 36% of Australians either support or strongly support Australia acquiring nuclear weapons, a finding that surprised many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This public sentiment might be influenced by the announcement of AUKUS in August 2021, which led to a notable absence of popular opposition to nuclear power in Australia, suggesting Australians are more relaxed about it than previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Prerequisites for Australia Acquiring Nuclear Weapons

For Australia to be justified in considering acquiring nuclear weapons, several basic preconditions would need to be met:

*   **Regional [[nuclear_proliferation_and_its_implications | Proliferation]] First**: It is considered highly improbable that Australia would go nuclear before countries like Japan and South Korea. These nations face more acute security dilemmas with China due to their geographical proximity, making it harder for military power to be projected against Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
    *   Taiwan, despite its security dilemma with China, would likely not pursue nuclear weapons because its open society and deep penetration by Chinese intelligence would make it impossible to keep such a program secret, potentially triggering an invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   Japan and South Korea, however, might consider this option if American withdrawal were imminent or if they lost faith in the [[challenges_related_to_extended_nuclear_deterrence_and_us_alliances | extended nuclear deterrent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Indonesian Acquiescence**: Crucially, Indonesia would need to be amenable to Australia acquiring nuclear weapons. Without Indonesian acquiescence or, ideally, cooperation, any problem Australia might try to solve by going nuclear would be undercut by the problems created with Indonesia, potentially making Indonesia an adversary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Credibility of Extended Nuclear Deterrence

[[challenges_related_to_extended_nuclear_deterrence_and_us_alliances | Extended nuclear deterrence]] refers to the agreement where a nuclear-armed state pledges to use its nuclear weapons in defense of an ally that does not possess its own nuclear arsenal, thereby precluding the ally's need to develop them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

The credibility of this deterrence is increasingly questioned. For example, in the Korean case, the emergence of North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capability means it can now threaten US cities with nuclear warheads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This fundamentally alters the bargain: the US is asked to risk a nuclear attack on its own cities (e.g., Seattle, Los Angeles) in defense of Seoul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Such a demand is considered not credible and an impossible thing to ask of the Americans, not due to a lack of moral character or courage, but due to a cold-blooded assessment of their vital interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

Consequently, South Korea has seemingly drawn the conclusion that it must develop more independent capabilities to counter the North Korean threat, rather than solely relying on the US. In contrast, Australia and Japan have, to this point, opted to further entrench their alliances with the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## The Nuclear Taboo and Blackmail

A key argument is the "nuclear taboo" – the incredibly high cultural barrier against nuclear use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. It is argued that a country like China would find it difficult to break this taboo against a relatively small country like Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

However, a significant concern is not direct nuclear use, but "nuclear blackmail" – where a country like China threatens to use nuclear weapons to deter another nation from engaging in conventional warfare or to compel acquiescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

*   **Contemporary Example**: Russia's ongoing threats of nuclear blackmail to deter direct US and NATO intervention in Ukraine illustrate this post-Cold War dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
*   **Historical Precedent**: China itself experienced nuclear blackmail in the 1950s when the US threatened nuclear use to prevent a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, a threat that proved effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

There is a debate whether nuclear blackmail is a distinction without a difference from actual nuclear use. Nuclear blackmail is only effective if the threatened party believes the threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Therefore, if one believes China would never actually use nuclear weapons, then its threats would not be credible, allowing a country like Australia to "call the bluff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

Despite the inherent risk, weighing the costs of facing nuclear blackmail against the huge costs of Australia becoming a nuclear weapons power is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. The ingrained nature of the US-Australia alliance, deeply embedded in bureaucracies, intelligence sharing (e.g., Five Eyes), and political culture, further complicates any fundamental reassessment of relying on extended nuclear deterrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

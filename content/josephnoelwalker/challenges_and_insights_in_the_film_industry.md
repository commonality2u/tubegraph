The film industry, particularly concerning box office success, is inherently unpredictable and challenging to navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This unpredictability stems from the nature of [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_modern_technological_innovation | innovation]] itself, where if a new technology or hit could be predicted, it would already exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. As quoted from Alan Kay, "the best way to predict the future is to invent it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Unpredictability of Success

Every new movie can be viewed as an innovation, and it is never certain in advance which one will be a hit with audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Veteran Hollywood screenwriter William Goldman famously stated that "nobody knows anything" when it comes to predicting box office success, citing examples like *Raiders of the Lost Ark* and *Star Wars* being rejected by most studios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

Systematically producing hits is difficult because it's not just about selecting a good script, but about how all the pieces of the production—lead actor, director, producer, and the right timing—will align and work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Luck also plays a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### The Evolution of a "Hit"

What constitutes a "hit" has changed. In the past, it was about theatrical box office performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Now, a hit is more likely to be consumed on streaming platforms like Netflix or Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Anecdotal Evidence of Unpredictability

Mark Cuban recounted his experience with HDNet Films and 2929 Pictures, founded in 2003, with the goal of vertical integration in movie production and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

*   **Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room**: Cuban greenlit this documentary in 12 minutes for $770,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. It became one of the top-grossing documentaries of its time and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Good Night, and Good Luck**: His partner Todd Wagner brought this project, a black-and-white film starring George Clooney. They paid $4 million for half the production budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. It garnered six Academy Award nominations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

After these initial successes, accumulating seven Academy Award nominations across the first two movies, Cuban felt the process was "easy" and that he "had the touch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. However, subsequent projects "went straight into the shithouse," demonstrating how challenging it is to consistently succeed in movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Customer Preference and Innovation

Customers often "know it when they see it" rather than being able to articulate what they want in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. This concept is exemplified by the evolution from horse-drawn buggies to cars, or from radio to streaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. If creators only gave people what they wanted, progress would stagnate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

Bethany McLean, a former guest on the podcast, praised Mark Cuban as an "excellent executive producer" for *Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## Impact of Blockchain Technology

The emergence of blockchain technology and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) is poised to significantly change the film and content industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. The ability for a creator to set a percentage of royalties to receive every time a digital asset is resold is "game-changing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. This allows original creators to continuously earn income from their digital content, whether it be artwork, music, videos, or podcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. This shift empowers content producers by providing new monetization avenues beyond traditional advertising or sponsorship models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. This widespread adoption was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as more people stayed home and explored new digital economic models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

## Business Strategy and Disruptive Innovation

The book *The Innovator's Dilemma* by Clayton Christensen is a foundational text in understanding the [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_technological_development | challenges and opportunities in technological development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. A key takeaway from the book is the importance of "checking your hole card"—constantly re-evaluating the fundamental premises of your business to ensure they are still applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. Businesses must remain vigilant because there is always competition and potential disruptors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

The "innovator's dilemma" is that the very practices that make a business successful—good management, listening to customers, product line development—can also lead to failure when disruptive technologies emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. These disruptive technologies are often cheaper, simpler, and initially appeal to a niche market, offering lower margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. The core of the dilemma is that companies become comfortable with what works and fail to disrupt themselves, leaving them vulnerable to external disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.

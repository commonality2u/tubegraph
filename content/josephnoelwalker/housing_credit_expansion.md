## Initial Intent and Bipartisan Support

The expansion of housing credit was initially conceived with good intentions, aiming to enable individuals to purchase homes and benefit from house appreciation, thereby increasing their [[impact_of_easy_credit_on_wealth | wealth]] and portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This approach was also intended to alleviate various concerns, including those related to job security or insufficient human capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Both political sides converged on this idea; the right favored increasing the number of property owners, while the left aimed for workers to own their homes and become wealthier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While expanding housing credit can be a positive step, it requires limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Negative Consequences of Excessive Credit

However, the expansion of housing credit evolved into an excessive movement, with too much credit pushed too easily, ultimately causing harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Individuals who received credit were harmed, often obtaining it at inopportune times when prices were rapidly escalating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This led to situations where people could not afford the houses or the consumption that easy credit facilitated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Many drew down on their home equity lines, only to find that property prices collapsed, leaving them with no equity and deep in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Political Motivations and the Illusion of Wealth

There was significant [[political_pressure_and_credit_availability | political pressure]] on politicians to expand housing credit, particularly when incomes were stagnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This strategy served as a means to keep people content, as it allowed for increased consumption through debt or equity when income growth was absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

This created an illusion that individuals were not truly borrowing, but rather drawing down on existing equity due to rising home prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The term "draw down" sounded more favorable than "borrowing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. In reality, people were borrowing against appreciation that was increasingly fragile, as it was based on a [[risks_of_a_housing_market_bubble | bubble]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

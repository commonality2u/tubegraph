The characteristic of Australian culture for at least 150 years has been its [[historical_egalitarianism_in_Australia | egalitarianism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Paradoxically, this ethos crystallized around the 1890s, a period of much higher [[economic_inequality_trends_in_Australia | economic inequality]] than today, marked by stark social disparities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. For example, by 1910, the top 1% received 12% of all personal income, and the top 0.1% received 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Historical Trends in Australian Inequality

Post-Federation, the story of [[economic_inequality_trends_in_Australia | Australian inequality]] has two distinct phases:
*   **Decline (Federation to 1970s)**: Inequality fell from its highs around Federation through to the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Increase (1980s to Today)**: From the 1980s to the present, inequality has risen, approaching levels seen in the 1910s depending on how it's measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Andrew Leigh, Australia's Assistant Minister for Competition, Charities, and Treasury, and Assistant Minister for Employment, has extensively researched inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Drivers of Increased Pre-Tax Income Inequality Since the 1980s

Three major factors have driven pre-tax income inequality in Australia since the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>:
1.  **Technology and Globalization**: These forces have increased returns for "superstars" across various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.
2.  **Reduction in Union Membership**: Union membership has drastically fallen from half the workforce in the early 1980s to about one in eight today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Unions previously played a significant role in the labor market, fighting for better conditions at the bottom and acting as an equalizing force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.
3.  **Reductions in Top Tax Rates**: These reductions track quite strongly with increased inequality. Lower top tax rates mean less dividend returns are taken, leaving more to reinvest, which can lead to higher earnings in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. This also incentivizes people to take on more work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. These three factors are estimated to contribute roughly a third each to the rise in inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.

## Measuring Inequality

While various metrics exist, such as the Gini coefficient, the use of tax data to estimate top incomes or wealth shares has two advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>:
*   It allows for historical analysis before surveys were common, extending back a century with annual data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
*   It provides a more easily understood metric, such as the income share of the top 1%, which aids public conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

## The [[impact_of_education_on_inequality | Impact of Education on Inequality]]

Technology tends to automate routine tasks, affecting lower-skilled workers, while complementing non-routine, creative tasks, making higher-skilled workers more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. The computer revolution of the late 1990s and early 2000s did not increase Australian inequality as much as American inequality because Australia's education boom was delayed and continued into the 21st century, providing a supply of high-skilled workers to meet demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

However, the quality of Australian education has been a concern:
*   **Declining Scores**: Australia has seen poor performance in math and literacy scores since mid-century, and PISA scores have deteriorated since the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.
*   **Teacher Quality**: This decline is partly linked to changes in the teaching profession. In the 1960s and 1970s, gender pay discrimination in other professions (like law and medicine) channeled many talented women into teaching and nursing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. As gender pay gaps reduced from the 1970s onwards, talented women flowed into other fields, and teaching wages did not significantly increase to continue attracting the same level of academic talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. This decline in teacher academic aptitude is correlated with a backward movement of half to a year of achievement in Australian test scores over recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.

### The Tyranny of Merit and Education Policy

Michael Sandel's concept of "The Tyranny of Merit" suggests that individual upward mobility through education can be an inadequate solution to inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. It implicitly judges those without credentials as less meritorious, potentially leading to populist backlash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. For policymakers, this means recognizing that many labor market outcomes are due to luck, not just merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

Policy responses should focus on:
*   **Creating More Educational Opportunities**: This includes increasing access to TAFE and university, especially for first-in-family students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.
*   **Quality Across Schools**: Ensuring that every school provides a great education, regardless of its location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.
*   **Teacher Remuneration and Workload**: Ensuring teachers are appropriately paid and can focus on educating rather than excessive paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

## Market Concentration and Housing

Market concentration can exacerbate inequality through two main mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>:
1.  **Monopolies**: These can raise prices, transferring income from poor consumers to wealthy shareholders. Since consumption is evenly distributed but shareholding is highly concentrated, this "gouges the many and gives to the few" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>.
2.  **Monopsonies**: In labor markets, monopsonies can pay workers lower wages than they would receive in a more competitive market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.

While the empirical effect in Australia is hard to quantify due to a lack of good metrics, uncompetitive markets are considered detrimental to both growth and fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. Deunionization is hypothesized to have a more significant impact on inequality than market concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.

The massive bull market in Australian housing over recent decades has also increased wealth inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>. Housing wealth is more unequally distributed than income, and the time it takes to buy a typical house has substantially increased from four years after World War II to 11 years today, making housing affordability slip out of reach for more Australians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.

## Policy Instruments to Tackle Inequality

### Taxation

Reductions in top tax rates are strongly linked to increasing inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. An inheritance tax, while present in other countries, is considered politically impossible to implement in Australia due to minimal revenue generation and significant public opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.

### Social Safety Net

Australia's social safety net is the most redistributive in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. It provides 12 times more welfare to someone in the bottom fifth of the distribution compared to the top fifth, making it an efficient engine for redistribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>. The Australian unemployment benefit also looks more like a universal basic income than in many other countries, being flat-rate and enduring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. While high effective tax rates for people on moderate incomes can be a side effect, these are often less "salient" to individuals compared to regular income tax scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:59">[01:19:59]</a>.

### Promoting Innovation and Equality

Policies should aim for "Sweet Spot" solutions that simultaneously [[reforms_and_improvements_in_public_policy_and_governance | increase the size of the pie]] and distribute it more fairly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Educational Opportunities**: Providing great educational opportunities to people from disadvantaged backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.
*   **Competitive Markets**: Promoting more competitive markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
*   **Supporting Entrepreneurs**: Creating opportunities for entrepreneurs with great ideas but lacking money or connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>.
*   **Social Safety Net**: Maintaining a social safety net encourages innovation by reducing the downside risk of failure, allowing people to "start and fail and then start again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>.

## [[ai_applications_in_economic_policy_making | AI's Potential Impact on Inequality]]

While concerns exist about AI automating jobs and impacting the labor-capital ratio, there is also optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>. Recent randomized trials have shown that AI tools can significantly improve performance (20-40% for management consultants, 20% for coders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. Crucially, the biggest gains were observed among lower-performing workers, suggesting a potential "equalizing effect from AI" within industries, which contrasts with past technologies like computerization that increased within-market inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

For low-skilled workers facing automation, the best strategy is to provide general skill sets and higher, generalist education that allows for career changes as the labor market shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:23">[01:08:23]</a>.

## Rebuilding Community and Social Fabric

Inequality can damage the social fabric, fostering a sense of "we versus me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>. Rebuilding community and expanding educational opportunities, especially for disadvantaged backgrounds, are key priorities for an egalitarian agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>.

## Effective Policymaking and Evaluation

A critical aspect of advancing an egalitarian agenda is rigorously testing policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>. Randomized trials, similar to those used in medicine, are a valuable tool for evaluating social policies to ensure they work effectively, rather than relying solely on good intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. The Australian Centre for Evaluation is working to uplift evaluation capacity across [[the_role_of_the_public_service_in_economic_policy | the public service]] to ensure credible counterfactuals in policy assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.

## Limitations on Government Control

Despite the various policy instruments available, factors outside of government control, such as globalization, technological shocks, and historical events like wars and famines, also significantly impact inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:14">[01:26:14]</a>. The broad trends in top income shares across Anglo-Saxon countries, for instance, show surprising similarity despite different political parties in power, suggesting larger forces at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:08">[01:25:08]</a>.

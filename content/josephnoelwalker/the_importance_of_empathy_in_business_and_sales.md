Empathy is a crucial trait in business and sales, enabling individuals to understand and connect with others on a deeper level. Mark Cuban emphasizes that empathy, listening, and a genuine desire to help are fundamental to success, distinguishing effective approaches from mere transactional interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

## Empathy in Sales

Mark Cuban learned early in his career that understanding customers' desires and making it easy for them to fulfill those desires is key to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. His former statistics professor, Wayne Winston, noted that Cuban's underrated skill as a businessman is his ability to entertain customers, a lesson he learned from owning a bar in college called Motleys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

Cuban elaborates that people work hard for their money and seek experiences that are worth their time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. They want to alleviate boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. By making fun easy and affordable, businesses can attract customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, as exemplified by the popularity of the Kamikaze shot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

Cuban defines sales not as convincing someone, but as believing in your product and helping people based on what you know about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. The core of effective sales is understanding what a prospect needs and then providing a product or service that addresses that need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

### Tips for Cold Pitches (especially by email)

When making a cold pitch, particularly via email, preparation is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Cuban advises:
*   **Understand their needs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>: Put yourself in the shoes of the CEO or the person you're trying to sell to. Ask, "What makes my life easier? How can I reduce my stress?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
*   **Format your message to address challenges** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>: Frame your communication around their recognized pain points.
*   **Be authentic and committed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>: Show that you've done your homework and are genuinely interested in finding out what they need to help them.

Cuban states that "empathy helping they're the same thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. You cannot effectively help someone without feeling empathy for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

## Empathy in Leadership and Society

Cuban's working-class upbringing, including the knowledge that a quarter of his mother's family perished during the Holocaust, enabled him to empathize with struggling and marginalized individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. He maintains that despite his own success, he never lost sight of the significant role luck plays in people's lives, a trait he considers rare among successful businesspeople <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

In the political sphere, Cuban applies similar principles, emphasizing the need for empathy to bridge divides. He highlights that people rebel when their expectations for life significantly diverge from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. When a leader or figure shows they understand and offers hope, people will trust them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. He advocates for listening to and engaging with those who hold different perspectives, as genuine connection is a powerful tool against hatred and disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. Cuban believes that people ultimately desire commonality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

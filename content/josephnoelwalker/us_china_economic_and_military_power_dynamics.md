## China's Economic Rise

For over a century, the United States has not faced an adversary or coalition whose GDP exceeded 60% of its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This threshold was not crossed even by the combined might of Japan and Germany during World War II, nor by the Soviet Union at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. China, however, surpassed this 60% mark in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. On a purchasing power parity basis, China's GDP entirely surpassed that of the US in 2017 and is now more than 20% larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Inevitably, this economic power is being converted into military might <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This represents a much bigger challenge than the [[comparison_of_chinas_challenge_to_historical_threats_like_cold_war_and_world_war_ii | Cold War]] and is already economically a bigger challenge than Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

## US Strategic Future in Asia

The central question regarding the [[us_and_china_strategic_relationship | US and China strategic relationship]] is whether the United States will have the resolve to fight China for dominance in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. According to Sam Roggeveen, a key belief is that the US will not fight for dominance because it lacks vital interests in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Three potential strategic futures for America in Asia include:
1.  America fighting China for dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
2.  America entering a power-sharing relationship with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
3.  America leaving the region entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

### Challenges to US Dominance

*   **Defense Spending**: US defense spending as a percentage of GDP has been trending downwards since 2011, currently sitting between 3.4% and 3.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. During the Cold War, it reached about 8%, and during the Vietnam War, 6-7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. For the US to convince China it is serious about fighting for dominance, a much higher level of spending and other signals would be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Lack of National Mission**: No American president since China's rise as a great power has declared the contest with China as a [[americas_national_mission_regarding_chinas_rise | national mission]] that the entire country must devote itself to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. This kind of "whole of nation" effort, bigger than the Cold War, cannot be done quietly; it requires public commitment from the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   **Intellectual and Cultural Engagement**: The intellectual environment and popular culture in the US do not indicate readiness for a contest of this scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. There is a [[lack_of_intellectual_and_popular_cultural_engagement_with_chinas_challenge | lack of intellectual and popular cultural engagement with China's challenge]] beyond Beltway foreign policy circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the Cold War, which saw the development of "Cold War liberalism," or the "War on Terrorism," which obsessed intellectuals and media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

### Power Sharing vs. Withdrawal

While Hugh White believes America will leave Asia entirely, Roggeveen argues for a long "interregnum" – a period of power sharing between China and the US – before a full withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. The US posture in Asia, including troop deployments in Japan and South Korea, has remained relatively constant since the end of the Cold War, even as China has massively expanded its military capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. This means the US has been declining *relative* to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

Roggeveen attributes the US's continued presence to high bureaucratic barriers to withdrawal and low incentives for withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. The same bureaucratic barriers, however, also limit a rapid increase in American force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. This inertia keeps the US roughly where it is, leading to relative decline as China's defense spending continues its "massive tear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

!> **Trump's Influence:** Donald Trump is seen as an accelerant of the withdrawal trend, though his first administration lacked the bureaucratic backing and his own talent/diligence to enact his vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. While barriers to change have lowered, the competency levels in the administration have also lowered, making it unclear if they can *build* anything new rather than just *break* existing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.

China's own agency might push the US out of Asia by raising the costs of American inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. However, Roggeveen argues that for China, the difference between a reduced US presence (power sharing) and full withdrawal is not significant enough to risk confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. China would prefer to watch the US "shrink in place" as a low-risk option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

## Intelligence Assessment of US-China Dynamics

Sam Roggeveen's experience as a senior analyst at the Office of National Assessments (now Office of National Intelligence) and the Defense Intelligence Organization provided him access to top-secret intelligence from the Five Eyes community (Australia, US, Canada, UK, New Zealand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

His significant conclusion regarding long-term international issues like [[us_and_china_strategic_relationship | American decline]] and [[us_and_china_strategic_relationship | China's rise]] is that access to classified intelligence is of "negligible value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The quality of analysis from open sources is no worse than that produced inside the intelligence system for these long-term issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Intelligence agencies hold a significant advantage in short-term assessments for specific briefings, but this advantage has diminished over the past 16 years due to the information revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Espionage is a rational response to information deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. However, we now live in a world of "information super abundance," where the primary challenge is managing and understanding the overwhelming amount of open-source information, rather than uncovering new secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The business model of the intelligence world faces an unprecedented threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Intelligence agencies often focus on "puzzles" (knowable facts, like North Korea's nuclear weapon count) rather than "mysteries" (unknowable intentions, like North Korea's nuclear objectives), as puzzles are easier to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## Nuclear Proliferation and Deterrence in Asia

The prospect of American withdrawal from Asia raises concerns about [[nuclear_proliferation_and_regional_security_dynamics_in_asia | nuclear proliferation and regional security dynamics in Asia]], particularly for Japan and South Korea, which would need to dramatically increase defense spending and develop their own nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

The credibility of America's extended nuclear deterrence (the "nuclear umbrella") for its allies is being questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. With North Korea developing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of hitting US cities, the bargain with South Korea changes. The US using nuclear weapons on South Korea's behalf, at the risk of its own cities, becomes "not credible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>. This assessment is based on vital interests, not moral character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a>.

South Korea appears to be drawing the conclusion that it must develop more independent capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>. In contrast, Australia and Japan have so far pursued a strategy of tying themselves even more closely to the US, as partly seen with AUKUS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

For Australia to consider acquiring its own nuclear weapons, two preconditions are:
1.  Japan and likely South Korea must go nuclear first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. Taiwan is unlikely to go nuclear due to the difficulty of keeping a program secret from China and the risk of immediate invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>.
2.  Indonesia must be amenable or cooperative with Australia's nuclear ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>. Without Indonesian acquiescence, the problems created by Australia going nuclear would outweigh any security benefits against China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.

Roggeveen argues that Australia could potentially call China's bluff on nuclear threats, believing China would never use nuclear weapons due to the incredibly high cultural barrier against such use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42">[01:09:42]</a>. However, he acknowledges that the consequences of a miscalculation are so large that even a small probability of nuclear use or blackmail affects decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:42">[01:12:42]</a>. Nuclear blackmail, while distinct from actual use, only works if the threat is believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[assessment_of_americas_preparedness_for_a_contest_with_china | assessment of America's preparedness for a contest with China]] reveals complexities. The current geopolitical landscape suggests a steady, relative decline of American power in Asia, forcing Australia to become "more free" and self-reliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>. The shift in Australia's economic and foreign policy focus towards Asia, away from its Anglo-Saxon partners, aligns with this future, though defense policy has been a "hold out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>.

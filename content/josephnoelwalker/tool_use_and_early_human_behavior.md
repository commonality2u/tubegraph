The discussion between Peter Richardson and Robert Boyd, considered co-founders of the field of [[cultural_evolution_and_its_significance | cultural evolution]], delves into the earliest evidence of tool use and its implications for early human behavior and evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Their work represents a significant augmentation to Darwinian evolution since the Neo-Darwinian synthesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Earliest Evidence of Tools

The oldest known tools found, often referred to as Oldowan tools, are approximately 2.6 million years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. However, even simpler tools, predating Oldowan, have been found at Lomekwi, dating back 3.3 million years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. These Lomekwi tools were likely created by flinging stones at hard surfaces to produce sharp flakes, a method simpler than "napping," which involves using two hands to strike off flakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Although there was initial controversy, most researchers now agree on the 3.3 million-year age for these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Further evidence of early tool use comes from cut marks on animal bones (bovid and angil) found just a few kilometers from the Lomekwi site in Ethiopia, dating back 3.4 million years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This indicates that something was using tools to cut flesh from bones at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Australopithecines and Tool Use

Fossils from about 3.2 million years ago show that Australopithecines had evolved a precision grip in their hands, suggesting selection pressure for increased dexterity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This raises the question of whether [[cultural_evolution_and_its_significance | cumulative cultural evolution]] was already occurring among Australopithecines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Some argue that early Australopithecine tools were too simple to indicate [[cultural_evolution_and_its_significance | cumulative cultural evolution]], suggesting they could be reinvented by an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. However, given their smaller brains (only slightly larger than chimpanzees), these simple tools might have required cultural transmission for Australopithecines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

Observations suggest that technology among Australopithecines might have evolved in "bubbles" that would persist for a time and then be lost, as many Australopithecine sites show no tools or cut marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This implies a continuum of tool-making ability, similar to chimpanzees who make tools involving two or three steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

A significant mystery remains regarding what most Australopithecines did with their increasingly modern-looking hands, as stone tools only offer a tiny window into their probable tool-making activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. It is speculated they might have been carrying sticks and stones for defense against predators like lions and giant hyenas in open country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Transition to Early Homo

A clear difference emerges with early Homo (around 2 million to 1.8 million years ago), where fossils are never found without stone tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This contrasts with the Australopithecine archaeological record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

[[Bipedalism and brain size evolution | Australopithecine brain size]] remained flat for about 1.5 million years (from 3.5 to 2 million years ago), whereas early Homo shows a steep increase in brain size, reaching 1000-1100 CC by 1 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Something significant happened during this transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## Confident Evidence of Cumulative Cultural Evolution

A lower bound for when [[cultural_evolution_and_its_significance | cumulative cultural evolution]] was definitively achieved in the human lineage is estimated to be around 300,000 to 500,000 years ago, during the Middle Paleolithic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. At this time, there is evidence of prepared core tools, and knowledge of fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. These "archaic" humans, sometimes referred to as Homo heidelbergensis or Proto-Neanderthals, had brains comparable to or even larger than modern humans by the later stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

A key site in Israel, Yesha Yak, shows organic remains, an elephant skeleton, and evidence of eating acorns, fish, and turtles from this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. Processing acorns, especially bitter varieties, would have involved detoxification, indicating complex technological knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. The complexity of manufacturing hand axes also suggests advanced cognitive abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.

## Tool Use as an Adaptation to Climate Variation

The [[impact_of_climate_variation_on_human_evolution | onset of Pleistocene climate fluctuations]] (around 1.5 million years ago onwards), characterized by rapidly varying temperatures and precipitation, is a potential causal factor for the increase in [[bipedalism_and_brain_size_evolution | hominin brain size]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. The climate during the last ice age was described as "hugely chaotic," preventing ecological equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>.

[[Cultural_evolution_and_its_significance | Culture]] is seen as an adaptation to this climate variation because it evolves faster than genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:59">[00:51:59]</a>. The high metabolic cost and fragility of large brains suggest they must provide significant benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>. Adaptation to spatial and temporal variation, especially high-frequency variation, would help pay this overhead cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>. Individual learning handles adaptation on individual lifetime scales, but it is lost without [[cultural_evolution_and_its_significance | cultural transmission]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>. Cultural evolution is fast enough to keep up with variations on millennial and centennial timescales and preserves useful information across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>. This suggests that [[cultural_evolution_and_its_significance | cultural evolution]] "economizes on individual learning" by spreading the cost of innovation across a population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.

The evolution of cultural brains appears to be a highly contingent process, involving multiple "exogenous shocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>. Key factors include:
*   Becoming bipedal around 5 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>.
*   High predation levels on African savannas, creating selection pressures for social grouping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.
*   The [[impact_of_climate_variation_on_human_evolution | onset of Pleistocene climate variation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>.
*   Shifting to a more predatory lifestyle in early Homo, leading to changes in social organization and cooperative breeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:48">[01:15:48]</a>.

These factors created a unique set of circumstances that led to the evolution of human intelligence and [[cultural_evolution_and_its_significance | cumulative culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>. The pre-adaptations of apes, such as relatively large brains and sophisticated social structures, coupled with the ability of bipedal Australopithecines to use their forelimbs for making and carrying technology, were crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a>. Carrying tools is particularly important, as quadrupeds would have to abandon tools or carry them in their mouths, unlike bipedal humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:52">[01:20:52]</a>.

A 2022 poll conducted by the Lowy Institute revealed that approximately 36% of [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons_in_australia | Australians]] either supported or strongly supported [[public_opinion_on_australia_acquiring_nuclear_weapons | Australia acquiring nuclear weapons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Poll Findings

The survey indicated that a significant portion of the [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons_in_australia | Australian]] population supports the nation obtaining nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Context and Interpretation

The results of the poll surprised some observers, particularly given the historical context of [[historical_perspective_on_antinuclear_sentiment_in_australia | anti-nuclear campaigns in Australia in the 1980s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Expectations that these campaigns would intensify following the announcement of [[impact_of_aukus_on_australias_stance_towards_nuclear_power | AUKUS]] did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

There has been no significant [[reactions_to_australias_potential_nuclear_developments | popular reaction to the idea of Australia acquiring nuclear reactors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This absence of public backlash suggested that [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons_in_australia | Australians]] might be more accepting of nuclear power than previously assumed, which in turn made the poll's findings less surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Methodological Considerations

A point of consideration in [[polling_methods_and_interpretation_in_nuclear_weapons_surveys | interpreting poll results]] is that [[polling_methods_and_interpretation_in_nuclear_weapons_surveys | poll questions are generally presented without counterfactuals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For example, when [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons_in_australia | Australians]] are asked if they desire [[public_opinion_on_australia_acquiring_nuclear_weapons | nuclear weapons]], they are not typically presented with accompanying costs or trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

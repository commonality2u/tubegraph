Bryan Caplan's book, "Build Baby Build: The Science and Ethics of Housing Regulation," which is his fifth book, explores the [[the_economics_and_ethics_of_housing_regulation | science and ethics of housing regulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. His core idea across his works is that "the world's wrong because human beings are wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. People make mistakes because they aren't trying hard enough, often throwing away common sense when it conflicts with their emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This applies to the problems with housing and immigration.

## Housing Deregulation and Economic Growth

In a fully [[housing_deregulation_and_productivity | housing deregulated]] America, downtowns would likely gain the most in percentage terms due to current high regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. In cities, it's particularly difficult to build skyscrapers, and in places like San Francisco, this is compounded by strict regulations on historic sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. In suburbs, multi-family housing is restricted, with about 80% of residential land reserved for single-family homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Even for single-family homes, regulations often require wasting land due to minimum lot size rules, sometimes demanding two or even five acres for a single house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. With deregulation, there would be "more leg room for everybody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, and housing would be affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This would allow people to live in spacious apartments, even in expensive cities like Manhattan, rather than tiny, costly ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Measuring the Impact of Zoning

The impact of zoning regulations on house prices has been measured, notably by Joe Gyourko and Ed Glaeser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Their method involves comparing similar homes where some have more undeveloped land to see how much people value pure land without building permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. They found that the marginal value of additional land is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, highlighting the inefficiency of minimum lot size regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

They define the "zoning tax" metaphorically as the difference between the market price of a property and its physical construction cost plus the raw value of land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Later work by Gyourko using prices of actual vacant lots yielded similar results, supporting the method's soundness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This contrasts with common critiques that the low valuation of marginal land is due to indivisibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Developers typically aim to maximize the number of properties on a given land area up to the legal limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### Productivity Gains

[[housing_deregulation_and_productivity | Housing deregulation]] is expected to yield massive productivity gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Historically, people in the U.S. commonly moved from low-wage, backward areas (like the rural South) to high-wage, advanced areas (like California) to seek better opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. This mobility, both for low and high-skilled workers, was driven by higher pay due to higher productivity in the advanced regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

However, modern U.S. data show that while large productivity gaps still exist between regions, mobility has fallen significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. Low-skilled workers are even moving *away* from high-wage areas like San Francisco to places like Texas where wages are lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. This is because [[impact_of_housing_costs_on_worker_relocation | housing prices]] in high-productivity areas are so enormous that the percentage wage gain often doesn't offset the extra housing cost for lower-skilled workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. If housing costs were brought down to reasonable levels, this traditional economic pattern of workers moving to higher-wage, higher-productivity areas would be restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>.

## Immigration and Economic Growth

The main [[economic_benefits_of_immigration | economic case for immigration]] is that immigration restrictions prevent workers from moving from low-productivity places to high-productivity places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. Examples include a shoe shiner from Haiti moving to Miami or a Mexican farmworker moving to an American farm, where their earnings (and thus productivity) skyrocket overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. This directly benefits the migrant and also contributes to overall societal well-being (e.g., more food for humanity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. Surveys often suggest that billions of people would move if allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

### Linking Immigration and Housing

Immigration and housing are increasingly linked in a zero-sum way in countries like Canada and Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Bryan Caplan suggests that his book "Build Baby Build" is a necessary sequel to his book "Open Borders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. However, for the U.S., where regulations are mostly local and vary widely, immigrants are already moving to places with lighter regulation, like Texas, where affordable housing is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Even with high immigration, it's better to let people in and accept some housing price increases than to restrict immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

When people complain that immigrants drive up prices, the solution is to allow the construction industry to build more homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Many of the workers building these homes would themselves be immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Historically, the U.S. coped well with modest levels of regulation for 50 years (from the 1920s when zoning took hold) because regulations weren't strict and there were many loopholes and places to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The argument is not necessarily for full deregulation before allowing immigration, but for keeping housing regulation modest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

### Addressing Criticisms of Immigration

Some arguments, such as those made by Angus Deaton, suggest that low-skilled immigration pushes down wages for domestic low-skilled workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. However, estimates of this effect are small at best, and there's debate on whether it might even go the other way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. This is because native and foreign low-skilled workers often have different skills (e.g., language skills), leading to specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. For instance, more low-skilled immigrants can lead to promotions for natives into supervisory roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

## Interplay and Challenges

### Density and Fertility

There's research suggesting an association between density and reduced fertility, with examples like Tokyo and Seoul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>. However, high density and high prices usually go hand-in-hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>, making it hard to disentangle the effects. It is difficult to find places with high density and cheap housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. Enabling cheaper suburban housing, which offers more space and makes it easier for young adults to move out of their parents' homes, is likely to increase fertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>. Living with parents, especially common in Southern and Eastern Europe, correlates with lower fertility due to social awkwardness regarding marriage and having children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>.

While societies generally become wealthier as fertility rates decline, housing is an area where progress has underperformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. Unlike other aspects of life where people often have more than their parents did at the same age, replicating parental housing situations is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. [[economic_factors_affecting_housing_affordability_in_australia | Deregulating housing]] is an "easier dial to shift" to encourage fertility, even if cultural changes also contribute to declining rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.

### Diminishing Returns and Agglomeration Gains

The idea that housing regulation protects the "weirdness" or innovativeness of communities like the Bay Area, and that deregulation would dilute it, is challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. Agglomeration gains are based on the total number of geniuses and innovators within driving distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. Adding lower-skilled workers would not mess up the mechanism unless they literally blocked roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>. Increased housing and population, including more low-skilled workers, could still increase total innovation by bringing more innovators into concentrated areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

While enabling more building in major cities might intensify economies of scale and productivity, which could immediately translate into higher rents and prices, it is still possible to keep building more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>. The supply of human talent is scarce, but the ability to construct buildings is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.

Early on, "low-hanging fruit" ideas are easier to discover, so smaller cities could produce significant innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. However, as the research frontier advances, it becomes harder to make progress, requiring more minds and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>. Therefore, larger agglomerations are needed for continued productivity growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>.

### Supply Skepticism and Politics

A significant proportion of Americans (30-40%) and Australians believe that a large increase in housing supply would cause prices and rents to *rise* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>. If this "supply skepticism" were true, homeowners would logically be "YIMBYs" (Yes In My Backyard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:50">[01:20:50]</a>. However, objective material self-interest has little to do with people's political views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:31">[01:21:31]</a>. Homeowners and tenants show similar resistance to deregulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>. Resistance to construction is often rooted in a general feeling that it would be "bad for human beings" or for society, rather than personal financial harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:45">[01:22:45]</a>.

At the state level, some "YIMBY" policies have been adopted, forcing localities to deregulate, especially in blue states like California, Oregon, and Minnesota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:21">[01:27:21]</a>. This often involves elites pushing for policies they believe are right, hoping that the long-term appreciation for lower housing prices will outweigh initial dissatisfaction with the policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:48">[01:28:48]</a>. The default preference is often for public housing, which sounds good, over private sector deregulation, despite public housing's limited supply and desirability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:35">[01:29:35]</a>.

The "YIMBY" movement is currently somewhat bipartisan, with left-wing activists in blue cities and red states that are "YIMBY by default" due to lighter regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:20">[01:32:20]</a>. It is more likely to become "left-coded" because its vocal activists tend to be left-wing and receive more media attention for advocating change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:10">[01:33:10]</a>.

## Long-Term View

In the very long run, human history might inevitably move towards a Coruscant-like planet where all available land mass is densified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:47">[01:42:47]</a>. Despite low fertility rates, life finds a way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:56">[01:42:56]</a>. Genetic variation in fertility and preference for children, combined with natural selection, suggests a future population that is highly pronatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:02">[01:43:02]</a>. With vastly increased populations, questions of where to put people will lead to extreme densification, potentially including settling Antarctica or even draining oceans for more land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:41">[01:44:41]</a>. This "bottleneck" of finding comfortably inhabitable planets at a reasonable cost is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:09">[01:45:09]</a>.

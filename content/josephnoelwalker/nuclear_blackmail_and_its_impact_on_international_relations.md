Nuclear blackmail is a significant concern in international relations, where a state threatens to use nuclear weapons to coerce another state into a specific action or inaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. The effectiveness of such a threat hinges on the target's belief in the threat's credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

## Credibility of Extended Nuclear Deterrence

[[credibility_of_american_extended_nuclear_deterrence | American extended nuclear deterrence]] provides a "nuclear umbrella" for allies, promising the use of U.S. nuclear weapons in their defense if they are threatened with nuclear attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This arrangement is designed to prevent allies from needing to develop their own nuclear arsenals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

However, the credibility of this deterrent has been questioned, particularly in scenarios where an adversary, such as North Korea, develops Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) capable of striking U.S. cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. In such a situation, the U.S. would be faced with the impossible choice of risking its own cities (e.g., Seattle or Los Angeles) to defend an ally (e.g., Seoul) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This is considered an unreasonable and incredible ask for American allies to make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Regional Dynamics and Proliferation

The waning credibility of [[credibility_of_american_extended_nuclear_deterrence | extended nuclear deterrence]] could lead to [[nuclear_proliferation_and_regional_security_dynamics_in_asia | proliferation]] in other regions. For example, if South Korea and Japan lose faith in the U.S. alliance or if American withdrawal seems imminent, they might consider acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Australia, being geographically further from China, is less likely to pursue nuclear weapons before these front-line states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Taiwan is considered unlikely to develop nuclear weapons due to its open society and the inability to keep such a program secret from Chinese intelligence, which would trigger an invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### The Indonesian Factor for Australia

For Australia to consider acquiring nuclear weapons, it would require Indonesia's acquiescence or, ideally, cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Without this, any problem solved by Australia going nuclear would be undercut by new, potentially worse problems created with Indonesia, which could become an adversary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## The Nuclear Taboo

A significant factor influencing the credibility of nuclear blackmail is the "culture against nuclear use" or the nuclear taboo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. This taboo makes the actual use of nuclear weapons incredibly difficult to break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. It is argued that a country like China would find it difficult to break this taboo against a smaller nation like Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

However, the efficacy of this taboo in preventing nuclear blackmail is debated. While a direct nuclear attack might be unthinkable, the threat of one could still be used to compel an adversary. Nuclear blackmail only works if the threat is believed, implying that the distinction between blackmail and actual use might be "without a difference" if the threat is considered credible enough to elicit a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

## Historical and Contemporary Examples of Nuclear Blackmail

*   **Ukraine and Russia:** Russia, particularly under President Putin, has repeatedly used nuclear blackmail to deter the U.S. and NATO allies from directly intervening in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
*   **U.S. and China (1950s):** In the 1950s, the U.S. successfully deterred China from invading Taiwan by threatening to use nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Political Will

In Australia, a Lowy Institute poll in 2022 indicated that approximately 36% of Australians either support or strongly support acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This result was surprising, especially given the historical anti-nuclear campaigns in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The lack of significant public reaction against [[implications_of_the_aukus_agreement_on_nuclear_power | AUKUS]]'s announcement of nuclear-powered submarines may suggest a shift in [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons | public opinion on nuclear weapons]] and [[australia_and_nuclear_power | nuclear power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. However, poll questions on complex issues like nuclear weapons often lack "counterfactuals" (e.g., associated costs or trade-offs), potentially leading to responses that are not fully thought through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Despite potential shifts in [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons | public opinion on nuclear weapons]], a fundamental cultural shift would be required for Australian governments to abandon reliance on [[credibility_of_american_extended_nuclear_deterrence | extended nuclear deterrence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. The U.S.-Australia alliance is deeply embedded in bureaucracies, intelligence sharing (e.g., Five Eyes), and the political culture of both major parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This deep integration makes a radical re-evaluation of the alliance and a move towards independent nuclear capabilities challenging for Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

## Conclusion

The potential for nuclear blackmail remains a serious concern in [[nuclear_proliferation_and_deterrence_in_asia | nuclear proliferation and deterrence in Asia]]. While the nuclear taboo offers a safeguard against actual use, the threat itself can be a powerful coercive tool. Nations like Australia face a complex dilemma: either continue to rely on the potentially waning [[credibility_of_american_extended_nuclear_deterrence | credibility of American extended nuclear deterrence]] and the nuclear taboo, or pursue independent nuclear capabilities, which would incur significant costs and risks, including potential destabilization of regional relationships.

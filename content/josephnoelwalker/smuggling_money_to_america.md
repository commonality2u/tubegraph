When emigrating from communist Hungary, individuals faced severe financial restrictions imposed by the government, necessitating alternative methods to acquire funds for their new life abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Financial Restrictions on Emigration from Communist Hungary

In 1985, under communist rule, the Hungarian government imposed strict limits on the amount of money citizens could take when leaving the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. For a family of three (two adults and a two-and-a-half-year-old child), only $100 was officially permitted: $50 for the child and $50 for one adult, with the expectation that the employer of the second adult would provide their funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. These [[restrictions_on_currency_and_movement_in_hungary | restrictions on currency and movement in Hungary]] were a deliberate attempt to limit movement and prevent defection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

Furthermore, the Hungarian currency was not convertible, meaning individuals could not freely exchange Hungarian for foreign currency like the U.S. dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. If foreign currency was obtained, it had to be surrendered to the bank in exchange for Hungarian currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Acquiring Funds for Departure

Given the strict financial limitations, prospective emigrants had to find unofficial means to secure additional funds. One method involved [[selling_items_on_the_black_market_for_survival | selling items on the black market for survival]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. An example of this was selling a Russian-made car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. While the car could be sold officially, the money from the sale had to be exchanged on the black market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This exchange typically occurred with foreign students, such as those from Arabic countries, who could provide foreign currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. In one instance, 800 British pounds were obtained, which was equivalent to approximately $1200 at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. While this practice was against the law, it was deemed a necessary measure for individuals to be able to leave the country with sufficient resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## The Smuggling Method

With the necessary foreign currency acquired, the next challenge was to smuggle it out of Hungary. A common and discreet method involved hiding the money within children's toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. For example, $1200 was wrapped and carefully stitched inside a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter's teddy bear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The child, being too young, was unaware of the money hidden within her toy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Emigrants had to remain vigilant at the airport to ensure the teddy bear or any other item containing smuggled money was not left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This act of smuggling was a common necessity, as many Hungarians leaving the country understood that $100 was insufficient to begin a new life in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

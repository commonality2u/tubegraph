The 2% inflation target, a common benchmark for central banks globally, is chosen as a "reasonable" level that is "not too close to zero and not too high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This target operates similarly to initial [[comparison_between_inflation_targets_and_capital_requirements | Basel Capital requirements]], which were set at 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Rationale Behind the 2% Target

At 2%, inflation is considered "noticeable" but generally "nobody really cares about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Studies suggest that inflation typically becomes a significant problem only when it reaches "double digits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, leaving "a lot of room between two and and double digits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

The primary concern with higher inflation is that it "can start getting a life of its own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, leading to [[consequences_of_higher_than_2_inflation | generalized inflation]]. At higher levels, "relative price movements become more absolute price movements," meaning that individual price increases (like oil prices) can trigger broader inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The goal is to maintain inflation "low enough that nobody really cares too much about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, which helps to anchor expectations around that level. This ensures that price movements are primarily "relative price movements" rather than overall absolute price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Importance of Consistency

While the specific number might seem arbitrary, its importance lies in its consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. It is more critical for the target to be low and consistently met than for the specific number itself to be perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### [[challenges_in_adjusting_inflation_targets | Challenges in Adjusting the Target]]

Adjusting the 2% target presents significant [[challenges_in_adjusting_inflation_targets | challenges in adjusting inflation targets]]. There is "never a good time to do that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>:
*   **When inflation is high:** If a central bank is "way above two" and proposes a new target of 4%, it could be perceived as "admitting defeat," implying an inability to return to the 2% goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **When inflation is low:** If inflation is "at two or below two" and a central bank proposes 4%, it seems "ridiculous" if it struggles to reach 2% in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### [[historical_context_of_inflation_targets_and_central_bank_policies | Historical Context]]

Prior to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve (FED) faced the opposite problem of having "too low inflation," averaging around 1.2% over the preceding decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. While the FED aimed to increase inflation, it chose not to raise its target to 4% when below 2% because it seemed illogical to propose a higher target when unable to meet the current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Instead, the FED altered its policy framework to be "a little more accommodating of inflation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Ultimately, the chosen target number matters less as long as it remains "below the radar screen of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

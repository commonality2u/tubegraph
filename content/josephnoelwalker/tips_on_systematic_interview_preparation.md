Systematic preparation for interviews, particularly for a podcast, involves an "extremely unusual process" that can be described as an "athlete of learning" along unusual axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This intensive approach is driven by a desire to engage with guests at a high level and elicit valuable, unique insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. The preparation often involves hundreds of hours of focused learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Overview of Preparation Phases

Preparation typically involves two phases:
1.  **Background/Lead-up Prep** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>: This non-intensive phase can involve months of work, such as studying textbooks with a private tutor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> and taking extensive courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. For one interview, this phase amounted to about 90 hours of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, and also includes years of being an "interested reader" of the guest's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
2.  **Intensive Prep Process** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>: This phase occurs one to three weeks before the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, involving 8 to 14 hours of reading per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This intensive period for one guest amounted to another 100 hours of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The total focused learning can reach 200 hours for a single interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

The entire learning process is motivated by the "extremely concrete thing" of conducting a conversation with "great excellence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Initial Preparation Strategy

### Orienting to the Material
When facing an "enormous pile of material," the first step is to seek advice on a syllabus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This involves speaking to professors or experts in the field to identify crucial textbooks and important topics to focus on, given time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The goal is to gain "a pretty decent undergraduate understanding" of the subject to furnish oneself with context for the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

The reading list is not static; it "evolves constantly on a day-by-day basis" during the intensive research sprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. New context gained each hour leads to a reconfiguration of priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. It's impossible to make a serious plan in advance, as the process "has to unfold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

## Deep Dive into Learning Methods

### Leveraging Tutors and Collaboration
Working with a private tutor is beneficial for mastering new fields, especially when there's a need to "master a sufficient amount of the field" that the guest's work sits within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Structured Study**: Tutors can work through textbooks, with both individuals reading independently and then coming together to solve practice problems on a whiteboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Problems can be worked on jointly, alternating when encountering obstacles, or separately with subsequent comparison of notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing Prerequisites**: Tutors can identify and address foundational knowledge gaps through "mini-lessons on the spot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, a process described as "prerequisite chaining" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This is a significant advantage over self-study, which might involve "floundering around on the Internet" or using large language models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

### Just-in-Time Learning
When encountering concepts or terms that are not thoroughly explained in primary sources, "just-in-time learning" is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. This involves:
*   **Quick Lookups**: Using search engines or LLMs to quickly look up definitions or clarify concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Prioritize looking it up yourself to avoid wasting someone's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.
*   **Seeking Expert Help**: Messaging friends or contacts with specific questions if self-lookup is insufficient or if the question itself feels "ill-posed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

### Effective Reading and Note-Taking
Reading is purposeful, aiming to extract specific information and clarify understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **Physical and Digital Reading**: Utilizing both physical books (for annotation and focus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a> and digital versions (preferably in an LLM wrapper for quick interrogation) simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   **Monitoring Understanding**: Actively monitoring comprehension is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. If something is not understood, it's looked up immediately because not understanding "is going to affect how well I understand the subsequent material" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>. However, it's also recognized that one cannot understand everything within time constraints, so a decision is made on what "seems important" to clarify versus what can be let go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.
*   **Note-Taking**: Handwritten notes are taken during tutoring sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. For book reading, physical "book tags" (Post-it notes) are used to mark important sections for later conversion into [[role_of_memory_prompts_in_learning | memory prompts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>, avoiding interruption of reading flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. Notes and questions that emerge while reading are typed into digital notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. Excerpts of neat distillations of important ideas are also captured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.

#### The Role of Memory Prompts
[[role_of_memory_prompts_in_learning | Memory prompts]] (flashcards) are a core component of the preparation process.
*   **Compounding Knowledge**: Prompts created for interviews years ago are leveraged for future interviews, making study more rewarding and "compounding over time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. This makes the learning "durable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a> and fosters enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>.
*   **Daily Retention and Efficiency**: During intensive sprints, reviewing prompts daily makes the next day's study easier by improving retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>. It's often humbling to realize how difficult it is to recall information just an hour or two after writing a prompt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>, reinforcing the value of the practice.
*   **Motivation and Feedback**: Daily review of prompts provides a "shorter feedback cycle" to the preparation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. Getting a high percentage of answers correct is "incredibly rewarding" and keeps the process motivating despite being solitary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>. It also creates a tangible output, showing progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.
*   **Prompt Writing**: The overarching meta-skill in prompt writing is "empathy for your future self" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a> to create prompts that are not too easy or too ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>. A key rule is "I won't write a prompt on something that I don't understand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>, with a minor exception for definitional things to pick up language even if the concept isn't fully grasped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>. Prompts are ideally revised on the spot if they are convoluted or unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>.

#### Managing Interview Questions
Questions for the guest are accumulated and structured, often in a digital Kanban board using a Markdown-backed plugin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   **Dumping Ground**: Initially, the Kanban board acts as a "Dumping Ground" for all potential questions and ideas, which can be messy with multiple versions of the same question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:18">[01:07:18]</a>.
*   **Categorization and Theming**: Questions are organized into columns based on different topics or themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. This thematic organization emerges as ideas form about "what are the most important kind of things to ask the person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:16">[01:06:16]</a>.
*   **Prioritization and Sequencing**: The Kanban board allows for easy reorganization of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>, which is crucial for establishing the "narrative Arc" and ensuring that premises are established for the audience to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>. Most aggressive organization happens one or two days before the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>.
*   **Meta-Notes**: Important reminders about interview technique or question limits are also kept on the Kanban board to remain visible and prompt constant consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.
*   **Physical Boards**: For some interviews, physical kanban boards are used with Post-it notes (e.g., yellow for ideas, pink for questions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:05">[01:26:05]</a>. This provides a "three-dimensional" operating space and is considered "superior in many ways" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:37">[01:25:37]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Interview Preparation

### Avoiding Pitfalls
Thorough preparation is vital to avoid appearing uninformed and to earn the guest's respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. Asking "silly or a waste of time" questions can cause the interviewer to "lose the guest's respect," which negatively impacts the rest of the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.
*   **Understanding Before Asking**: A key rule is: "if you don't understand the question, don't ask it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. Questions should be genuinely interesting and the interviewer must be "able to comprehend the answer" to engage in real conversation and ask follow-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:30">[01:22:30]</a>.
*   **Falsifying Preconceptions**: Part of preparation involves actively trying to "falsify" initial "preconceptions" and "juicy questions" to ensure they are well-founded and won't make the interviewer "look like a fool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.
*   **Beyond Surface-Level**: The goal is to ask "penetrating questions that they haven't been asked before" to encourage guests to "lean forward" and provide "some of the best answers they could give," including things not shared publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. One must "morally deserve those answers by putting in the work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.
*   **Interviewing as a Skill**: The preparation process is not just about learning a domain; it's also about learning "the art of interviewing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. This includes meta-learning about how to structure questions, engage with the guest, and deliver value to the audience by acting as a translator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. Reminders like "Don't Talk unless you can improve upon silence" are incorporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.

### Compounding Knowledge and Continuous Improvement
The knowledge gained from each interview preparation is intended to "continue and compound" for future interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. While intensive sprints focus on current guests, the long-term goal is for knowledge to grow durably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.
*   **Fixed Time, Flexible Scope**: The fixed time constraint (e.g., 200 hours) means that "flexible scope" is necessary, and "always always things will fall off the list" that cannot be fully covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:28:57]</a>.
*   **Prep as a Standalone Activity**: The preparation process itself is viewed as valuable "in and of itself apart from the podcast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>, as much of the extensive prep may not be visibly "useful" in the final interview, but still contributes to deep understanding and avoiding errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:55">[01:28:55]</a>.
*   **Efficiency for Impact**: Becoming more efficient with prep and compounding knowledge allows for more interviews, leading to a "bigger impact" and reaching "more people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:51]</a>.
*   **Sharing the Process**: There's an aspiration to share elements of the preparation process—including prompts, notes, and video recordings of work sessions or tutoring calls—to provide insight into how serious study and [[impact_of_thorough_preparation_on_interviews | thorough preparation]] unfolds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:25">[01:32:25]</a>. This aims to counter the "invisible" nature of knowledge work and study, showing that "this is what it looks like to read a book" and ensure understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:03">[01:37:03]</a>.

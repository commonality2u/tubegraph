## Early Efforts and Challenges

Beginning in 1989 at the University of Pennsylvania, the researcher, holding a non-tenure research assistant professor position, sought to establish their own laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. To secure funding, a grant proposal was submitted monthly for the first two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Despite these consistent efforts, none of the initial grant applications were successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Specific Rejections and Criticisms

A particular proposal in 1992 or 1993 focused on the use of [[research_on_circular_rna_and_related_experiments | circular RNA]], a concept which later gained recognition as novel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Despite working diligently to generate data for [[research_on_circular_rna_and_related_experiments | circular RNA]] experiments, this grant was also rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Perceived Issues with RNA Research

The feedback received often indicated that the data provided was insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Critics raised concerns that the [[mRNA_and_its_inflammatory_response | RNA]] was "label" (implying instability or unreliability) and thus would not be useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Questions on Researcher's Knowledge

Additionally, there were instances where the critics questioned the researcher's knowledge and capability to conduct the proposed experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Approach to Feedback and Improvement

Rather than viewing the rejections as a failure of the reviewers to understand the ideas, the researcher consistently listened to the feedback as an opportunity to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This involved:
*   Improving writing style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   Having colleagues review proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   Conducting more experiments to strengthen data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

> [!INFO] Researcher's Mindset
> "If I conclude that they don't understand, I have to say yes because maybe I did not explain well." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>

## Institutional Policy and Outcomes

The University of Pennsylvania had a policy stating that if a faculty member failed to establish themselves or secure external funding within five years, they would either need to be promoted or removed from the faculty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This policy ultimately led to the researcher's removal from the faculty in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

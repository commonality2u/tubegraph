Australia is facing a significant [[economic_factors_affecting_housing_affordability_in_australia | housing affordability crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:50">[03:51:50]</a>. This issue has been exacerbated by high levels of immigration over the past two decades interacting with an inelastic housing supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:50">[03:51:50]</a>. A primary driver of Australia's immigration policy since the late 1990s and early 2000s, including the 2001 changes that significantly increased skilled migrants and overseas students, was to slow the rate of population aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. This demographic objective accounted for approximately 80% of the motivation for these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## Supply-Side Solutions and Timeframes

Resolving the [[economic_factors_affecting_housing_affordability_in_australia | housing affordability crisis]] by focusing on increasing supply is a long-term endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

### Impact of Deregulation and Supply Targets
Complete liberalization of housing markets, including the removal of zoning regulations, heritage restrictions, and height restrictions, could lead to substantial reductions in housing prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Estimates suggest that increasing Australia's housing stock by 10% to 20% would be needed to achieve price falls of around 40% in cities like Sydney and Melbourne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

The National Cabinet's target of 1.2 million new homes over five years is considered a feasible short-term objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. This target represents an additional 200,000 homes above a baseline of 1 million homes, which was the previous peak in construction before the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Given Australia's national housing stock of 11 trillion homes, these 200,000 extra homes represent approximately a 2% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

As a general rule, every percentage point increase in the housing stock leads to about a 2.5% reduction in housing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Therefore, the National Cabinet's target of a 2% increment is expected to result in a 5% reduction in affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. It is important to note that this 5% reduction is relative to a counterfactual where house prices would otherwise continue to trend upwards, outpacing inflation by about 2.5% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. It does not mean prices will be 5% lower than today's prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

Achieving a 10% to 20% increase in the housing stock, which could lead to significant price falls, would take 10 to 20 years, even if it were implemented over and above current construction rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Such an aggressive [[policy_solutions_to_address_the_housing_crisis | policy solution]] is currently not considered realistic or on the political agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

### Political and Practical Challenges
The primary constraints to speeding up new supply are largely political <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. Housing has become a key means of wealth creation for the middle class in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Without an alternative vision for wealth creation, a supply-side agenda could entail a slow, decades-long process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

Current approaches, such as those in New South Wales and Victoria, involve setting higher targets for local councils to meet the 1.2 million homes objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. This requires local councils to approve more developments, such as blocks of flats in suburbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. However, there is concern that councils may resist these plans, leading to a conflict with state governments that may not have the political will to enforce targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Pre-announced automatic remedies for councils failing to meet targets are suggested to ensure compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

Increasing construction substantially will also require a significant increase in the construction industry's capacity, involving changes to training, immigration, accreditation, and wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. While other countries like Auckland have successfully doubled their construction workforce, this still takes time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Public backlash against new developments, often due to concerns about aesthetics or fear of change, also poses a challenge to increasing supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

## The Joint Problem of Housing and Productivity

The [[economic_factors_affecting_housing_affordability_in_australia | housing crisis]] creates compounding problems for [[housing_deregulation_and_productivity | productivity]] and fertility, leading to increasingly negative outcomes if left unaddressed for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

Improving [[housing_deregulation_and_productivity | national productivity]] is crucial for two reasons:
1.  To enable more people to afford to live and work in major urban centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
2.  To prepare the nation for potentially falling or lower house prices by ensuring rising incomes through stronger [[housing_deregulation_and_productivity | productivity growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

Australia's total factor productivity (TFP) generally sits around 80% of the US level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>, having peaked slightly above 85% in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Research from the late 1990s suggested that Australia could realistically aspire to reach 95% of US TFP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. The remaining 5% gap is attributed to factors like geographic isolation and the small size and fragmentation of the national market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. Closing this gap in TFP could mean significant improvements in Australia's economic performance and its ability to manage [[economic_factors_affecting_housing_affordability_in_australia | economic challenges]] like housing affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

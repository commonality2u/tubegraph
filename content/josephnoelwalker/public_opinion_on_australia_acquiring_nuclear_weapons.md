Recent polling data indicates a notable shift in [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons_in_australia | public opinion in Australia]] regarding the acquisition of nuclear weapons. A [[low_institute_poll_on_nuclear_weapons_support_in_australia | Low Institute poll]] conducted in 2022 revealed that approximately 36% of Australians either support or strongly support the country acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This figure was unexpected by some commentators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Impact of AUKUS and Nuclear Power

The surprising level of support is understood to be less surprising in the context of the [[impact_of_aukus_on_australias_stance_towards_nuclear_power | AUKUS announcement]] in August 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Historically, Australia has had a strong [[historical_perspective_on_antinuclear_sentiment_in_australia | anti-nuclear sentiment]], with active campaigns against nuclear power in the 1980s involving figures like Peter Garrett and groups like the Greens Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

However, after the Morrison government announced AUKUS in September 2021, the anticipated ramp-up of anti-nuclear campaigns did not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Despite opposition to AUKUS itself, there was no significant [[reactions_to_australias_potential_nuclear_developments | popular reaction]] against the idea of Australia potentially housing nuclear reactors in places like Sydney Harbour or HMAS Stirling in Western Australia, or building a new facility on the east coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This absence suggested that Australians were "more relaxed about nuclear power" than previously assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This relaxed attitude was seen as a positive sign for the opposition and contributed to their decision to include civilian nuclear power as an election promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Interpretation of Polling Results

One interpretation of the poll results suggests that [[polling_methods_and_interpretation_in_nuclear_weapons_surveys | poll questions]] are often presented without counterfactuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. For example, respondents are asked if they want nuclear weapons, but not if they would want them if it incurred specific costs or meant sacrificing other priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This leads to the conclusion that the simple answer might be that respondents "just haven't thought it through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

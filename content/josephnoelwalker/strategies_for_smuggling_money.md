During a period of emigration from communist Hungary in 1985, families faced severe restrictions on the amount of money they could take out of the country officially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. A family consisting of a husband, wife, and two-and-a-half-year-old daughter was only permitted to bring $50 for the daughter and $50 for the husband, with the expectation that the wife's employer would provide her funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This meager allowance of $100 for a small family was intended to limit movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Circumventing Currency Controls

To acquire more funds for their move to America, one family resorted to using the [[financial_struggles_and_black_market | black market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. They sold their Russian car officially and then exchanged the Hungarian currency on the [[financial_struggles_and_black_market | black market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This exchange involved students from Arabic countries, resulting in approximately $800 to $1,200 equivalent in pounds, as dollars were not available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

At the time, Hungarian currency was not convertible, meaning citizens could not freely exchange it for foreign currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. If foreign currency was acquired, it had to be turned over to the bank in exchange for Hungarian currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Possessing foreign currency was against the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Smuggling Method: Teddy Bears

With the additional funds, the family needed a method to smuggle the money out of Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The chosen strategy involved hiding the money inside their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter Susan's teddy bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The money was wrapped up, inserted into the teddy bear, and then the bear was stitched back together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The family had to ensure the bear was not left behind at the airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Susan, being too young, was unaware of the money hidden within her toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

This method of acquiring and smuggling extra money was common among Hungarians emigrating at the time, as it was understood that one could not arrive in America with only $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Introduction and Historical Context

[[australian_egalitarianism_and_its_historical_context | Egalitarianism]] has been a defining characteristic of Australian culture for at least the last 150 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This ethos crystallized into a national identity around the 1890s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, a period that paradoxically exhibited much higher economic inequality than today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Australia was characterized by stark social disparities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, with a higher share of people working as domestic servants than in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. By 1910, the top 1% of the population received 12% of all personal income, and the top 0.1% received 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Post-Federation Inequality Phases

The broad story of Australian inequality post-Federation follows two distinct phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>:
*   **Decline:** From the high points around Federation through to the 1970s, inequality fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Increase:** From the 1980s to today, inequality has risen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, approaching levels seen in the 1910s depending on the measurement used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Measuring Inequality

While the Gini coefficient and Atkinson indices are useful metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>, using top income or wealth shares offers advantages. This approach allows for data stretching back a century with annual figures, unlike sporadic survey data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. Furthermore, top income shares are easily understandable by the general public, facilitating public conversation around inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Empirically, various inequality metrics tend to move together with high correlations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

The Productivity Commission of Australia and Hilda data indicate that the Gini coefficient for disposable income in Australia has remained relatively flat for 35 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. However, income inequality, particularly among male earnings, did increase markedly from the 1940s through the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. While the Gini coefficient did rise during the 1980s and 1990s, it did not increase as much as in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>. Wealth inequality has increased over this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.

## [[factors_contributing_to_income_inequality | Drivers of Inequality Since the 1980s]]

Three major [[factors_contributing_to_income_inequality | factors contributing to income inequality]] since the 1980s have been identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>:

1.  **Technology and Globalization:** These forces have increased returns for "superstars" across various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. This has led to a widening gap in earnings, for example, between highly skilled lawyers serving international clients and those performing non-routine tasks like cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>.
2.  **Reduction in Union Membership:** Union membership declined from half the workforce in the early 1980s to about one in eight currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Unions historically played a massive and equalizing role in the labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.
3.  **Reductions in Top Tax Rates:** Lower top tax rates track strongly with increased inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. This is partly due to the mechanical effect of less tax revenue and partly because lower taxes incentivize more work and greater reinvestment of capital earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

### Education's Role in Counteracting Inequality

Australia's education boom, delayed by at least a generation compared to the US, helped prevent a larger increase in inequality during the computer revolution of the late 1990s and early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. The continuous increase in educational attainment through the 1990s and 2000s helped supply high-skilled workers to meet technology-driven demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

However, Australia has seen a [[decline_in_australias_educational_outcomes | decline in educational outcomes]] in terms of quality. Since mid-century, math and literacy scores have performed poorly, and PISA scores have deteriorated since the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. This decline is partly attributed to the end of rampant gender pay discrimination in other professions by the 1970s and 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. This discrimination had artificially funneled highly talented women into teaching and nursing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. When gender pay gaps narrowed, teaching wages did not significantly increase to continue attracting the same level of academic talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. As a result, the academic aptitude of new teachers has declined, correlating with a backward slide of half a year to a year in student achievement over the last few decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>.

### Market Concentration and Housing

Market concentration can drive inequality through monopolies (raising prices, transferring income from consumers to rich shareholders) and monopsonies (paying lower wages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>. The transfer from consumers to shareholders is considered a significant factor, as consumption is evenly distributed while shareholding is concentrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. While important, it's hard to empirically quantify its precise effect on inequality in Australia, and it may be less impactful than de-unionization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

The massive bull market in Australian housing over the last few decades has increased wealth inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. Wealth is more unequally distributed than income, and while housing wealth is less unequal than share market wealth, it is still substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:22">[00:37:22]</a>. The amount of time it takes for a typical Australian worker to buy a typical house has increased substantially, from four years after World War II to around 11 years today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>. This decline in [[challenges_and_strategies_in_addressing_housing_affordability_in_australia | housing affordability]] is a main driver of wealth inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>. Some analyses suggest that increases in the capital share of income largely boil down to housing, making it a critical focus for egalitarians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## Broader Perspectives on Inequality

### Global Inequality vs. National Inequality

While global inequality has fallen over the last few decades, largely due to economic growth in China and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>, inequality *within* countries has on average been growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>. Most people benchmark inequality against their fellow citizens within a nation, making national inequality the primary focus for researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>.

### Growth and Egalitarianism

There is often a perceived trade-off between growth and egalitarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>. However, many policies are "sweet spot" policies that benefit both growth and equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>:
*   Providing great educational opportunities to disadvantaged individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.
*   Promoting more competitive markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.
*   Creating opportunities for entrepreneurs from disadvantaged backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>.

### Impact of Artificial Intelligence

AI's impact on inequality is a concern, particularly regarding the potential for jobs to be automated faster than the labor market can adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a>. However, studies show that AI can have an equalizing effect within industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>. For example, in trials with management consultants and coders, AI improved performance by 20-40%, with the biggest gains seen among lower-performing workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. This contrasts with past technologies like computerization, which increased inequality within the labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.

To prepare for future automation, the best approach is to provide general skill building and higher levels of generalist education, allowing individuals to adapt to labor market shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:23">[01:08:23]</a>.

## Policy Considerations

Australia has a highly redistributive social safety net, providing 12 times more welfare to the bottom fifth of the distribution than to the top fifth, making it one of the most efficient in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. Key policy areas for advancing an egalitarian agenda include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>:
*   Maintaining the [[australian_egalitarianism_and_its_historical_context | egalitarian ethos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>.
*   Continuing to maintain the redistributive social safety net, including means testing and assets testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>.
*   Improving access for disadvantaged children to great teachers and ensuring teachers are appropriately remunerated and supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>.
*   Expanding opportunities for vocational training and university education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.
*   Attracting innovators from unconventional backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>.
*   Rigorously testing policies through methods like randomized trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.

The concept of a universal basic income (UBI) is debated. Australia's existing unemployment benefit already resembles a UBI more than other countries' systems due to its flat rate and enduring nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. However, a full UBI would be more fiscally challenging for Australia than for most countries, given its already highly redistributive safety net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. Experiments with UBI have shown more modest impacts than advocates suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>.

The decline in overall birth rates across all wealth levels in Australia does not appear to be a strong factor in wealth transfer and distribution changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>.

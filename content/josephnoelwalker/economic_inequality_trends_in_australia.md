The defining characteristic of Australian culture for at least the last 150 years has been its [[historical_egalitarianism_in_australia|egalitarianism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This ethos crystallized into a national identity around the 1890s, paradoxically a period of much higher economic inequality than today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The late 19th and early 20th centuries in Australia were marked by stark social disparities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. By 1910, the top 1% of the population received 12% of all personal income, and the top 0.1% received 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Historical Phases of Inequality

According to Andrew Leigh, the broad story of Australian inequality post-Federation falls into two distinct phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>:
*   **Decline (Federation to 1970s)**: From the highs at Federation through to the 1970s, inequality fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Rise (1980s to Today)**: From the 1980s to today, inequality has risen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. While current inequality is not quite as high as in the 1910s, it is "getting pretty close" depending on how it's measured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Measuring Inequality

Measuring inequality can be done in several ways:
*   **Top Income or Wealth Shares**: Andrew Leigh prefers focusing on top income or wealth shares because they can be estimated using tax data, allowing for analysis going back a century annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. These metrics are also considered easier for the public to understand compared to others like the Gini coefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. Empirically, many inequality metrics, including the Gini coefficient and top income shares, show very high correlations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Gini Coefficient**: The Gini coefficient measures inequality across the entire distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. Productivity Commission reports suggest the Gini coefficient for disposable income in Australia has been relatively flat for 35 years, with the Hilda survey showing similar stability since 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>. However, other data, such as male earnings and top income shares, show an increase in inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>.

## Drivers of Inequality Since the 1980s

Three major factors have driven pre-tax income inequality in Australia since the 1980s:
1.  **Technology and Globalization**: These have increased returns for "superstars" across various fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. An example is the increasing remuneration of lawyers as they served increasingly larger markets (Sydney, then Australian, then Asia-Pacific clients), while the wages of cleaners remained stagnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
2.  **Reduction in Union Membership**: Union membership declined from half the workforce in the early 1980s to about one in eight currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Unions previously played a significant role in fighting for better pay and conditions, particularly at the bottom of the income distribution, acting as an equalizing force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.
3.  **Reductions in Top Tax Rates**: These reductions track strongly with increased inequality, as lower taxes on dividend returns allow for more reinvestment and higher future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. There is also an effect where lower tax rates incentivize people to take on more work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Each of these three factors contributes about a third to the overall trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.

Other factors influencing inequality:
*   **Education**:[[decline_in_australian_high_school_test_scores|Australian education]] trends have a significant impact. The computer revolution of the late 1990s and early 2000s did not increase Australian inequality as much as American inequality because Australia's education boom was delayed and carried into the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. However, since mid-century, Australia has performed poorly on math and literacy scores, with PISA scores deteriorating since the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. This decline is partly attributed to the leveling of gender pay discrimination in other professions since the 1970s and 1980s, which previously funneled talented women into teaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.
*   **Market Concentration**: Monopolies can increase inequality by transferring income from consumers (broadly distributed) to shareholders (highly concentrated), and monopsonies can worsen it by paying workers lower wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>. Uncompetitive markets are detrimental to both growth and fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>.
*   **Housing Market**: The massive bull market in Australian housing has increased inequality because wealth is more unequally distributed than income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. The time it takes for a typical Australian worker to buy a typical house has risen from a low of four years after World War II to 11 years today, indicating that [[housing_affordability_crisis_in_australia|housing affordability]] is slipping out of reach for a growing share of Australians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>. Housing is a significant factor in the increasing capital share of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.
*   **Intergenerational Wealth Transfer**: While some hypothesize a relationship between birth rates and wealth distribution, research in Australia shows almost no difference in the number of children across households of different wealth or social backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>.

## Role of Policy and Government

Governments have significant influence over inequality:
*   **Taxation**: [[role_of_policy_and_taxation_in_reducing_inequality|Reductions in top tax rates]] have contributed to rising inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
*   **Social Safety Net**: Australia's social safety net is the most redistributive in the world, giving 12 times more welfare to someone in the bottom fifth of the distribution compared to the top fifth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>. Maintaining this means-tested and asset-tested system is considered vital for efficient redistribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>. While this leads to high effective tax rates for some, the behavioral impact is limited as people generally respond more to visible tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>.
*   **Education**: Creating more educational opportunities (TAFE, university) and ensuring quality across all schools is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. Attracting and retaining the best teachers, appropriately remunerating them, and reducing paperwork burdens are important for improving educational quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.
*   **Innovation**: Policies that foster innovation by supporting entrepreneurs from disadvantaged backgrounds are seen as beneficial for both growth and equality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>.
*   **Policy Evaluation**: Rigorously testing policies through randomized trials is crucial to ensure they are effective in advancing an egalitarian agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

*   **Impact of AI**: While AI could potentially automate many jobs, potentially happening faster than the labor market can adjust, some studies suggest AI might have an equalizing effect within industries. Randomized trials show that AI use can improve performance for management consultants (20-40% better) and coders (20% better), with the biggest gains often seen in lower-performing workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Global vs. National Inequality**: Global inequality has been falling due to rapid economic growth in populous countries like China and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. However, inequality *within* countries has, on average, been growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>. The focus remains on national inequality as people benchmark themselves against fellow citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>.
*   **Growth vs. Equality**: It's argued that policies often exist that can improve both economic growth and equality simultaneously, rather than a strict trade-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.
*   **Factors Beyond Government Control**: Macro-level trends like globalization and technological shocks, along with historical events like wars and famines, also have massive impacts on inequality, suggesting that government policies are not the sole determinants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:14">[01:26:14]</a>. For example, the top 1% income share in five Anglo-Saxon countries (Australia, New Zealand, UK, US, Canada) followed a similar "big U shape" across the 20th century despite different political leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:30">[01:25:30]</a>.

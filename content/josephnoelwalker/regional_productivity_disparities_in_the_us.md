The concept of [[impact_of_housing_deregulation_on_productivity | housing deregulation]] leading to significant [[productivity_gains_from_urbanization | productivity gains]] within a country can be understood by first considering the economic case for immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Just as international immigration allows individuals to move from low-productivity countries to high-productivity ones, internal migration within a country ideally allows people to move to areas where their skills yield higher productivity and wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Historical Internal Migration in the US

Historically, there were no legal limitations on internal movement within the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This led to significant internal migration, as people from "backwards, low wage places" moved to more advanced areas to earn higher wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This phenomenon, which represents [[historical_migration_trends_in_the_us | historical migration trends in the US]], was very common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Both low and high-skilled workers traditionally moved from low-wage regions, particularly the US South, to high-wage areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. A notable example is the massive population movement to California during the 1940s, 50s, 60s, and 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. For most people, these moves were successful, leading to higher-paying jobs and improved living conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

The economic motivation for such internal migration was straightforward: individuals earned higher pay in the destination area because their productivity was higher there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Higher productivity could stem from factors such as advanced technology, better management practices, or more fertile land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Modern Trends and Challenges

Despite the historical patterns, the modern US exhibits a peculiar trend: large gaps in measured productivity persist between major regions, but internal mobility has significantly declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Research by economists Ganong and Shoag reveals a shift in migration patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>:
*   **High-skilled workers** still tend to move from low-productivity areas to high-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Low-skilled workers**, however, are increasingly moving in reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. They are leaving high-wage areas like San Francisco for lower-wage areas in states such as Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### The Role of Housing Costs

The primary driver for this reversal in low-skilled worker migration is the enormous cost of housing in high-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. For many, particularly those with lower skills, the percentage wage gains in these productive regions do not outweigh the increased housing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Workers prioritize their overall standard of living, which is calculated as wages minus the cost of living, with housing being the most significant component of that cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

Historically, before stricter regulations, there was little difference in housing costs between high and low-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This allowed workers of all skill levels to move to places where their wages were higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Potential Productivity Gains

Restoring reasonable housing costs in high-wage areas, potentially through [[impact_of_housing_deregulation_on_productivity | housing deregulation]], would likely re-establish the traditional pattern of internal migration across all skill levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. While the productivity gains from internal migration might not be as dramatic as those from international immigration (which can multiply wages by a factor of 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, they would still be substantial. Productivity differences between regions like the Bay Area and the rural South are significant enough to suggest a considerable increase in mobility if housing were more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

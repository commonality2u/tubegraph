Initial research aimed to create therapeutic protein-coding RNA without inflammatory molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This led to questions about why synthetic RNA was inflammatory compared to RNA found inside cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Understanding RNA Immunogenicity

It was hypothesized that synthetic RNA caused inflammation because it was introduced from outside to [[understanding_immune_response_to_rna | immune cells]], where RNA is not typically found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The initial goal was not to create non-immunogenic RNA, but rather to understand if synthetically produced RNA differed in its [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | immune response]] from RNA found within cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

The investigative approach involved isolating RNA from human cells and comparing its [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | immune response]] on human dendritic cells to that of *in vitro* synthesized RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Researchers initially expected all RNA to trigger an [[understanding_immune_response_to_rna | immune response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Discovery of Non-Immunogenic Transfer RNA

During these experiments, various types of RNA were tested, including bacterial Transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Surprisingly, Transfer RNA did not induce any [[understanding_immune_response_to_rna | immune response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

This observation led to the hypothesis that the [[role_of_rna_and_its_immunogenicity | non-immunogenic]] nature of Transfer RNA might be due to its well-known characteristic of containing the most modified nucleosides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Most other RNA tested did induce an [[understanding_immune_response_to_rna | immune response]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. While RNA inside the body's cells is typically not inflammatory, injury can cause its release, leading to an inflammatory reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The next challenge following this discovery was to prove that these nucleoside modifications were indeed responsible for the lack of immunogenicity, and to learn how to produce RNA containing such modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

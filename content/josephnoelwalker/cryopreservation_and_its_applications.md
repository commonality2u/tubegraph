## Introduction
Laura Deming, co-founder and CEO of Cradle, a startup focused on human whole-body reversible [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreservation]], also serves as a venture capitalist investing in anti-aging and [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | life extension technologies]] [00:00:08]. She founded The Longevity Fund, which has since been superseded by Age One, where she is a co-founder and partner [00:00:22].

## Philosophical and Sociopolitical Implications of Longevity
The philosophical implications of longevity are a significant concern, influencing how [[communicating_and_investing_in_longevity_science | capital is allocated]] today [00:01:17]. Many people hold subconscious beliefs about these topics that guide investment intuitions, which in turn determine what technologies become available in the future [00:03:26].

A central question in the realm of transhumanism and human interaction technology is what aspects of personal identity one wishes to preserve over time [00:02:08]. There is no universally agreed-upon "right answer" from either Eastern or Western philosophy [00:02:20]. While arguments for physical continuity can be reconstructed, they differ significantly from an intuitive need to survive [00:02:47].

The concept of [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | longevity]] poses a question: if individuals are merely a "web of experiences shifting through time" (Derek Parfit's bundle theory) [00:01:29], how should this affect one's thinking about [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | longevity]] [00:01:34]? It becomes a subjective choice of what to preserve [00:02:01].

### Evolution of Perspective on Longevity
Laura Deming's emotional connection to [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | longevity]] has evolved [00:05:23]. While she once felt a "fiery zeal" to fix the problem of aging, she now appreciates a "very real and very valid piece of wisdom" in not thinking about this problem [00:05:34]. Grappling with metaphysical questions constantly can cause "extreme mental anguish" [00:06:40].

However, she still believes it is "incorrect not to work on [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | longevity]] drugs" because they are simply a type of medicine aimed at providing a more healthy year, similar to exercise [00:07:19]. The opposition to thinking about [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | longevity]] often stems from a deep wisdom about living a good life [00:07:41].

### The Teleporter Thought Experiment and Shared Experience
The "teleporter" thought experiment (creating a copy at a destination and destroying the original) highlights different views on what is valued [00:09:11]. If one would use the teleporter, their concern might shift from personal physical continuity to preserving values, identity, or simply the continued existence of people similar to them [00:09:31]. In such a scenario, one might feel equally content if "the population at whole is still around" rather than specifically their own conscious entity [00:09:59].

However, [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | longevity]] could allow conscious entities to evolve over much longer periods, leading to a kind of beauty in conscious experience not seen with shortened lifespans [01:10:07].

### Transhumanism: Towards a More Humane Vision
Laura Deming seeks a "more humane transhumanism" [00:10:36]. Traditional transhumanist manifestos often focus on gaining power and the drive to survive, feeling "incomplete" and "not inspiring" [00:11:27]. They also appear "way too confident" in predicting technological changes [00:11:56].

She is interested in versions of transhumanism that are "more oriented towards the former [populations] and like kind of less centered around the latter [individuals]" [00:12:19]. The aim is to imagine transformations that are hard to predict, rather than individuals changing in predictable ways [00:12:05]. This involves conceiving of futures that are "very different from our own," which sci-fi authors often avoid due to relatability concerns [01:06:06].

She finds a "humane transhumanist vision" vaguely captured in Rainer Maria Rilke's *Duino Elegies*, which explores an individual's struggle to connect with a dimly perceived, higher level of understanding or experience, metaphorically referred to as "angels" [01:14:31]. This resonates with the idea of humans trying to become something they cannot yet fully understand, like a 2D object attempting to become 3D [01:15:58].

### Societal Changes with Extended Lifespans
With average human lifespans and healthspans potentially extending to 150-200 years [00:17:55], non-obvious societal changes could emerge:
*   **Artistic and Intellectual Evolution:** Artists and thinkers could spend their entire lives developing their craft, potentially leading to profound and original works [00:20:05]. The painter of *The Great Wave off Kanagawa* felt he was only beginning to learn how to draw in his 60s or 70s, wishing he could live to 100 to truly draw living things [00:19:24]. This illustrates the potential for long-term evolution of a conscious entity [00:20:20].
*   **Game Theory of Society:** In game theory, cooperation becomes advantageous when agents play an unknown and potentially very long number of rounds [00:21:11]. Extended lifespans could incentivize more pro-social behavior due to individuals expecting to interact with society for much longer periods [00:21:32].
*   **Economic Inequality:** A negative consequence could be increased capital compounding for the first generations to experience significantly extended lifespans, leading to new forms of inequality where being born earlier becomes an advantage [00:22:04]. This might necessitate new societal structures or wealth taxation [00:22:31].
*   **Societal Dynamism:** Concerns exist that extended lifespans could lead to a less dynamic society if individuals, shaped by their youthful formative experiences, remain in positions of power for longer, hindering generational turnover and shifts in worldview [00:26:10]. However, society already sees shifts in cultural dominance (e.g., music styles) even without radical lifespan extension, suggesting that change can still occur [00:28:41].

It is crucial that extended lifespans also mean robust health, vigor, and cognitive plasticity, not just mere existence [00:23:10]. Maintaining creativity and adaptability, rather than "stultification in thinking," is essential [00:24:04]. This circles back to the question of what aspects of personal identity one wishes to preserve over time, including an openness to change and growth [00:24:45].

## Metascientific Questions
### Scientific Awe and Its Cultivation
Laura Deming emphasizes the importance of joy and awe in science and scientific discovery [00:29:40]. She believes it is possible to train the ability to feel scientific awe [00:29:54].

For her, scientific awe can be conjured on demand through specific practices:
*   Being in a grassy, open environment [00:33:08].
*   Having music playing [00:33:12].
*   Having recently eaten sugar [00:33:13].
*   Having a set of "mental objects" that are sufficiently developed for interaction, such as concepts in cell biology [00:33:15].
*   Inspired by Einstein's early education, which involved visceral, intuitive exercises to develop an understanding of quantity [00:33:30].

She has optimized her life to spend an enormous amount of time in this state, totaling 512 hours since 2018 [00:34:20]. This state feels tied to a sense of truth and connection with the "laws of the universe" [00:36:44]. She values it intrinsically, not just for functional reasons [00:37:16].

### Embodied Thinking in Science
A key [[tools_for_learning_and_memory | tool for learning and memory]] and generating awe is "embodied thinking," particularly imagining oneself inside a cell [00:38:06]. This involves combining scientific knowledge with the feeling of being in an imaginary world, allowing the mind to track physical laws and explore how the cell would behave [00:38:38]. This "magic" allows for discovery by pushing the simulated world and observing its realistic response [00:39:07].

This requires a robust understanding of molecular biology laws, but it can be approached with "toys in mathematics," simple models that can be poked and pushed to reveal complexity [00:39:51]. An example is the "powers of 10" exercise, mentally scaling down from an arm to a hand, to a thumb, eventually reaching the size of an atom [00:40:42]. This method helps visualize logarithmic scales and navigate different levels of reality [00:41:42].

This embodied thinking has provided [[ai_applications_in_economic_policy_making | scientific insights]], particularly in understanding [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreservation]] [00:42:33]. It revealed the counter-intuitive fact that cells, unlike human-built factories, are incredibly robust to the randomization of molecular motion induced by cooling to very low temperatures [00:43:39]. This is because cells primarily operate on [[invariance_of_cells_to_environmental_changes | passive diffusion]], where molecules already move in random directions, making them inherently invariant to the physical changes of cooling [00:44:18].

Biology and physics are seen as particularly amenable to this mode of thinking, as they allow for the use of "3D everyday intuitions" at different scales or with different rules [00:46:26]. Mathematics, however, feels more "foreign" and less intuitive in this regard [00:46:40].

### Scientific Mentorship
Laura Deming's experience in Cynthia Kenyon's lab at age 12 was formative [00:47:30]. Cynthia Kenyon was an extraordinary mentor who exhibited bravery by believing in ideas before others and treating Deming seriously as an intellectual, providing advanced projects [00:48:33]. This experience instilled self-confidence and may have shaped Deming's own approach to mentorship [00:50:32].

For Laura Deming, effective mentorship involves seeing "something beautiful inside" the mentee and helping that beauty grow from the outside, rather than actively directing them [00:51:43]. This is often tied to an appreciation for authenticity, deep care, and love for ideas in others [00:52:02].

She notes that Silicon Valley's "industry town" culture can stifle creativity, especially for young founders who are aggressively trained to appear competent and trustworthy for fundraising, potentially leading them to sacrifice originality [00:52:43].

## Cryopreservation: A Deep Dive
### Rationale for Focusing on Cryopreservation
Despite a broad view of [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | longevity]] technologies, Laura Deming chose to focus on [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreservation]] due to its unique characteristics [01:09:14]:
*   **Impactful:** Fully solving medical hibernation could bridge the gap to future therapies for terminal illnesses, essentially acting as a "one-way time machine" to access future medical advancements [01:10:35].
*   **Technically Tractable:** While experimental, it is a problem where engineering and physics can deeply interface, allowing for rapid development of new solutions by leveraging the full spectrum of physical ideas [01:12:06].
*   **Underworked On:** Compared to its potential impact and tractability, [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreservation]] is significantly underworked on, often because it is perceived as "too weird" or carries a lot of "baggage" that creates a "force field" around the field [01:12:38].

[[cryopreservation_techniques | Cryopreservation]] belongs to the "pausing" category of aging interventions, which she believes is more straightforward and fully defined as a single problem compared to restoring, replacing, or delaying aging [01:13:28]. It offers more opportunities to apply tools from physics and engineering with significant leverage [01:14:05].

### The Uniqueness of Cells in Cryopreservation
The ability to [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreserve]] and rewarm biological material is "incredibly strange" because it essentially randomizes the molecular motion within cells at very low temperatures [01:13:09]. Most human-built systems are incompatible with such randomization [01:13:51].

However, cells are "invariant" to this kind of randomization [[invariance_of_cells_to_environmental_changes | because they evolved to run on passive diffusion]] [01:14:01]. The internal workings of a cell are structured around molecules "bouncing about in random directions," meaning nothing is guaranteed to be in a particular place unless strongly bonded [01:14:22]. This fundamental difference from how humans design objects makes [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreservation]] possible for cells [01:14:50].

### Challenges and Future Directions
### Regulatory Bottlenecks
To reduce regulatory bottlenecks for [[emerging_technologies_in_life_extension | longevity]] drugs, the FDA could lay the groundwork for "aging as an indication" [01:13:30]. Most importantly, shortening review cycles from six months to a couple of weeks for preclinical companies would significantly reduce timeline uncertainty and iteration time [01:13:45].

### Nature of Aging
The field is grappling with whether aging is primarily the result of noise and randomness or programmed/quasi-programmed patterns [01:14:55]. It is a "strange but true fact" that single gene changes in many organisms can significantly alter lifespan, sometimes by insane multiples in small organisms (e.g., 2x to 6x lifespan extension in C. elegans, around 60% in mice) [01:15:13]. This suggests a non-zero, controllable programmatic component to aging, which is surprising given the immense complexity of biological systems [01:15:54]. The prior assumption is usually that aging is a system breaking down randomly, making simple interventions with profound effects seem counter-intuitive [01:16:10].

### Investment Patterns
The Longevity Fund, and its successor Age One, have observed that successful portfolio companies are primarily "founder oriented" and pursuing "moonshot ideas" [01:13:38]. This focus reflects the fund's understanding and strategy [01:13:52].

### Public Communication Challenges
Public communication for [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreservation]] is "incredibly complicated" and "anti-mimetic" [01:15:06]. There are reasons why it's underworked on that cannot be publicly discussed, as revealing them would undermine the very "force field" that shields the field [01:15:11]. Additionally, there's an intuitive dislike for the idea of "cold things" or "freezing," which adds another layer of resistance [01:16:03]. The concept of [[cryopreservation_techniques | cryopreservation]] runs counter to many human intuitions [01:16:28].

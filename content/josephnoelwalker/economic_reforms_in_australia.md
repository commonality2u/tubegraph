From: [[josephnoelwalker]] <br/> 

Australia's last major economic reform occurred in 2000 with the introduction of a consumption tax (GST) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. For 25 years since, there have been no significant new improvements to the system, despite a desperate need for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Over the past two decades, productivity growth has stagnated or fallen, resulting in a slowdown of real GDP per person growth, a key measure of living standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Historical Context and Key Figures
Ken Henry, a prominent figure in Australian economic policy, led the implementation of the GST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. He also worked in Treasury and Paul Keating's office during Australia's "golden era of economic reform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> and served as Treasury Secretary for approximately a decade from 2001 to 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. During his tenure, he led the Henry Review of Australia's tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> and helped Australia avoid recession during the global financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Technological Evolution and its Impact on Governance
Discussions on economic reform also touch upon the profound impact of technology on government and policy-making.

### From Typist Pools to Spreadsheets
When Ken Henry joined Treasury in 1984, typist pools were common, with individuals spending their entire working days typing documents and making duplicates for filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. His first introduction to spreadsheets came at the end of 1984, where he witnessed Lotus 123's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. He was "blown away" when he could build a computable general equilibrium model in about two hours using Lotus 123, a task that previously took a month with punch cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Treasury was reportedly the first user of Microsoft Excel in Canberra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, with its power proving instrumental in modeling changes to the indirect tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Henry believes that without this capability, the consumption tax would "absolutely no way" have been introduced in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### The Internet and Policy-Making
The internet's introduction to government faced initial security restrictions, preventing Treasury staff from accessing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Despite misuse problems, the internet is considered one of humanity's greatest inventions due to its ability to provide instant access to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

The dynamic between ministers and the public service has shifted, with ministers potentially researching topics themselves before consulting officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. However, ministers prefer to receive information in specific forms, such as oral exchanges or graphic presentations, rather than wading through extensive text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This preference is often driven by how they imagine communicating the information to a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

### Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Governance
The potential of powerful AI systems to act as "agents" capable of complex cognitive tasks raises fundamental questions about the future of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Ken Henry questions whether there would be a need for ministers or politicians in a future dominated by advanced AI, suggesting that AI theorists even contemplate a future without a judiciary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

Key concerns regarding AI's impact on policy-making include:
*   **Speed vs. Quality**: Increased speed in producing "impeccably researched briefs" might lead to a decline in policy quality if politicians become more cautious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>, as Henry observes that "the more they know the less courageous they are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.
*   **Human Accountability**: Ministers will likely continue to value human accountability, preferring advice from someone they can "tell off" or to whom they can explain political realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. They also want to keep their own motivations private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   **Ethics and Morality**: AI agents, while super-smart, cannot be trusted with moral or ethical decisions, as they lack human characteristics like irrationality or randomness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. The role of human leaders might shift to bearing responsibility for morality and ethics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.
*   **Checks and Balances**: The potential for AI to displace most human roles in government underscores the importance of retaining human checks and balances and the separation of powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.
*   **Job Displacement**: While technology historically made humans more productive, advanced AI (AGI) explicitly targets higher-level cognitive abilities, raising fears of job displacement on a large scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. Henry notes that the public service has already seen a shift from 50% of staff in the lowest two bands (APS 1-2) in the 1980s to about 5% today, largely due to automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.
*   **Economic Impact**: A major concern is that AI could lead to a production process that no longer provides a secure income for most people, concentrating wealth among a few AGI service providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>. This challenges traditional economic models where income from production drives consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

The government is already contemplating new forms of taxation for income redistribution, partly due to the increasing difficulty of taxing the mobile and extranational income tax base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.

## Unfinished Business in Tax Reform

Ken Henry highlights areas of the tax system requiring further reform:
*   **Company Income Tax**: The structure of Australia's company income tax system remains "unfinished work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>, with options like an Allowance for Corporate Equity (ACE) needing consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   **Road User Charging**: A comprehensive road user charging scheme, including a carbon component, should replace fuel excise, motor vehicle registration fees, driver's license fees, and stamp duties on motor vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>. This policy was proposed 15 years ago and had industry support but remains unimplemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.
*   **Personal Income Tax and Fiscal Drag**: Henry now advocates for indexing personal income tax scales, a stance he previously argued against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>. He believes the government's reliance on "fiscal drag" (where inflation pushes wages into higher tax brackets, increasing average tax rates even when real wages fall) undermines social cohesion and intergenerational harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. This contributes to the perception that young people are being "robbed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>.
*   **Capital vs. Labor Income Taxation**: The argument for lower taxation on capital income, which is often double-taxed, has contributed to a system where capital income and capital gains are "much more favorably taxed" than labor income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>.
*   **Intergenerational Equity**: Henry is most concerned about [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | intergenerational equity]], specifically the burden on young people due to fiscal drag, housing affordability issues (like the [[causes_of_the_housing_crisis_in_australia | housing crisis]]), and student debt (HEX debt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>. He argues that policies have not addressed these concerns, despite being highlighted in intergenerational reports since 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>.
*   **Vertical Fiscal Imbalance**: Australia needs a comprehensive review of Commonwealth-State roles and responsibilities, starting with expenditure side of the budget, to clarify overlapping complexities in areas like age care, child care, and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>. This would then inform a discussion about allocating tax bases between different levels of government, addressing economically "egregious" state taxes like stamp duties and insurance taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:22">[02:07:22]</a>.

## Productivity and Population Growth

Australia's productivity levels typically sit around 80% of the US level, with geographic factors potentially limiting it to about 95% of the technological frontier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:30">[01:22:30]</a>.

### Drivers of Productivity
Productivity growth is driven by two main factors:
1.  **Capital Deepening**: Augmenting labor with capital assistance (including AI) makes work more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26">[01:24:26]</a>. Australia has experienced "capital shallowing" in the last decade due to a collapse in the investment rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:09">[01:25:09]</a>.
2.  **Multifactor Productivity Growth**: This "residual" factor involves finding new, smarter ways of doing things, even if it's less understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:24">[01:26:24]</a>.

Australia needs to focus on creating an environment conducive to technological innovation that can be commercialized domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07">[01:37:07]</a>. Henry provides examples of missed opportunities, such as the lack of processing of critical minerals in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36">[01:29:36]</a> and the import of engineered wood products despite domestic forestry resources and chemical engineering expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>. He argues against the "mindset" that Australia's only comparative advantage is exporting raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:56">[01:32:56]</a>, drawing parallels with Singapore's ability to create factors of production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:04">[01:34:04]</a>.

### Population and Urban Planning
Australia's reliance on high population growth through net migration to address stagnant productivity and rising dependency ratios has led to secondary consequences, particularly for [[causes_of_the_housing_crisis_in_australia | housing affordability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. Henry recalls advising Kevin Rudd in 2007 that Australia's sustainable population was about 15 million, not 50 million, given current policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.

He advocates for a "spatial lens" in population policy, suggesting a vision for new cities rather than concentrating growth in existing major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>. For example, instead of Sydney and Melbourne growing to 8 million, building new cities of 10 million people in presently uninhabited areas or 10 cities of 1 million along the Sydney-Melbourne corridor, supported by infrastructure like high-speed rail, could be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>. This contrasts with the traditional economic reluctance to central planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>. Port Macquarie is cited as an example of successful regional growth driven by strategic investment in infrastructure, such as a new hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>.

### Fertility Rates
Henry acknowledges that policy levers can influence the total fertility rate, citing the success of the "baby bonus" in increasing births <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:12">[01:19:12]</a>. However, he also notes that to reach replacement rate (around 2.1) and minimize the dependency ratio, much more substantial support for families, including childcare, would be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.

## The End of the Reform Era

Australia experienced a period of ambitious economic reforms from 1983 to 2000, followed by 25 years of "comparatively lackluster reform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:41">[01:38:41]</a>.

### Explanations for the Stagnation
Ken Henry identifies several contributing factors:
*   **Complacency and the Mining Myth**: A significant factor is complacency, underpinned by the "mining myth" that Australia's prosperity is solely due to mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:59">[01:43:59]</a>. The terms of trade have remained at high levels since late 2002, fostering a false sense of security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:30">[01:44:30]</a>.
*   **Lack of Political Courage and Ambition**: Political leaders seem to lack the ambition to pursue difficult but necessary reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:07">[01:45:07]</a>, with some even dismissing the concept of a "legacy" as a "vanity project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:34">[01:49:34]</a>. This contrasts with figures like Paul Keating, who sought to demonstrate national leadership through economic reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:27">[01:45:27]</a>, and John Howard, who undertook the risky GST reform to prove himself as a reformist leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:28">[01:48:28]</a>.
*   **Small Target Strategy**: The "small target strategy" adopted by political parties, coupled with the belief that a policy proposal must have an electoral mandate from prior election campaigns, leads to "nothing" being achieved once in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:03">[01:28:03]</a>.
*   **Opposition from Interest Groups**: The [[benthamite_influence_on_australian_political_institutions | influence of interest groups]] is strong, as seen with the mining tax. Despite its economic rationale (addressing "crowding out" caused by the mining boom), a simple, misleading narrative ("killing the goose that's laying the golden eggs") successfully derailed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>.
*   **Absence of a "Burning Platform"**: Major economic reforms in Australia have historically been triggered by a "burning platform" narrative, such as Keating's "Banana Republic" statement in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:22">[02:01:22]</a>. Henry now believes such a crisis or manufactured sense of urgency is "absolutely indispensable" for motivating action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:19">[02:02:19]</a>. His recent focus on [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | intergenerational equity]] aims to help create such a platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:22">[02:03:22]</a>.
*   **Media and Political Changes**: While some blame social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>, the influence of news polls and the professionalization of politics may also play a role. The decline in major party support and increase in swing voters can reduce political capital for reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:51">[01:42:51]</a>.
*   **Public Service**: It's not a lack of cognitive skills in the public service limiting policy development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:15">[02:26:15]</a>; rather, the "elegance" of some policy proposals (like the Henry Review's 1000-page report) can make them *less* likely to be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:37">[02:26:37]</a>.

Despite these challenges, Henry believes Australians want to see politicians "do big things" and be taken "on the journey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:30">[02:52:30]</a>.

### Qualities of an Effective Senior Public Servant
To be an effective senior public servant, one must be:
*   **Trusted**: Building and retaining trust is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:04">[02:13:04]</a>.
*   **Technically Expert**: This expertise is crucial for commanding trust and providing valuable advice, as an AI could otherwise replace them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:19">[02:14:19]</a>.
*   **Collaborative**: Ability to work effectively with colleagues across government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:06">[02:15:06]</a>, acting as a "helper" rather than a "Dr. No" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:26">[02:15:26]</a>.
*   **Team Leader**: Capable of creating and leading "highly effective teams of highly motivated people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:58">[02:15:58]</a>.
*   **Comfortable with Ambiguity**: The ability to navigate uncertainty and lack of clear boundaries is essential to avoid burnout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:33">[02:16:33]</a>.

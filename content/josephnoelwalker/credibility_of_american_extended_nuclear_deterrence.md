American extended nuclear deterrence, often referred to as the nuclear umbrella, is a fundamental agreement between the United States and its allies. This arrangement dictates that if an ally, such as South Korea, Japan, or Australia, is threatened with nuclear weapons, the U.S. will respond with its own nuclear arsenal in defense [00:06:27]. This bargain is designed to prevent these allies from feeling the need to develop their own nuclear weapons [00:06:47].

## The Fading Credibility of Extended Nuclear Deterrence

The credibility of this deterrence is increasingly questioned, particularly in light of evolving threats. The concern arises because the U.S. commits to using its nuclear weapons on an ally's behalf, even if it means risking American cities [00:07:31].

### The Korean Case

A significant illustration of this dilemma is the situation with South Korea. North Korea's development of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of carrying nuclear warheads to American cities, such as New York or Los Angeles, fundamentally alters the deterrence bargain [00:07:07]. The implied trade-off—sacrificing an American city for Seoul—is seen as an impossible ask, rendering the extended deterrence "not credible" [00:07:44]. This assessment is not a judgment on American moral character or courage, but a "coldblooded assessment about its vital interests" [00:08:09].

South Korea's response to this waning credibility has been to develop more independent capabilities to counter the North Korean threat [00:09:00]. In contrast, Australia and Japan have chosen to strengthen their ties with the U.S. as a solution [00:09:10].

## Australia's Position and Nuclear Ambitions

In 2022, a Lowy Institute poll indicated that approximately 36% of Australians supported or strongly supported the acquisition of nuclear weapons, a finding that surprised some observers [00:00:06].

### Impact of [[implications_of_the_aukus_agreement_on_nuclear_power | AUKUS]] on Public Perception
The announcement of [[implications_of_the_aukus_agreement_on_nuclear_power | AUKUS]] in August 2021, which involves Australia acquiring nuclear-powered submarines, notably did not trigger widespread public opposition to [[australia_and_nuclear_power | nuclear power]] as seen in the 1980s [00:00:29]. This suggests a greater public acceptance of [[australia_and_nuclear_power | nuclear power]] in Australia [00:01:32], potentially paving the way for discussions on civilian nuclear power [00:01:41].

### Preconditions for Australian Nuclear Acquisition
For Australia to consider acquiring its own nuclear weapons, several preconditions would likely need to be met:
*   **Regional Proliferation:** Japan and potentially South Korea would need to acquire nuclear weapons first [00:03:30]. Australia is geographically more distant from potential adversaries like China, making its security dilemma less acute than that of Japan, South Korea, or Taiwan [00:03:16].
*   **Taiwan's unique challenge:** Taiwan is unlikely to develop nuclear weapons due to its open society and deep penetration by Chinese intelligence services, which would make a secret program impossible and immediately trigger an invasion if discovered [00:03:41].
*   **Indonesian Acquiescence:** Indonesia's approval or cooperation would be crucial. Without it, any problem solved by Australia going nuclear would be undercut by the significant problems created with Indonesia, potentially turning Indonesia into an adversary [00:04:40].

### Deep-Rooted Alliance
The US-Australia alliance is deeply embedded within Australian bureaucracies and political culture [00:09:56]. The Five Eyes arrangement and close defense relationships exemplify this [00:10:03]. Both major political parties in Australia claim the alliance as their legacy, indicating its profound institutional and cultural significance [00:10:38]. This deep embedding makes fundamental reassessments of the alliance relationship challenging for Australian governments [00:11:45].

## Nuclear Blackmail vs. Nuclear Use

While direct nuclear use (detonating a device) against Australia is considered implausible due to the strong taboo against it [00:13:02], the threat of [[nuclear_blackmail_and_its_impact_on_international_relations | nuclear blackmail]] presents a different challenge [00:14:48].

[[nuclear_blackmail_and_its_impact_on_international_relations | Nuclear blackmail]] involves threatening nuclear use to coerce a country into acquiescing to demands or refraining from conventional warfare [00:14:50]. This was seen with Russia's threats to NATO and Ukraine [00:14:21] and historically when the U.S. deterred China from invading Taiwan in the 1950s [00:14:35].

The argument is that [[nuclear_blackmail_and_its_impact_on_international_relations | nuclear blackmail]] only works if the target believes the threat [00:15:29]. However, even a small probability of nuclear use, given its catastrophic consequences, could still affect decision-making [00:15:56]. Relying on the "nuclear taboo" to deter [[nuclear_blackmail_and_its_impact_on_international_relations | nuclear blackmail]] is a risk, but the alternative of Australia acquiring nuclear weapons also carries significant costs [00:16:03]. It becomes a matter of weighing these different costs and risks [00:16:18].

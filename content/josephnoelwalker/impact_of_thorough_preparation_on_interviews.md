Thorough preparation plays a crucial role in conducting successful interviews, particularly in knowledge-intensive fields. This includes not only understanding the subject matter but also refining the interviewing process itself.

## Defining Thorough Preparation

The preparation process can be "extremely unusual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, akin to being an "athlete of learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. For one interview, the total preparation can amount to approximately 200 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

This intense preparation includes:
*   **Non-intensive prep** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>: This might involve two months of work with a private tutor, studying textbooks on subjects like probability and statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. It can also include courses, such as a 50-hour course spread over two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Years of reading the guest's work can also be considered part of this long-term preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Intensive prep** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>: This typically occurs one to three weeks before the interview, involving 8 to 14 hours a day of reading relevant material, note-taking, and spaced repetition memory prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

The motivation for this rigorous learning is to achieve "great Excellence" in a "extremely concrete thing" â€“ the interview itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Benefits of Thorough Preparation

### Enhancing Interviewer Competence
Preparation allows the interviewer to "furnish myself with context" for the guest's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> and understand the subject matter deeply enough to "engage" with the guest effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This contrasts with simply "checking all the boxes" of a subject for its own sake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Eliciting Better Answers and Respect
A well-prepared interviewer avoids asking "silly or a waste of time" questions, which can cause the guest to lose respect and negatively impact the rest of the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. Instead, asking "penetrating questions that they haven't been asked before" encourages the guest to "lean forward" and "give you better answers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. This includes potentially sharing "things that are truly valuable to elicit" that haven't been shared publicly before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. The interviewer must "morally deserve those answers by putting in the work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

### Improved Audience Experience
Preparation enables the interviewer to act as a "translator" for the audience, supplying extra information when needed and interpreting the guest's ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. It also allows for spontaneous, insightful follow-ups that demonstrate a deeper understanding of the domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>.

### Personal Learning and Compounding Knowledge
The preparation process itself is a valuable learning experience. Memory prompts, for example, ensure that knowledge is "compounding" and that information retained from interviews years ago can be leveraged for future discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. This makes the study "more rewarding" and helps the interviewer grow in a "durable way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>. This consistent retention also makes subsequent days of intensive study easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>.

### Shortened Feedback Cycles
The practice of reviewing memory prompts daily provides a "shorter feedback cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>, which is "incredibly rewarding" and [[Continuous improvement in decision making | motivating]] for what can be a "tedious, lonely, difficult process" of solo research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. It helps confirm that progress is being made and that understanding is being built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.

## Techniques and Tools for Preparation

### Seeking Expert Advice
To gain a foundational understanding of a field, one consults experts to advise on a syllabus, asking for recommended textbooks, important chapters, and topics to focus on given time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Tutoring and Collaborative Learning
Working with a private tutor helps in mastering subjects like probability and statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Sessions can involve solving practice problems together on a whiteboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This interaction is invaluable for identifying and resolving gaps in foundational knowledge, a process known as "prerequisite chaining" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Just-in-Time Learning
When encountering unfamiliar concepts during reading, immediate clarification is sought through Googling, using large language models (LLMs) for definitions, or messaging friends who can provide quick explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. The rule is to first look it up yourself before bothering others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

### Strategic Reading and Note-Taking
*   **Prioritization**: The reading list is constantly evolving, prioritizing topics based on their importance, difficulty, and potential for creating "contrast value" by focusing on areas the guest hasn't discussed much before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
*   **Identifying Preconceptions**: Actively seeking out ways in which initial questions or understandings might be "obviously wrong" helps avoid asking "silly" questions in the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.
*   **Physical vs. Digital**: Reading is typically done physically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>, but with a digital version of the book open simultaneously for quick lookups and LLM interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   **Active Reading**: Monitoring understanding is crucial, and if a concept is important and unclear, it's looked up immediately to avoid impacting subsequent material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.
*   **Book Tags**: Using book tags (Post-it notes) to mark sections for memory prompts or important excerpts allows for uninterrupted reading flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>.
*   **Note-Taking**: Handwritten notes are taken during tutoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Digital notes, often in Obsidian, are used to capture excerpts, personal commentary, and questions for further investigation or the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

### Memory Prompts and Spaced Repetition
Memory prompts are created at the end of each chapter, derived from marked sections, to consolidate understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. The goal is to write prompts with [[empathy and satisfaction in scientific research | empathy]] for the future self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>, ensuring they are not too easy, too ambiguous, or easily confused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>. A key rule is to "understand before you memorize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>, although some definitional prompts may be created even with incomplete understanding to facilitate future learning of the language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.

### Organizing Interview Questions with a KanBan Board
An Obsidian KanBan plugin is used to organize interview questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>. Questions are initially dumped into a "to categorize" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a> and then organized into thematic columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>. This allows for easy prioritization and rearrangement of questions, crucial for structuring the "narrative Arc" and ensuring the audience can follow along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. Final questions are then formatted and printed for the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Physical KanBan boards can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>.

## Self-Reflection and Continuous Improvement

Even with extensive preparation, a deep sense of "guilt and shame" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:02">[01:21:02]</a> can arise if one feels inadequate, as happened with an interview conducted while working full-time and managing other commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49">[01:16:49]</a>. One strategy to manage insufficient prep is to pivot to focus on the guest's personal story, especially if they haven't shared it extensively before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>.

A critical rule is "if you don't understand the question, don't ask it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>. Asking a question without understanding it can lead to "disdain" from the guest and break the "real conversation," preventing follow-ups and deeper engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:39">[01:22:39]</a>.

The process of learning for interviews also involves [[Personal resilience and adaptation | learning about the art of interviewing]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:28">[01:10:28]</a>, with dedicated memory prompts for [[tips on systematic interview preparation | interview technique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. Examples include improving upon silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a> or transforming a question by "flipping the sign" (e.g., asking "what wouldn't you do?" instead of "what would you do?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>.

There's a constant challenge of balancing fixed time with flexible scope, meaning some material will inevitably "fall off the list" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:30">[01:31:30]</a>. Much of the preparation might not be "ultimately useful" in the interview, but it helps avoid "dumb questions" and serves as a valuable learning experience in itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:35">[01:28:35]</a>.

The goal is to increase efficiency and compounding knowledge between interviews to allow for more interviews and greater impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>. While a broad approach makes knowledge compounding slower, it is still intended to occur over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>.

## Sharing the Preparation Process

There is an aspiration to publish elements of the preparation process to highlight its value, as much of it is not visible in the final interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:09">[01:29:09]</a>. This includes:
*   Publishing Mochi decks (memory prompts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:46">[01:34:46]</a>.
*   Publishing Obsidian notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a>.
*   Sharing video recordings of the preparation process to offer a "fly-on-the-wall" perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:26">[01:34:26]</a>.
*   Publishing calls with private tutors, being mindful of potential changes in incentives when recording such conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>.

This openness aims to demystify the "invisible" nature of knowledge work and studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:03">[01:37:03]</a>, showing that thorough preparation is a learnable process, not just a result of inherent talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:15">[01:37:15]</a>.

## The Lowy Institute Poll

A 2022 poll conducted by the Lowy Institute revealed that approximately 36% of Australians either support or strongly support the [[australian_public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons_acquisition | US acquiring nuclear weapons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This specific finding is part of the broader [[nuclear_weapons_poll_in_australia | nuclear weapons poll in Australia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Unexpected Findings and Public Reaction

The poll's results were surprising to some, especially given the history of anti-nuclear campaigns in Australia during the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite the announcement of AUKUS, the expected surge in anti-nuclear activism did not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. There was also no significant [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons | popular reaction to the idea of Australia acquiring nuclear reactors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This lack of reaction led to the perception that [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons | Australians are more relaxed about nuclear power]] than previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Limitations of Poll Questions

One factor influencing the interpretation of poll results is the way questions are structured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Absence of Counterfactuals

Poll questions are generally presented without counterfactuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For example, when Australians are asked, "Do you want [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons | nuclear weapons]]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, they are not typically asked about the potential costs or trade-offs involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Instead, the question is simply, "Do you like [[public_opinion_on_nuclear_weapons | nuclear weapons]]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This direct approach, without exploring implications, can influence the reported public opinion.

The selection and maintenance of an inflation target, such as the widely adopted 2%, present significant challenges, particularly when considering adjustments to this target. While the specific number might seem arbitrary, its consistent achievement is crucial for economic stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## The Genesis of the 2% Target

The 2% inflation target, much like the initial 8% Basel Capital requirements, was chosen as a seemingly "reasonable thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. At this level, inflation is noticeable but generally does not cause concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Studies suggest that inflation typically becomes a problem when it reaches double digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, leaving substantial room between 2% and problematic levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

The primary concern with higher inflation is its potential to "start getting a life of its own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. Therefore, the goal is to maintain a level of inflation low enough that it goes largely unnoticed by the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. This stability helps [[price_stability_and_inflation_anchoring | anchor expectations]] around that target, ensuring that price movements are primarily relative rather than absolute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. At higher levels, relative price changes can become more absolute, leading to more generalized inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Dilemmas in Adjusting the Target

While the specific number for an inflation target might be somewhat arbitrary, the consistency with which [[central_banks_and_2_inflation_target | central banks]] hit it is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Attempts to change the target, for example, from 2% to 4%, face significant challenges:

*   **Admitting Defeat**: If inflation is significantly above 2%, proposing a higher target like 4% can be perceived as an admission of defeat, suggesting the central bank is unable to bring inflation back to the original goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
*   **Perceived Ridiculousness**: If inflation is at or below 2% and the central bank proposes a higher target, it can appear illogical. This was exemplified before the COVID-19 pandemic when the [[central_banks_and_2_inflation_target | Fed]] faced persistently low inflation, around 1.2% over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Suggestions to raise the target to 4% seemed "ridiculous" because the central bank couldn't even achieve 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

Instead of changing the numerical target, the [[central_banks_and_2_inflation_target | Fed]] opted to alter its policy framework to be more accommodating of inflation, aiming to bring it up to the 2% goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the specific number chosen for an inflation target is less important than ensuring it remains "below the radar screen of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a> and is consistently met. The difficulty of changing an established target underscores the importance of the initial choice and the commitment to its maintenance.

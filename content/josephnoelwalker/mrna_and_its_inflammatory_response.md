The initial objective of research was to develop therapeutic protein-coding RNA without creating inflammatory molecules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This led to an investigation into why synthesized RNA might elicit an inflammatory response compared to RNA found naturally within cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Understanding Immune Response to External RNA

The hypothesis was that external RNA, when introduced to immune cells, causes inflammation because RNA is not typically found outside the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. To test this, researchers planned to isolate RNA from human cells and compare its effect on immune cells to that of in vitro-synthesized RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Initially, it was expected that all types of RNA would activate an immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Key Discovery: Non-Immunogenic RNA

Contrary to expectations, isolated [[transfer_rna_and_immune_response | Transfer RNA]] (tRNA) did not induce an immune response when introduced to immune cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This finding led to a new hypothesis: the extensive [[nucleoside_modifications_and_nonimmunogenic_rna | nucleoside modifications]] found in tRNA might be responsible for its non-immunogenic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

The challenge then became how to prove this hypothesis and synthesize RNA containing these specific nucleoside modifications to test their effect on immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Original Research Motivation

The initial goal was not to create non-immunogenic RNA, as the researchers were unaware such a possibility existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Instead, the primary question was whether [[differences_between_synthetic_and_cellderived_rna | synthetically produced RNA differed from cellular RNA]] in terms of immune activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The method to ascertain this involved isolating RNA from cells, synthesizing RNA in vitro, and then observing how immune cells responded to both types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

Most tested RNA did induce an immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. While RNA is naturally inside the body's cells, injury can cause it to be released, leading to an inflammatory reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Early in a talent scout's work picking [[talent_scouting_in_india | India winners]], a question was posed regarding the level of risk being taken in selections. The scout was asked if they were taking "enough risk" and where the "failure rate" was, despite their selections all succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

This specific inquiry prompted a careful reflection on the selection process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Such a question, focusing on potential under-risking despite success, is noted as unique, as typically, success leads to leaving processes undisturbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## [[rejection_analysis_in_talent_scouting | Rejection Analysis]]

To address the question of risk, the scout undertook an analysis of all candidates who were *not* given grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The goal was to determine if rejections were due to projects being too risky or "out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Findings from the Analysis

The assessment revealed that none of the rejections were primarily due to the inherent riskiness of the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Instead, rejections stemmed from other issues:
*   The person not having a sufficiently fleshed-out idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   The project not being risky *enough*, often described as "too cookie cutter" or "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This suggested a lack of novel contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

This analysis confirmed that the current level of risk-taking was appropriate based on the identified reasons for rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Continuous Assessment of Risk

> [!NOTE] Recommendation for Talent Scouts
> It is beneficial for new talent scouts to regularly perform this exercise of reviewing rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This practice involves periodically revisiting past rejections to assess whether the initial decision was appropriate and to understand the underlying reasons for those decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It helps in evaluating the consistency and rationale of selection criteria over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This contributes to better [[evaluating_success_and_failure_rates | evaluation of success and failure rates]].

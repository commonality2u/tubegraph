Research into therapeutic protein-coding RNA initially aimed to create molecules without inflammatory properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. A key challenge identified was the inflammatory response triggered when RNA, introduced from outside, encountered immune cells, as RNA is not naturally supposed to be extracellular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This challenge is central to [[understanding_immune_response_to_rna | understanding immune response to RNA]].

## Investigating Immunogenicity

To understand why externally introduced RNA was inflammatory, researchers hypothesized that synthetic RNA might differ in its immune interaction compared to RNA found within human cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The initial expectation was that all types of RNA would activate and generate an immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

An experimental approach was devised:
1.  Isolate RNA from human cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
2.  Produce RNA *in vitro* (in a tube) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
3.  Expose these RNA types to specialized human immune cells (dendritic cells) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
4.  Observe and compare their immune responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Discovery of Non-Immunogenic RNA

During these experiments, various types of RNA were tested, including transfer RNA (tRNA), ribosomal RNA, and different bacterial RNAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Surprisingly, it was found that transfer RNA (tRNA) did not induce any immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

This unexpected finding led to the hypothesis that the reason for tRNA's non-immunogenicity might be its characteristic feature of containing the most modified nucleosides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This discovery highlighted the critical role of [[nucleoside_modification_in_rna | nucleoside modification in RNA]] in modulating immune responses.

## Broader Implications

The initial research goal was not to create non-immunogenic RNA, but rather to understand if synthetically produced RNA differed from naturally occurring cellular RNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. While most RNA types tested *did* induce an immune response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, the identification of non-immunogenic tRNA opened new avenues for developing therapeutic protein-coding RNA that could avoid undesirable inflammatory reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This principle became fundamental to the [[development_of_mrna_vaccines | Development of mRNA vaccines]].

It is also recognized that even RNA originating from within the body can cause an inflammatory reaction if it is released outside the cell due to injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

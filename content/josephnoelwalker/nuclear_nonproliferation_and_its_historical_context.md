The relative success of [[nuclear_proliferation_and_its_implications | nuclear nonproliferation]] since the 1960s has often been a topic of inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Historian Richard Rhodes, author of *The Making of the Atomic Bomb*, noted in 2023 that despite dark predictions in the 1960s—including from figures like John F. Kennedy—that there would be "a couple of dozen nuclear States" within a generation, there are currently only nine nuclear states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This represents a containment of "the breakout from the five nuclear weapons States in 1968 to just four more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)

The origins of successful [[nuclear_proliferation_and_its_implications | nuclear nonproliferation]] are partly attributed to the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the world "so close to blowing up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Correspondence between Kennedy and Khrushchev after the crisis quickly led to the decision that "some kind of treaty had to be set up to prevent that proliferation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This resulted in the [[the_role_of_the_nuclear_nonproliferation_treaty_in_global_arms_control | Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty]] (NPT), tabled in 1968 and taking effect in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The NPT was based on a "fundamental bargain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>:
*   Non-nuclear powers would not acquire nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   In return, they would receive support from major powers for "Peaceful uses of nuclear energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   Nuclear powers would work towards "Universal nuclear disarmament" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

The promise of universal nuclear disarmament has "not been kept" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, leading to restlessness among non-nuclear signatories, who nearly abrogated the treaty in 1995 when it came up for renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Unlike most treaties written in perpetuity, the NPT was given a 25-year lifespan, after which it would be reviewed and either renewed permanently or set aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 was a "pivotal moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, as any further votes would have required new ratification by a majority of member states, which was considered "impossible" by the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

The NPT defines nuclear weapon states as those that "built and tested a nuclear explosive device before the 1st of January 1967" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. These are the US, the Soviet Union (now Russia), the UK, France, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Other countries with nuclear weapons, such as India, Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan, are not signatories to the NPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. Countries that have signed and ratified the treaty have conformed to it, not acquiring weapons themselves or assisting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.

## Australia's Historical Stance on Nuclear Weapons

Surprisingly, despite its "storied efforts in service of the cause of the elimination of nuclear weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, Australia initially refused to sign the NPT for two years under the Gorton government, from 1968 to 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Australia was the second-last country to sign before the treaty came into force in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

This hesitation was "primarily to keep the option open of developing its own nuclear Arsenal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The Australian Atomic Energy Commission was largely under the control of Sir Philip Baxter, a scientist who had worked on the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Baxter advocated for Australia to develop its own nuclear weapons, proposing a reactor in Jervis Bay to produce "weapons grade fissile material" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. His outlook was that "white folk have a right to... develop the weapons that we need to keep the hordes away from harming us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

There was "a very severe argument" within the Australian government and bureaucracy about acquiring nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Dean Rusk, then US Secretary of State, noted Gorton's deep concern about giving up the nuclear option for 25 years, and his belief that Australia "could not rely upon the United States for nuclear weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Richard Butler, then in the Department of Foreign Affairs, expressed his deep upset at Gorton's initial decision not to sign, comparing Sir Philip Baxter to Dr. Strangelove in an article for The Bulletin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Australia eventually joined the NPT, but "entered reservations" allowing for potential withdrawal in "extremist" circumstances, a "sop for the right-wing of the Liberal Party" and Philip Baxter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The possibility of Australia starting a nuclear weapons program was "by no means small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, with Baxter's influence being "very very strong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Other countries, like Sweden and South Africa, also had significant nuclear weapons programs before joining the NPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. South Africa even conducted tests, with a "weird event" in the South Atlantic in 1979 consistent with a test, possibly conducted on behalf of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>. Argentina and Brazil also embarked on nuclear weapons programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.

## Richard Butler's Diplomatic Career

[[richard_butlers_diplomatic_career_and_contributions_to_nuclear_diplomacy | Richard Butler's diplomatic career and contributions to nuclear diplomacy]] are extensive. He played a crucial role in the renewal and extension of the NPT and engineered the passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Indefinite Extension of the NPT (1995)

At the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference in New York, the challenge was that non-nuclear weapon states felt the nuclear powers had not upheld their bargain to disarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Egypt, for example, was "absolutely resolute that there'll be no extension to this treaty unless that bargain shows real progress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

Butler devised a solution: proposing a separate, supplementary set of "politically binding" documents that prescribed "better behavior on the part of the nuclear weapon States" regarding disarmament and elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. This included a fissile materials cut-off treaty, a recommitment to the NPT's Article 6, and a crucial commitment to a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. These documents were adopted alongside the NPT extension vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

The agreement was hammered out at a dinner hosted by Butler at his residence in New York, attended by representatives from key groups including non-aligned countries and permanent members of the Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. The meeting, which lasted from "after 9:00 p.m." until "about 2 a.m." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>, involved "eating and talking and drinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. The solution was adopted the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>, leading to the indefinite extension of the NPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

### Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)

Banning nuclear testing is critical for [[nuclear_proliferation_and_its_implications | nonproliferation]] because new nuclear weapons require testing to confirm they work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. The CTBT negotiations in Geneva were ultimately blocked by India, which withheld its consensus, as the Conference on Disarmament operated by a rule of consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.

Butler bypassed this problem by submitting the CTBT text as a draft resolution to the UN General Assembly in Australia's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>. He attached the identical text that had been considered in Geneva, allowing the General Assembly, with its different rules of procedure, to act on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>. India reacted furiously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.

Butler then campaigned tirelessly, meeting with groups of permanent representatives from every member state to garner support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>. The resolution was "overwhelmingly adopted" by the General Assembly, and the CTBT was opened for signature about a month later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. US President Bill Clinton personally thanked Butler for getting the treaty on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. This treaty aimed "to stop all nuclear tests by explosion in all environments for all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.

### Ambassador for Disarmament

In 1983, Richard Butler was appointed Australia's first Ambassador for Disarmament, a role unique at the time, with only one other such ambassador in the world (Mexico's Alfonso García Robles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>. This appointment, made by Foreign Minister Bill Hayden, aimed to lead Australian disarmament negotiations globally across chemical, biological, and nuclear subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>. Australia's decision "sent a quite a ripple through the International Community" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>, and other countries soon followed suit, appointing their own disarmament ambassadors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>.

The number of nuclear weapons in the world reached 60,000 before reductions brought it down to "closer to 10 or 11,000" due to a series of arms control treaties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>.

## The Art of Diplomacy

Butler identifies listening as the "most non-obvious skill or quality that the very best diplomats possess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>. Diplomats must listen carefully to discern true intentions, even when masked by agreeable language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>.

A typical day for a diplomat involves reading overnight messages, emails, and news, then deciding on necessary actions like sending messages, seeking instructions, or arranging meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>. The work environment can range from UN headquarters to foreign ministries or company offices, sometimes even dealing with Australians in jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:55">[01:30:55]</a>. Social engagements like lunches, cocktails, and national day receptions are a "burden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:32">[01:31:32]</a>, often managed with brief appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:39">[01:32:39]</a>.

Australia has a history of being "true believers" in multilateral diplomacy within the UN context, dating back to Doc Evatt at San Francisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>. The country is perceived as a good international citizen with credibility, and as a middle power, it thrives in multilateral settings where it is not dominated by greater powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:15">[01:20:15]</a>. Australia's discomfort with exercising raw power in bilateral settings also makes multilateralism a more comfortable arena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:37">[01:20:37]</a>. The presence of talented diplomats like Butler and John Gee (who made an "enormous impact" in chemical weapons diplomacy) contributes to this success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>. However, Butler notes a recent decline in Australia's independent foreign policy due to its "self-wrought relationship with the United States," which has led some countries to view Australia as "a Lackey or colony of the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:55">[01:22:55]</a>.

## Verification and Inspections

The CTBT spawned an impressive International Monitoring System, primarily a "seismological system" that registers tremors to detect underground explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:20">[01:36:20]</a>. This data is collected and analyzed in Vienna, with notices sent to participating states on detected events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:34">[01:37:34]</a>.

From 1997 to 1999, Butler chaired UNSCOM, the body set up by the UN Security Council to inspect Iraq for weapons of mass destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. At its height, UNSCOM had "a thousand inspectors in the field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:58">[01:49:58]</a>, verifying the non-existence of such weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:27">[01:50:27]</a>. Nuclear weapons leave large, easily detectable footprints, with "clear throughput figures" of materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:03">[01:52:03]</a>. Biological and chemical weapons are harder to verify due to "dual use" substances, but inspections still look for indicators, markers, and residues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:02">[01:53:02]</a>.

## Nuclear Disarmament and Deterrence in the 21st Century

The [[the_future_of_nuclear_disarmament_and_global_security_concerns | future of nuclear disarmament and global security concerns]] remains uncertain. The Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, established by Prime Minister Paul Keating in 1996, produced a report widely recognized as a "fundamentally sound approach" to eliminating nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:35">[02:08:35]</a>.

The core syllogism of the Canberra Commission is:
1.  "As long as nuclear weapons exist they will one day be used by accident or design" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:13">[02:10:13]</a>.
2.  "Any use would be absolutely devastating to the whole world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:21">[02:10:21]</a>.
3.  "The only safe thing to do with nuclear weapons is to see them onto a museum shelf, is to eliminate them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:28">[02:10:28]</a>.

The means to achieve this are well known, including test ban treaties and cut-off treaties for fissile material production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:36">[02:10:36]</a>. Despite the recent "deeply disturbing" language regarding nuclear weapons use, there is global awareness of these axioms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:57">[02:09:57]</a>.

Butler believes the concept of "minimal deterrence" is "BS," as "there is no such thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>; once the nuclear line is crossed, other nuclear states will likely escalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:21">[02:11:21]</a>. He argues that [[implications_of_nuclear_blackmail_and_deterrence_by_countries_like_china | nuclear deterrence]] is "illusory" and "unless you're prepared to really commit massive homicide... there's no point in acquiring a weapon that would simply encourage that person that you have anxiety about to do the same or more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:48">[02:21:48]</a>.

Regarding [[challenges_related_to_extended_nuclear_deterrence_and_us_alliances | extended nuclear deterrence and US alliances]], Butler does not believe Australia can or should rely on a nuclear weapon state to protect it, as such a decision would simply attract retaliation to that state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. He holds that Australia is currently "living in cuckoo land" about the extent to which the US would protect it in a nuclear conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:43">[01:24:43]</a>. He strongly opposes the AUKUS agreement, calling it "the worst foreign policy and National Security decision our country has ever taken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:36">[01:46:36]</a>. He warns that the presence and expansion of US bases in Australia, including airfields used by nuclear-capable B-52 bombers, make it harder for Australia to maintain an independent foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:36">[01:48:36]</a> and are "contrary to our obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation" treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:02">[01:48:02]</a>.

On the prospect of more nuclear weapon states, Butler states he "can't answer that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:48">[02:16:48]</a>, noting it depends on governments moving towards "right-wing extremism" and deciding to disregard international norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:01">[02:17:01]</a>. He worries about countries with a "big sense of their national pride" acquiring these "adult toy[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:38">[02:20:38]</a>. If Australia felt it could no longer rely on US extended deterrence and regional countries like Indonesia acquired nuclear forces, Butler believes it would not be "justifiable" for Australia to consider building its own nuclear force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:26">[02:21:26]</a>. While Australia has ample uranium (one-third of the world's supply) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:44">[02:22:44]</a>, acquiring nuclear weapons would take "years rather than months" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:33">[02:23:33]</a>.

There appears to be a general complacency about [[nuclear_proliferation_and_its_implications | proliferation]] today, potentially because major nuclear powers are "pretty smug about their own continuing uniqueness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:29">[02:24:29]</a>, or because other pressing global issues like climate change and food supply overshadow concerns about nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:40">[02:24:40]</a>.

For young people interested in careers reducing the risk of nuclear war, Butler advises pursuing education in nuclear science and technology, international politics, and international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:37">[02:26:37]</a>. Learning a relevant foreign language is also crucial for working in international affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:32">[02:28:32]</a>. Above all, he emphasizes the importance of listening intently during negotiations, as people "will tell you unwittingly what they're really about" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:03">[02:29:03]</a>.

## Lack of Widespread National Mission and Public Engagement

Since China's emergence as a great power in the early post-Cold War years, no American president has declared the [[americas_national_mission_regarding_chinas_rise | China challenge]] to be a national mission requiring a "whole of nation" effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This contrasts with the magnitude of the challenge; China's [[us_china_economic_and_military_power_dynamics | economic]] scale surpasses 60% of American GDP, making it a larger challenge than the [[comparison_of_chinas_challenge_to_historical_threats_like_cold_war_and_world_war_ii | Cold War]] in most respects and already a bigger economic challenge than [[comparison_of_chinas_challenge_to_historical_threats_like_cold_war_and_world_war_ii | Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Such a comprehensive national response cannot be a quiet, "Beltway" project; it demands public commitment from the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Absence of Intellectual and Popular Cultural Engagement

The current [[lack_of_intellectual_and_popular_cultural_engagement_with_chinas_challenge | intellectual environment]] in the U.S. does not suggest that the [[assessment_of_americas_preparedness_for_a_contest_with_china | United States is primed for a contest]] of this nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. There is a noticeable lack of engagement in the [[lack_of_intellectual_and_popular_cultural_engagement_with_chinas_challenge | popular culture]]; for example, commentators like Joe Rogan are not "obsessed" with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Similarly, the necessary [[lack_of_intellectual_and_popular_cultural_engagement_with_chinas_challenge | intellectual heft]] is largely confined to the foreign policy establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. While American scholars, think tankers, political advisers, and military analysts produce numerous books and articles in specialized journals like *Foreign Affairs* discussing the "China Challenge" or "China Threat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, this engagement does not extend widely beyond this "Beltway crowd." Prominent columnists like David Brooks and Ross Douthat, for instance, are not writing books about the China challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Contrast with Historical Challenges (Cold War, War on Terror)

The current level of engagement contrasts sharply with past national challenges:

*   **Cold War**: The [[comparison_of_chinas_challenge_to_historical_threats_like_cold_war_and_world_war_ii | Cold War]] saw the development of "Cold War liberalism" as an entire school of thought, indicating a broad intellectual and cultural commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **War on Terrorism**: The War on Terror spurred widespread intellectual and media obsession, with figures like Andrew Sullivan, Christopher Hitchens, Paul Berman, Michael Ignatieff, and *The New York Times* editorial page deeply engaged with questions of maintaining liberal democracy in the face of radical Islamist threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

At present, no comparable intellectual ferment exists in the United States to support the scale of the challenge that the American governing class claims to be undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

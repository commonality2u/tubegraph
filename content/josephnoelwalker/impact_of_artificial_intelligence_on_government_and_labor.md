Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are expected to become increasingly powerful, with large language models potentially evolving into agents capable of complex tasks over weeks or months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This progress raises significant questions about the future of government and labor.

## Historical Perspective on Technological Advancements in Government

Technological shifts have dramatically reshaped government operations in the past, offering a lens through which to consider the [[Impact of AI on economic growth|current challenges and opportunities in AI technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

### The Decline of Typist Pools
When Ken Henry joined the Treasury in 1984, government departments widely used "typist pools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. These consisted of individuals who spent their entire workdays typing documents and making duplicates for filing purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. This labor-intensive process was common even in university settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

### The Spreadsheet Revolution
The introduction of electronic spreadsheets, such as Lotus 1-2-3 and later Microsoft Excel, marked a significant leap in efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Prior to this, academics and government staff used punch cards to feed data into computers with far less processing power than a modern mobile phone, leading to long waits for results and delayed error correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. For example, developing computable general equilibrium models using punch cards could take a month due to the slow feedback loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. In contrast, the same model could be built from scratch in two hours using Lotus 1-2-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

The Australian Treasury was reportedly among the first users of Microsoft Excel in Canberra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. This software proved instrumental, notably in developing a modeling capability to assess indirect tax changes and their distributional impacts within a six-month deadline, which was crucial for the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. Without this technological capability, the consumption tax would likely not have been introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.

### The Arrival of the Internet
The internet's introduction to government departments was initially met with security concerns, restricting access for many staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. Despite potential misuse, the internet is considered one of humanity's greatest inventions due to its ability to provide information rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

## [[Geopolitical and governance implications of AI|AI's Impact on Government Structure and Policy Making]]

The increasing power of AI systems is expected to significantly alter the dynamic between ministers and their departments.

### Shifting Dynamics in Policy Advice
Ministers, facing high-pressure environments, often prefer to receive information in oral or graphic forms rather than wading through extensive text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. They value quick understanding and a presentation format that helps them communicate the story to a wider audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>.

The rise of AI capable of producing impeccably researched briefs in hours or days could lead to increased pressure on public servants to deliver advice more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>. While AI can provide information, ministers still value human accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a> and the ability to interact with someone they can "tell off" or explain political realities to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:20:00">[24:20:00]</a>. They also want unvarnished advice, not advice tailored to what the AI *thinks* is in their head, as they desire to maintain privacy regarding their personal ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51:00">[24:51:00]</a>.

### The Future of Governance with [[Artificial General Intelligence and its feasibility|AGI]]
The emergence of [[Artificial General Intelligence and its feasibility|Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)]] raises fundamental questions about the need for human leadership in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>. Some theories suggest there might be no need for a judiciary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a> or even politicians in a future where AI can solve most cognitive tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>.

However, the importance of human checks and balances, and the separation of powers, is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a>. Humans in executive roles would be primarily responsible for matters of morality and ethics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:19:00">[21:19:00]</a>, aspects that AI, while capable of mimicking, cannot be inherently trusted with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>. A key challenge for systems of governance is determining how much license to give to super-smart agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>.

One concern is that increased knowledge provided by AI might make politicians even more cautious, potentially hindering courageous policy-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>. The real limitation to policy development is often not a lack of cognitive ability, but rather political strategy, such as the "small target strategy" where parties offer minimal policy proposals to avoid alienating voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a>.

## [[Impact of AI on economic growth|AI and the Future of Labor]]

Historically, technological advancements, including the Industrial Revolution, have generally made humans more productive without displacing them from the production process, leading to sustained growth in real wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:00">[32:26:00]</a>. This has been largely due to capital deepening and technology augmenting labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:39:00">[32:39:00]</a>.

### Automation and Job Displacement
In the Australian Public Service (APS), the percentage of staff in the lowest two bands (APS 1 and 2) decreased from about 50% in the 1980s to about 5% today, largely due to automation of tasks like typing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>.

However, the advent of human-level AI or [[Artificial General Intelligence and its feasibility|AGI]] poses a profound challenge: it targets higher-level inquiry and creative thinking, which were previously considered indispensable human contributions to the production function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:55:00">[31:55:00]</a>. There is a real possibility that the production process might no longer offer a secure form of income for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:37:00">[36:37:00]</a>, especially the 50% of Australian workers currently in knowledge-based roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:26:00">[34:26:00]</a>.

### Economic and Fiscal Implications
This potential shift could lead to a scenario where a shrinking pool of workers can afford the services produced by highly automated, AI-driven industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:20:00">[37:20:00]</a>. While Say's Law (production equals consumption) would still broadly hold, the distribution of income could become highly concentrated among owners of AI-producing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:38:00">[37:38:00]</a>.

This raises critical questions about:
*   **Income Redistribution**: The need for big redistributive taxes to support those displaced from traditional employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:21:00">[38:21:00]</a>.
*   **Taxation Challenges**: The difficulty in taxing income and consumption bases that are increasingly "extraterritorial" or outside the reach of national tax systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:29:00">[39:29:00]</a>.

Governments are beginning to consider new forms of taxation for this purpose, though the effectiveness and international cooperation required remain uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:06:00">[39:06:00]</a>.

The optimistic view is that humanity will find ways to make new technologies work for us, leading to continued productivity and real wage growth, similar to previous industrial and technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Public policy's task should be to ensure AI becomes a labor assistant, improving productivity rather than displacing labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:52">[01:58:52]</a>.

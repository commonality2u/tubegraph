Australia's response to the COVID-19 pandemic saw both significant success, particularly in economic intervention, and notable failures, including its [[australias_response_to_the_covid19_pandemic | vaccine procurement strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:10">[03:07:10]</a>. While the nation's administrative state was generally high-functioning and outperformed countries like the United States in several key measures, the vaccine rollout was considered "the worst" globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:08">[03:29:08]</a>.

## Australia's Approach and Outcome
On January 25, 2020, the first COVID-19 case was reported in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. By March 30, 2020, then-Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced the largest economic intervention in Australian history, a third of a trillion dollars in stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. However, the same National Cabinet and Public Service that managed the economic response also oversaw a highly criticized [[australias_response_to_the_covid19_pandemic | vaccine procurement strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:10">[03:07:10]</a>.

Australia initially "went all in on two vaccines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:07">[03:42:07]</a>: the UQ vaccine and the AstraZeneca vaccine, rather than diversifying its portfolio by "placing insurance on up to say eight" as the United States did with Operation Warp Speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:07">[03:42:07]</a>. This proved problematic because the UQ vaccine failed, and AstraZeneca was found to be "less efficacious than some of the other vaccines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:44">[03:59:44]</a>. As a result, for a couple of months in 2021, Australia had the worst vaccination rate of any OECD nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:30">[04:15:30]</a>.

## Reasons for Failure
Several factors contributed to the perceived failure of Australia's [[australias_response_to_the_covid19_pandemic | vaccine procurement strategy]]:

### Health Department's Role
A significant factor identified was the Health Department's involvement. It is suggested that "anything that happens in and around the health department is a kind of disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:41">[05:20:41]</a>, and those familiar with its operations were "not completely unsurprised" by the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:77">[05:26:77]</a>.

### Treasury's Limited Influence
While Treasury officials were "in the room" during discussions and decisions, they were arguably "not at the table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:08">[06:12:08]</a>. It's believed that Treasury officials, who "do actually understand what insurance is about," would have had a different view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:02">[06:31:02]</a>. There was also pushback against economists' involvement, with questions like "what do economists have to add to a [[australias_response_to_the_covid19_pandemic | vaccine strategy]] discussion?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:22">[07:07:22]</a>, despite procurement being an economic question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:07">[07:27:07]</a>.

### Category Error in Advice
Ministers, including Greg Hunt and Scott Morrison, seemingly treated the Department of Health's advice as "medical advice" rather than "public health advice," which should be "subject to economic principles and economic thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:07">[08:14:07]</a>. This indicated a failure to synthesize advice from various domains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:30">[09:51:30]</a>. Health bureaucrats, for instance, don't necessarily consider a "social welfare framework" or "negative externalities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:65">[10:51:65]</a>.

### Lack of Viewpoint Diversity
The medical regulatory complex lacked "enough Viewpoint diversity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:75">[11:59:75]</a>, with a disproportionate number of medical professionals, immunologists, and biologists, but few others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:35">[12:08:35]</a>. Nick Coatsworth, former deputy chief medical officer, also made this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:23">[12:22:23]</a>.

### Failure to Heed the Tinbergen Rule
One analysis attributes the procurement failure to a failure to heed the Tinbergen rule, which states that "you want one policy instrument per goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:06">[13:01:06]</a>. Australia attempted to use [[australias_response_to_the_covid19_pandemic | vaccine procurement]] to double as industry policy, choosing the UQ and AstraZeneca vaccines because they could be manufactured locally by CSL in Melbourne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:04">[13:10:04]</a>.

### Failure to Buy Insurance/Optionality
A primary flaw was the failure to buy insurance by not diversifying the vaccine portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:40">[13:29:40]</a>. Had Australia procured a full portfolio of vaccines, it would have had the option to use them for its population or assist Pacific allies and neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:28:44">[29:28:44]</a>.

### "Penny-Pinching" Mindset
The Health Department, accustomed to "penny pinching" to control health spending, applied this mindset to the pandemic, failing to recognize that "the cost benefit analysis blows out by several orders of magnitude" in a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:04">[15:46:04]</a>. This meant they had difficulty "confronting the situation where you have to throw that whole framework out of the window" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:02">[16:28:02]</a>.

## Lessons for Future Crises
To improve future crisis management, several principles emerge from this experience:
*   **Be honest with people:** This includes acknowledging what is known and unknown, avoiding "noble lies" like the initial advice against masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:96">[26:20:96]</a>.
*   **Maintain flexibility and avoid fighting the last war:** Crisis responses should not simply pull a playbook from the shelf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:13">[27:52:13]</a>. Different crises require different approaches; for example, the 2008 financial crisis focused on getting money out the door, which was not entirely appropriate for the supply contraction of the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>.
*   **Maintain optionality:** Governments should keep options open and avoid decisions that "cut off option value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:15:02">[29:15:02]</a>.
*   **Be willing to spend money:** In major crises, the welfare loss from inaction is "massive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:24:26">[30:24:26]</a>. It's often "not a big deal" to spend money, as the costs of not doing so can be much larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:56:06">[31:56:06]</a>. This highlights the "don't be Pennywise pound foolish" principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:48:99">[31:48:99]</a>.

### Reforms for the Medical Regulatory Complex
For future pandemics, particularly if a pathogen has "much worse characteristics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:33:04">[37:33:04]</a>, reforms are needed in the medical regulatory complex. This might involve changes to the composition of bodies like ATAGI, allowing for broader perspectives beyond purely medical ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:49">[20:02:49]</a>. The ability to accelerate processes like Stage Three trials for vaccines would be critical if the [[development_of_mrna_vaccines | mRNA technology]] allowed for rapid vaccine creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:44">[18:23:44]</a>.

### Maintaining Public Consent
Beyond pharmaceutical interventions, the success of "nonpharmaceutical interventions" like quarantine and lockdowns relies on "people's good faith" and "voluntary behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:15">[20:49:15]</a>. The failures in the [[australias_response_to_the_covid19_pandemic | vaccine rollout]] "push[ed] people too hard" and risked "an unraveling" of public trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:33">[24:49:33]</a>. Maintaining this public consent is crucial for future crisis responses, as initial responses (like the first six weeks of the pandemic) were deemed "flawless" due to public willingness to comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:64">[22:20:64]</a>.

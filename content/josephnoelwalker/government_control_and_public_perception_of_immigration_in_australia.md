Australia's immigration policy is a critical element of its national identity and economic strategy, yet its mechanisms and public reception are often misunderstood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:46">[01:46:46]</a>. A significant shift in policy in 2001, largely unnoticed at the time, fundamentally altered Australia's immigration landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Evolution of Immigration Policy and Control

In 2001, the Howard government introduced regulatory changes that increased Australia's immigration intake to levels not seen since the post-war "populate and perish" era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This decision aimed to maintain the skill level of migrants despite a limited pool of applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. The innovative solution was a massive expansion of [[role_of_international_students_in_australias_immigration_system | international students]] and working holiday makers, with the idea that they would upskill and then be eligible for permanent residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. Over two decades, more than 2 million such individuals have come to Australia, many settling permanently, with [[role_of_international_students_in_australias_immigration_system | international students]] making up over 40% of annual net migration in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This makes decisions about [[role_of_international_students_in_australias_immigration_system | international students]] central to modern Australian immigration policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

### The Role of Temporary Visas in Net Migration

Australia's net overseas migration (NOM), defined as people staying or leaving for 12 out of 16 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:14">[01:17:14]</a>, includes both permanent and temporary programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:26">[01:27:26]</a>. While the government caps the permanent program, the temporary program (which includes [[role_of_international_students_in_australias_immigration_system | international students]] and working holiday makers) is demand-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:36">[01:35:36]</a>. This demand-driven nature means that the government's level of control over migration numbers is not immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:20">[01:52:20]</a>. Policy changes typically take one to five years to manifest their effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:20">[01:52:20]</a>.

For instance, the boom in net migration in recent years was largely due to policy decisions made during the COVID-19 pandemic and before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:53">[01:55:53]</a>. The Albanese government was criticized for not responding quickly enough, leading to levels they were not comfortable with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>.

### Technological Advancements for Border Control

Australia's unique geographical position as an island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a> and early investments in immigration control systems have historically provided advantages. Key decisions made decades prior to 2001, such as the introduction of a universal visa system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:34">[01:16:34]</a> and the electronic Travel Authority (ETA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a> in the early 1990s, were crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:54">[01:53:54]</a>. The ETA system integrated with airline reservation systems globally, allowing real-time tracking of people entering and leaving Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>. This level of control, while initially seen as "mad" by other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:42">[01:42:42]</a>, aimed to know "who's in the country and who's left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.

## Public Perception and the "Control" Narrative

Public confidence in immigration policy is heavily influenced by the perception of government control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:46">[01:42:46]</a>. When net migration appears to be "out of control," as it did recently, public attitudes against migration tend to rise, along with concerns about the capacity of infrastructure and service delivery to keep up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>.

### Immigration and the Housing Crisis

The public often links immigration to issues like the housing crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:39">[01:32:39]</a>. While [[role_of_international_students_in_australias_immigration_system | international students]] do impact demand for housing, particularly near universities and in CBDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:07">[01:33:07]</a>, their impact in suburban areas where many housing complaints originate is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:23">[01:33:23]</a>. Many other factors contribute to housing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:49">[01:33:49]</a>, but blaming immigrants remains a "go-to" for politicians and the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:58">[01:33:58]</a>.

### Challenges with Unauthorized Migrants

Australia faces a challenge with approximately 100,000 individuals who have exhausted their visa options and "shouldn't be in the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:23">[02:20:23]</a>. This situation largely stemmed from a labor trafficking scam that emerged around 2015-2016, leading to a surge in asylum applications from nationalities like Malaysia and China, who typically have low success rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:10">[02:21:10]</a>. The backlog only slowed when international borders closed during COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>.

Abul Rizvi, a former Deputy Secretary of the Department of Immigration, suggests that a mass deportation program would be astronomically expensive, disruptive, and ultimately fail, citing the US experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:12">[02:25:12]</a>. The biggest cost of deportation is the massive detention capacity required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:26">[02:28:26]</a>. Instead, he advocates for stopping the problem from growing by processing applications faster to prevent organizers from benefiting from work rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:55">[02:32:55]</a>, and finding a "subtle way to give them a pathway to permanent residence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:31">[02:37:31]</a>, acknowledging it might be perceived as an amnesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:41">[02:47:41]</a>. Such "amnesties" have happened before, like the "one November category" visa introduced by Paul Keating in 1993 for 40,000-50,000 Chinese students who were unlikely to return home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:30">[02:58:30]</a>.

### Public Opinion on Immigration

The political elite generally agrees on an equilibrium between strict enforcement against unauthorized immigration and a relatively open legal migration program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This is based on the idea that if the public perceives the government to be in control, they will accept high net migration numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:30">[02:44:30]</a>.

However, there's a risk this narrative could break down, as seen in the UK where high levels and cultural mix have led to growing intolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:42">[02:44:42]</a>. If Australians were to vote on the 2001 policy changes today, they might not support them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:01">[02:46:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

Australia's immigration system, particularly the [[impact_of_2001_immigration_policy_changes_in_australia | 2001 policy changes]] and the growth of [[role_of_international_students_in_australias_immigration_system | international students]], has been a significant driver of demographic and economic outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. The success of immigration policy and public acceptance are closely tied to the perception of government control and effective management of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:46">[02:42:46]</a>. Maintaining this balance amidst evolving challenges like population aging, the housing crisis, and unauthorized migration will continue to shape Australia's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.

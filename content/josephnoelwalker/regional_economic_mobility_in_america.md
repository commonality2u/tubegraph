Regional economic mobility in the United States, traditionally a hallmark of its dynamic economy, involves individuals moving between different areas to improve their economic standing. This movement is primarily driven by the search for higher wages, which are directly linked to higher productivity in certain regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

## The Economic Logic of Mobility

The fundamental economic principle behind both international [[economic_benefits_of_immigration | immigration]] and internal migration is that individuals move from places where their productivity is low to places where it is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. When a worker moves from a less productive environment (e.g., a primitive farm) to a more productive one (e.g., a modern, mechanized farm), their earnings can skyrocket overnight due to increased output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. This concept extends beyond manual labor; even a shoe shiner from a low-productivity area like Haiti becomes more productive in a place like Miami because they are saving customers more valuable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

The economic benefit of this movement is not just for the individual but for society as a whole, as higher productivity leads to more goods and services for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Historical Trends in US Internal Migration

Traditionally, the United States has seen significant internal migration, with no legal restrictions on moving within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This allowed individuals from "backwards low wage places" to relocate to "advanced" areas, such as moving from rural Mississippi to the Bay Area, in pursuit of better opportunities and higher wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

During earlier periods, notably from the 1940s to the 1970s, [[historical_trends_in_us_internal_migration | huge populations moved to California]] from low-wage areas, particularly the South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This migration was generally successful for most people, leading to higher-paid jobs and improved living standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Both low and high-skilled workers participated in this movement, driven by the lure of higher pay in more developed regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## The Modern Challenge: Falling Mobility

Despite continued large gaps in measured productivity between different regions of the US, internal mobility has significantly declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Research by economists Ganong and Shoag reveals a peculiar modern trend:
*   **High-skilled workers** still tend to move from low-productivity areas to high-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Low-skilled workers**, however, are increasingly moving in reverse, leaving high-wage areas like San Francisco for places like Texas where their wages are lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

This counterintuitive movement is primarily explained by [[impact_of_housing_costs_on_worker_relocation | the enormous housing prices in high-productivity areas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.

### The Impact of Housing Costs

Historically, there was not a significant difference in housing costs between high and low-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. However, in the modern era, housing costs in productive areas are so high that low-skilled workers find their percentage wage gains are negated or even surpassed by the extra cost of housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

Workers prioritize their standard of living, which considers wages minus the cost of living, with housing being the largest variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. This means that unless the wage gains are substantial enough to offset the exorbitant housing expenses, relocating to a high-productivity area may not improve a low-skilled worker's net financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

## Restoring Mobility Through Housing Deregulation

The argument is that if housing costs could be reduced to more reasonable levels, the traditional pattern of workers across all skill levels moving to areas with higher wages would be restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. The decline in mobility is strongly linked to increased housing regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

[[housing_deregulation_and_productivity | Housing deregulation]] could lead to significant productivity gains by enabling workers to move to places where they can be more productive, even if the gains are not as dramatic as those seen in international [[economic_benefits_of_immigration | immigration]] (where wages can increase tenfold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. While the productivity differences between regions like the Bay Area and the rural South might offer a 20-30% wage gain, it is still substantial enough to incentivize significant mobility if housing costs were not a prohibitive barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.

From: [[josephnoelwalker]] <br/> 

Podcast host Joe employs an "extremely unusual process" for preparing for his interviews, which Andy Matuschak describes as an "athlete of learning along some really unusual axis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. His preparation is motivated by the "extremely concrete thing" of conducting an excellent conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Preparation Philosophy and Scale
Joe's core approach involves an immense investment of time and a focus on deep understanding, aiming to [[impact_of_thorough_preparation_on_interviews | earn the guest's respect]] and elicit unique answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. He believes that to get truly valuable information, "you have to morally deserve those answers by putting in the work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

The overarching goal is to avoid asking "silly or a waste of time" questions that could lose the guest's respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. He also strives to understand the material well enough to act as a translator for his audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Interviewer as a "Rising Senior Undergrad"
> Joe aims to reach a level of understanding where he can "pose as not a peer but like a... really interested... Rising senior undergrad... talking to the professor and who can like kind of hold up the conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>. This contrasts with simply showing up with a list of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:46">[01:19:46]</a>.

For a single interview, such as the one with Nassim Nicholas Taleb (TB), Joe's preparation includes:
*   **Non-intensive prep:** Approximately two months of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This included:
    *   Working with a private tutor for five hours every Saturday for eight weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, totaling around 40 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   Completing the Real World Risk Institute course, which was "5 hours every night for two weeks, 10 business days," adding 50 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   This non-intensive phase alone totaled about 90 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   He also considers his eight years of being an "interested reader" of the guest's work as part of this ongoing preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Intensive prep:** One to three weeks before the interview, dedicating 8 to 14 hours a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. For the TB interview, this was about nine days, adding another 100 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

This sums up to roughly 200 hours of focused learning for a single interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Resource Selection and Syllabus Creation
Given the time constraints and the vast amount of material, Joe focuses on "satisficing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. His approach to orienting himself to a new topic involves:
1.  **Consulting Experts for a Syllabus:** He speaks to people who can advise him on a syllabus for the field the guest's work sits within. For TB, he consulted a statistics professor and friends working in finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. He gives them the time constraints (e.g., "two months" to get a "pretty decent undergraduate understanding of probability and statistics") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
2.  **Prioritizing Textbook Chapters:** He asks the same experts which parts of recommended textbooks are most important and what can be omitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
3.  **Guest-Directed Focus:** Ideally, the guest himself indicates the most important aspects of their work. For TB, Taleb directly told him to focus on Chapter 3 of his technical book, *Statistical Consequences of Fat Tails*, as it was the best distillation of his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.
4.  **Evolving Reading List:** The reading list is "constantly on a day-by-day basis" evolving, as new context is gained during the intensive research sprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. He doesn't make a serious plan in advance because "it has to unfold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. He also uses his "taste" to judge important topics, areas that are difficult to understand, or topics the guest hasn't spoken much about to create "cufact value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

## Study Practices and Tools

### Tutoring and Problem Solving
For the TB interview, Joe worked with two tutors:
*   **Tom (Physics background):** They worked through probability textbooks (Blissett and Hwang, WAM and All of Statistics, Dorn's 2E Real) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, often solving practice problems together on a whiteboard at a university <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This was often a peer-like relationship, though Tom was more knowledgeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. When stuck, they engaged in "prerequisite chaining," going back to fundamental concepts needed to understand the current material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Aunt (High School Math Teacher):** Joe worked with his aunt to "rebuild from the foundations" while tackling more advanced topics with Tom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>.

### Reading and Note-Taking
Joe primarily reads physical books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. His reading process involves:
*   **Identifying Preconceptions:** He actively looks for ways his initial understanding of questions might be "obviously wrong" or make him "look like a fool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.
*   **Just-in-Time Learning:** While reading, if he encounters unfamiliar concepts (e.g., options trading), he Googles or uses LLMs (Large Language Models) like AI Drive (formerly Claude Projects) for definitions or clarifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. He also messages friends who are experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.
*   **Digital and Physical Integration:** He often has a digital PDF version of the book open on his computer while reading the physical copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:37">[01:32:37]</a>. This allows him to ask LLMs specific questions by referencing page numbers that correspond between his physical and digital versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:15">[01:35:15]</a>.
*   **Handwritten Notes:** He takes handwritten notes on a notepad during tutoring sessions and while reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>. He prefers paper for math work as it allows for drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
*   **Book Tags:** He uses Post-it notes as "book tags" to mark sections he wants to turn into [[role_of_memory_prompts_in_learning | memory prompts]] later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This avoids interrupting his reading flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07">[01:37:07]</a> and allows for consolidation, as some initial ideas might be superseded by clearer explanations later in the chapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:21">[01:41:21]</a>.
*   **Obsidian Notes:** He captures notes and excerpts from his readings into Obsidian, using dedicated notes per book. While sometimes "lazy" by just taking verbatim excerpts due to time constraints, he aims to synthesize information in his own words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:23">[01:40:23]</a>. He also uses these notes to capture "unresolved" questions or areas needing further investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:30">[01:39:30]</a>.

### Memory Prompts and Spaced Repetition
Joe integrates [[role_of_memory_prompts_in_learning | memory prompts]] into his workflow using Obsidian with the Mochi Cards Pro plugin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:43">[01:44:43]</a> and Mochi for spaced repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:47">[01:54:47]</a>.
*   **Writing Prompts:** After finishing a chapter, he goes through his book tags to create prompts, often extracting verbatim excerpts first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>. He separates his prompts at the bottom of his notes to avoid clutter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:55">[01:43:55]</a>.
*   **Benefits of Prompts:**
    *   **Compounding Knowledge:** Prompts from old interviews are leveraged for future ones, making study more "rewarding" and building durable knowledge over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:05">[01:47:05]</a>.
    *   **Daily Improvement:** During intensive sprints, retaining information from prompts makes subsequent days of the sprint easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:07">[01:48:07]</a>.
    *   **Feedback Loop:** Recalling prompts, especially soon after writing them, provides immediate feedback on understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>.
    *   **Motivation:** The daily ritual of reviewing prompts and getting high accuracy is "incredibly rewarding" and provides a "shorter feedback cycle" in an otherwise lonely research process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:09">[01:50:09]</a>. It creates a visible output, signifying progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:29">[01:50:29]</a>.
*   **Prompt Writing Principles:**
    *   **Empathy for Future Self:** Understanding what makes a prompt easy to guess, too ambiguous, or durably useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:26">[01:52:26]</a>.
    *   **Understand Before Memorize:** He generally avoids writing prompts on concepts he doesn't yet understand, with an exception for definitions that help with language acquisition even if full comprehension isn't there yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:08">[01:52:08]</a>.
    *   **Revision:** He revises "5 to 10%" of prompts after writing them if the phrasing is convoluted or unclear, and deletes about 1% that are not necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:09">[01:58:09]</a>. He has a "zero inbox policy" for revisions, doing them on the spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:36">[01:58:36]</a>.
    *   **Contextual Cues:** For specific insights, prompts can include context like "when running a loop around the Berkeley Camp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a> to aid recall.

### Question Generation and Organization
Joe uses the Obsidian Kanban plugin for organizing interview questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:47]</a>.
*   **Dumping Ground:** Questions are initially dumped into an "uncategorized" column <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>, often containing multiple versions or poorly formed ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>.
*   **Categorization:** He organizes questions into columns based on different topics he wants to ask about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. These themes emerge during the prep process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>.
*   **Physical Kanban:** For some interviews (e.g., Steven Wolfram), he uses a physical Kanban board with Post-it notes. Yellow cards represent ideas or points from readings, and pink cards are questions for the guest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:08">[01:26:08]</a>. The physical board allows for 3D interaction and easy rearrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:37">[01:25:37]</a>.
*   **Prioritization and Sequencing:** The Kanban board is crucial for prioritizing and ordering questions to create a logical narrative arc for the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>. Most of this aggressive organization happens a day or two before the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:56">[01:07:56]</a>.
*   **Meta-Notes:** He includes "meta-notes" (like "to practice loading more context into the preface of a question" or the desired number of questions for a 50-minute interview) directly on the Kanban board to serve as reminders during the question crafting phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.
*   **Final Output:** Once organized, questions are copied from Obsidian (which stores the Kanban board in Markdown) into Google Docs for final formatting and printing for the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>.

## Learning from Success and Failure
Joe reflects on both successful and challenging interview experiences:
*   **Kat Caro Interview:** He felt disappointed because he was working full-time and had limited prep time (short trip with three other interviews), feeling he "didn't understand her field in any deep sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49">[01:16:49]</a>. As a strategy, he focused more on her personal story, which was justifiable given it was her first long-form interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_thorough_preparation_on_interviews | impact of thorough preparation on interviews]] on his personal satisfaction.
*   **Steven Wolfram Interview:** He asked a physics question he "didn't really understand" himself, which Wolfram met with "genuinely disdained" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:13">[01:21:13]</a>. This experience led to a rule: "if you don't understand the question, don't ask it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a> and "not asking anything that I'm I'm not like genuinely interested to hear the answer for and able to comprehend the answer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:28">[01:22:28]</a>. This is a form of [[rejection_analysis_in_talent_scouting | rejection analysis]] applied to his own performance.

> [!NOTE] Practical Interviewing Principles
> Joe incorporates general interviewing principles into his spaced repetition system, such as:
> *   "Don't Talk unless you can... improve the silence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.
> *   "Flip the sign" to transform a question into a more interesting one (e.g., "what wouldn't you do in X situation" instead of "what would you do") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:13">[01:11:13]</a>.

## Future Aspirations
Joe recognizes a "growing bifurcation" between the intensive prep process and the final podcast interview, where much of the valuable prep work isn't always visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:05">[01:28:05]</a>.

He aims to share more of his prep process publicly, including:
*   Publishing his Mochi decks (prompts) for interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:46">[01:34:46]</a>.
*   Publishing his Obsidian notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:22">[01:34:22]</a>.
*   Releasing video recordings of himself working and preparing ("fly-on-the-wall" view) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:26">[01:34:26]</a>.
*   Sharing calls with private tutors, being mindful of confidentiality and how recording might change incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:41">[01:34:41]</a>.

His motivation is that the prep is "valuable in and of itself apart from the podcast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:34">[01:29:34]</a>, and making it more efficient allows him to do more interviews and "reach more people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:49">[01:29:49]</a>. This transparency highlights the invisible "knowledge work" involved in serious study, which is often misattributed to talent alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:03">[01:37:03]</a>.

The precautionary principle is an approach to risk management that recommends taking action to prevent harm, even if there is no conclusive scientific evidence of a causal link between an action and its potential adverse effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>. The principle is deeply rooted in the idea of ensuring societal survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.

### Non-Naive Precautionary Principle
There is a distinction between the general precautionary principle and what is termed the "non-naive precautionary principle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. The non-naive version incorporates specific restrictions, focusing on phenomena with multiplicative effects and potential for irreversible, systemic harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:57">[01:12:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>. It aims to identify what is *not* precautionary, rather than broadly stopping all potentially risky endeavors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>.

#### Applications and Distinctions
*   **Technology and Nature**: The principle is applied to certain classes of engineering that can have irreversible effects on nature, particularly when the processes involved are not fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:07">[01:12:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
    *   **Sparrows Example**: The historical Chinese campaign to eliminate sparrows led to unforeseen environmental problems with proliferating insects, demonstrating the dangers of large-scale disruption of nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Power**: Nuclear power is considered *not* to warrant the application of the precautionary principle in the same way as other technologies. This is because small reactors, if they explode, cause localized harm that does not impact distant reactors. The harm is contained rather than systemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.
*   **Pandemics**: Unlike nuclear power, pandemics represent a significant concern for the precautionary principle due to their potential for multiplicative effects and systemic spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>.
*   **GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms)**: The principle is applied against the widespread implementation of GMOs in nature, but not against the research into genetic modification itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>. Research cannot be stopped, but deployment can be restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>.
*   **[[AI applications in economic policy making | Artificial Intelligence]] (AI)**: The application of the precautionary principle to AI is debated. Some argue that as AI technology advances, particularly if it becomes autonomously self-improving, it could pose systemic risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:43">[01:15:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>. However, current AI technology is not seen as warranting this application, as systems can be shut down, and claims about self-reproduction or taking over the world are considered speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:54">[01:15:54]</a>. Constraints on research should only be applied once an event demonstrating the risk actually occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

### Critique and Challenges
A common critique of the precautionary principle is that it could be applied to almost any risk, making it difficult for policy makers to prioritize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>. However, proponents argue that distinguishing between types of risk—especially those with multiplicative effects versus additive ones—is crucial for its proper application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:51">[01:35:51]</a>. Critics also highlight that efforts to deal with risk can sometimes inadvertently increase it by promoting policies based on a poor understanding of [[risk assessment in talent scouting | tail risk]] events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:54">[01:41:54]</a>.

### Relationship to Fat Tails
Understanding fat-tailed distributions is fundamental to applying the precautionary principle effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:16">[01:42:16]</a>. Policies must consider the possibility of extreme, unpredictable events (fat tails) rather than assuming normal (Gaussian) distributions of outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:27">[02:00:27]</a>. This perspective highlights the need for caution when dealing with processes that can generate disproportionately large outcomes, such as contagions or price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

The concept of caring for the distant future hinges on the assertion that life possesses a positive value, rendering the obliteration of all life "as close to self-evidently wrong as we can find a proposition in [[ethics_and_the_value_of_life | ethics]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Why Care?

A primary reason to prioritize the distant future is the understanding that it will be inhabited by a vast number of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Their experiences, whether of pleasure or suffering, "will be no less real" simply because they are distant from us in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This principle is analogous to geographic distance; being physically far away does not diminish a person's worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Discount Rates and Future Value

When evaluating the future, it's crucial to distinguish between discounting financial assets and abstract concepts like happiness or well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. While a positive discount rate is appropriate for cash flows due to opportunity costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, there should be "no discount rate across either short or long time horizons" for "happiness or utility or well-being or that kind of concept" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This consistency across choices ensures that the well-being of future generations is valued equally to our own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Challenges to Future-Oriented Thinking

Caring about the distant future often does not come naturally to most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The main issue is a "fixation on the very soon" and "the immediate present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Shifting this mindset is not impossible, as evidenced by "many highly successful people" and "countries with high savings rates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Cultures with higher savings rates often accumulate income faster than they learn to spend it, alongside a high precautionary demand for savings due to economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## The Great Stagnation and Societal Well-being

The "Great Stagnation," characterized by slowed productivity growth, stagnant wages, and decelerated scientific innovation in the Western world since the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, poses a significant threat to future-oriented thinking. If this stagnation persists or turns into negative growth, societal thinking could switch from positive-sum to zero-sum or even negative-sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This shift is already observable, with economies shrinking and politics becoming "nasty in many countries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Economic growth creates a surplus that helps maintain consensus in democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. Historical periods of zero-sum thinking, like pre-industrial times focused on finite resources such as land, highlight the importance of growth for developing liberal societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

## Addressing Existential Risks

The importance of caring for the distant future is profoundly linked to [[speculations_on_space_colonization_and_existential_risks | existential risks]]. Nick Bostrom's thought experiment on potential future happiness, calculated from the colonization of planets and the development of conscious minds in computers, illustrates the immense value that could be lost if civilization were to destroy itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. He imagines future happiness capable of "fill[ing] and refill[ing] the earth's oceans every second and keep doing so for a hundred billion billion millennia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>.

However, the prospect of long-term human survival, including [[the_potential_for_human_survival_beyond_earth | human survival beyond Earth]], faces skepticism. While some argue for diversifying humanity's presence by establishing colonies on Mars to safeguard against Earth-centric risks, this is countered by arguments that other terrestrial locations, like central Australia, are far more hospitable and easier to govern than a Martian colony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:11">[02:33:11]</a>. Human colonies in space are seen as vulnerable and unlikely to be self-sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:04">[02:40:04]</a>.

Despite the grand visions, the speaker holds a more pessimistic, "naive biological perspective," guessing that humanity would be "lucky to have another thousand years left" on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. The high chance of eventual self-destruction due to factors like weapons of mass destruction means there is "less to preserve" in terms of an infinitely valuable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:18">[01:04:18]</a>. This perspective, though seemingly pessimistic, does not undercut the case for growth maximization; instead, it reframes it. If the time left is limited, the focus shifts to making "those 800 years on Earth as good as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>. This highlights a key [[philosophical_implications_of_longevity | philosophical implication of longevity]]: differing time horizons profoundly change the orientation of actions and priorities.

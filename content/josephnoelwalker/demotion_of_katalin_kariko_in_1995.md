In 1995, [[katalin_karikos_early_career_at_the_university_of_pennsylvania | Katalin Kariko]] was demoted from her faculty position at the University of Pennsylvania due to a failure to secure sufficient grant funding within the institution's five-year policy [00:01:49].

## Early Career and Grant Challenges

From 1989, for the first two years of her employment at the University of Pennsylvania, [[katalin_karikos_early_career_at_the_university_of_pennsylvania | Katalin Kariko]] consistently wrote grant proposals every month to secure funding and establish her laboratory [00:00:06]. She held a faculty position as a research assistant professor, which was a non-tenure track role [00:00:14]. Although this position allowed her to have her own lab, she did not receive any of the grants she applied for [00:00:19].

## Research and Criticisms

[[katalin_karikos_laboratory_work_and_experiments | Kariko]] proposed research involving circular RNA, an idea she pursued in the early 1990s, even though it was considered a novel concept years later [00:00:25]. A grant proposal for this work was rejected around 1992 or 1993 [00:00:30]. Despite working diligently on [[katalin_karikos_laboratory_work_and_experiments | experiments]] and generating data, it was often deemed insufficient [00:00:40]. Critics raised concerns that the RNA was "label" (not useful) and questioned her knowledge for conducting such [[katalin_karikos_laboratory_work_and_experiments | experiments]] [00:00:51]. [[katalin_karikos_laboratory_work_and_experiments | Kariko]] consistently listened to feedback, improving her writing and conducting additional [[katalin_karikos_laboratory_work_and_experiments | experiments]] to address the criticisms [00:01:05].

## University Policy and Demotion

The University of Pennsylvania had a specific rule regarding faculty positions: if a faculty member failed to establish themselves within five years by securing grant money, they faced either promotion or removal from the faculty [00:01:30]. This policy, falling under [[university_policies_on_faculty_promotion_and_tenure | university policies on faculty promotion and tenure]], ultimately led to [[katalin_karikos_early_career_at_the_university_of_pennsylvania | Kariko's]] demotion in 1995 [00:01:49].

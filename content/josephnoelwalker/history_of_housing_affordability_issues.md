For most of human history, essential goods were scarce and, consequently, expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Economic historians note that in 15th-century England, approximately 80% of personal spending was on food, with 20% of that specifically on bread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. However, since the Industrial Revolution, innovation has led to an era of increasing abundance, reflected in the falling price (measured in hours of work) of items from bread to cars and televisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Housing, a durable good, has defied this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The cost of structures people live in, or more precisely the land beneath them, continues to rise, even as prices for household goods fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This has led to significant [[economic_and_social_consequences_of_unaffordable_housing | economic and social consequences of unaffordable housing]].

## Housing Affordability in Australia

Australia has experienced a significant increase in housing costs. Over the last 25 years, Australia's house price-to-income ratio has roughly tripled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. According to the latest Demographia report, Sydney and Melbourne are the second and seventh least affordable cities globally, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

This [[economic_and_social_consequences_of_unaffordable_housing | unaffordable housing market]] has several negative impacts:
*   Many people live too far from their most productive jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   Individuals shoulder enormous debts or face the precarity of renting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   People cannot live close to friends or relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   It delays family formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   It contributes to urban sprawl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Australia's [[causes_of_the_housing_crisis_in_Australia | housing crisis]] is considered a defining social policy disaster of the current era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## [[causes_of_the_housing_crisis_in_Australia | Causes of the Housing Crisis in Australia]]

The primary issue identified is a [[causes_of_the_housing_crisis_in_Australia | constricted housing supply]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This problem is not unique to Australia, also being prevalent in the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Ireland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Common Factors in the Anglosphere
*   **Immigration Rates**: Many English-speaking countries share high rates of [[relationship_between_immigration_and_housing | immigration]], which places stronger and clearer pressures on housing supply compared to other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This is a partial answer, with many exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Local Control Emphasis**: A common argument is that the English-speaking tradition of government and culture emphasizes local control, granting neighboring residents significant say over what can be built on private property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This leads to various problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Evolution of Zoning Regulations
Zoning regulations began to pose significant problems for countries like Australia around the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   During the 1960s and 1970s, Australia experienced strong population growth, alongside the increased adoption of cars, which facilitated inexpensive car-based sprawl into attractive suburbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   As commutes lengthened, the need to build "up" rather than "out" became apparent, especially as cities like Melbourne and Sydney grew to millions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   Building "up" encounters more severe and difficult-to-circumvent zoning restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   There isn't one dramatic legislative change that caused this; rather, it's an unfortunate combination of factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Demand for housing has consistently increased by about 3% per year, while supply has only increased by about 2% per year, leading to continually rising prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Motivations Behind Opposition to Development (NIMBYism)
Two main motivations are observed in the literature for Not In My Backyard (NIMBY) opposition:
1.  **Home Voter Hypothesis**: NIMBYs selfishly try to protect their home equity values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
2.  **Neighborhood Defenders Hypothesis**: NIMBYs act altruistically to protect their neighborhood's amenity and local character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

Statistical evidence suggests the "Neighborhood Defenders" story is more important, as many renters also act as NIMBYs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This often stems from a "fear of the unknown" or "status quo bias," where people worry developments will be worse than they are and often change their minds once the development is built and they experience its benefits like new cafes and bus services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. However, some opposition involves bad faith, with unstated motivations including a dislike of new people, partly for ethnic or class reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. The financial impact of housing prices makes it difficult to convince a majority of voters that lower prices would be beneficial, as their wealth is tied to housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Tax Concessions and Credit Expansion
The interaction of negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount (introduced in 1999) disproportionately favored property investment, making it seem like a new fundamental value for housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>. However, this is considered a minor factor compared to global trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>. Global falling interest rates, especially long-term rates, are a significant explanation for house price increases observed worldwide, particularly in English-speaking countries like Canada, the US, UK, and New Zealand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. While there are good reasons to revisit tax concessions for equity and fiscal policy, they are not the main driver of housing affordability issues today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.

Regarding [[housing_credit_expansion | housing credit expansion]], the financial system's role needs careful consideration. While large collapses in housing values can have catastrophic effects (as seen in the GFC), ensuring strong capital requirements for banks is the appropriate policy response, regardless of housing supply levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:42">[01:29:42]</a>. Inefficient credit obstacles, such as APRA's financial regulations, can prevent mutually advantageous trades between borrowers and lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>. While expanding credit can boost prices, it should be coupled with measures to boost supply or reduce other demand-supporting measures like first-homeowner grants for welfare improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:30">[01:32:30]</a>.

## [[potential_solutions_for_increasing_housing_supply | Potential Solutions for Increasing Housing Supply]]

### Reforming Zoning Regulations
Key zoning regulations identified for reform include:
*   **Height Restrictions**: Considered the worst type of restriction, especially around train stations where demand for high-density housing is high and changes less of the neighborhood character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:59">[01:12:59]</a>. This aligns with standard planning literature advocating for transit-oriented development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.
*   **Heritage Restrictions**: While not universally critical, they are deemed "stupid" for protecting vast areas, sometimes entire suburbs, of architecturally ordinary housing without considering costs or benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:44">[01:13:44]</a>.

An additional critical reform is to **allow medium and high-density housing in areas currently zoned for detached, single-family homes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:32">[01:16:32]</a>. New Zealand has led the world in this, particularly by allowing townhouses in vast areas of Auckland and Wellington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>. This has doubled construction and led to a 21-28% fall in prices in specific municipalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.

### The YIMBY Movement and its Objectives
The YIMBY (Yes In My Backyard) movement is a broad coalition united by the belief that more housing supply will improve affordability, which is a top social problem in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:59">[01:29:59]</a>.

*   **Affordability vs. Agglomeration**: There's a perceived tension between making housing more affordable by increasing supply and gaining from agglomeration by densifying cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:25">[01:24:25]</a>. Increased supply and densification can make cities more attractive, leading to higher incomes and potentially pushing up prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>. However, proponents argue supply effects dominate agglomeration effects, and productivity gains are crucial for living standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>.
*   **Aesthetics and Architecture**: A critique of the YIMBY movement is its perceived neglect of aesthetics and architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37">[01:27:37]</a>. While beauty is important for public acceptance, especially when new developments replace older buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:04">[01:28:04]</a>, legislating "beauty" is challenging given historical patterns of "ugly buildings" in English-speaking traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on practical aspects like street trees, which significantly increase the attractiveness of neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:17">[01:32:17]</a>. Burying overhead wires during upzoning makes planting tall trees feasible and beneficial long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:48">[01:32:48]</a>.

### Policy Goals and Targets
The aim is for housing to be much more affordable, defined as a lower ratio of prices or rents to incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:34">[01:41:34]</a>. This could be achieved by holding prices and rents flat while incomes rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:48">[01:41:48]</a>.

The **National Cabinet Target of 1.2 million homes over five years** is considered a sensible short-term objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:41">[01:41:41]</a>.
*   This target is 200,000 homes above a baseline of 1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.
*   It represents a 2% increase in the national housing stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:26">[01:42:26]</a>.
*   A rough rule of thumb suggests every 1% increase in housing stock reduces costs by about 2.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:55">[01:42:55]</a>. Thus, the 2% increment could lead to a **5% reduction in affordability** relative to a baseline of continuously rising house prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:30">[01:42:30]</a>.
*   This is an ambitious but feasible target, given that construction at this rate has occurred before and was politically accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>.
*   The construction industry's capacity is a constraint, making rapid increases difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>. However, the industry is cyclical and has adapted to booms in the past, drawing workers from other sectors through adjustments in wages, immigration, and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.

### Political and Social Challenges
[[challenges_and_strategies_in_addressing_housing_affordability_in_Australia | Addressing housing affordability]] is a generational problem that will take time to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:51">[01:46:51]</a>. While the prospect of house prices not growing quickly might worry some homeowners, many are already wealthy and their children's access to housing is a key motivator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:19">[01:52:19]</a>. Homeowners care about their children and the unfairness of the current market that locks younger generations out of opportunities their parents had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:21">[01:52:21]</a>.

A major obstacle is "supply skepticism," where a significant portion of the public believes increased housing supply will raise or keep prices the same, rather than lowering them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. This likely stems from observing new developments being built in response to strong demand, leading to a perceived correlation between supply and high prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>.

Historically, state governments have been reluctant to confront local councils over development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>. However, New South Wales and Victorian governments are now committed to housing policies opposed by some councils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>. The success of these policies depends on the political will to enforce targets, ideally through pre-specified automatic remedies in legislation, rather than relying on politicians' courage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>.

### Interstate Migration and Housing Costs
High [[housing_costs_and_migration_patterns | housing costs]] can drive internal migration. For example, many young, dynamic, and entrepreneurial people are leaving Sydney for other states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>. This outflow negatively impacts the city's productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>. Price differentials, more than productivity differentials, are the main driver of interstate migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:11">[01:14:11]</a>. This underscores the need for coordinated upzoning efforts across states, potentially with central government involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>.

### Integration of Transport and Housing Policies
Integrating transport and housing decisions is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:19">[01:25:19]</a>. New rail lines should always be accompanied by high-density housing at stations, as public transport and housing density are complementary goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>. Federal government subsidies for transport projects should be contingent on high-density development at train stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:21">[01:26:21]</a>. The federal opposition's policy of spending $5 billion on housing-friendly infrastructure (roads and sewage, the biggest infrastructure needs) aligns with coupling infrastructure spending with housing development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:56">[01:26:56]</a>.

### Future Outlook
While achieving significant short-term price reductions is challenging, sustained efforts to increase supply can lead to substantial improvements over time. The problem developed over generations and will take time to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:51">[01:48:51]</a>. If housing supply remains unresponsive, cities could face outcomes similar to San Francisco, Manhattan, or London, characterized by extreme unaffordability, homelessness, severe social divisions, and a decline in productivity as young, dynamic people leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:57">[01:22:57]</a>. The current trajectory suggests things "can always get worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:04">[01:24:04]</a>.

There is significant, growing agreement among economists and a grassroots movement (YIMBY) on the need for increased housing supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:05">[01:56:05]</a>. However, key figures, particularly academics in town planning and architecture, remain skeptical of relying on market forces to improve affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:01">[01:55:01]</a>.

Ultimately, building housing of any type and in any location will make housing throughout the entire market more affordable due to substitutability between different kinds of housing (e.g., old vs. new, luxury vs. market, dense vs. detached) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:06">[01:42:06]</a>.

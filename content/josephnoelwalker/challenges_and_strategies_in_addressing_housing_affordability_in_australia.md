Australia is currently facing a significant [[causes_of_the_housing_crisis_in_australia | housing affordability crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:50">[03:51:50]</a>. This issue has arisen due to high levels of immigration over the past couple of decades interacting with an inelastic housing supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:50">[03:51:50]</a>.

## The Long Road to Resolving the Housing Crisis

Addressing the [[causes_of_the_housing_crisis_in_australia | housing crisis]] by focusing primarily on increasing supply is a long-term endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:21">[03:21:21]</a>.

[!WARNING] **Timeframe for Supply-Side Solutions**
Even with an extremely ambitious supply-side policy – one more aggressive than the national cabinet's target of 1.2 million homes over five years – it would still take 10 to 20 years to bring prices down in Sydney and Melbourne by approximately 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>. This assumes a 1% increase in the housing stock per year above the normal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:07">[03:37:07]</a>.

### Understanding Supply-Side Constraints

"Zoning" broadly refers to planning restrictions, including heritage and height restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:56">[03:29:56]</a>. Completely liberalizing these markets could hypothetically lead to price falls of up to 40% in Sydney and Melbourne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:08">[03:30:08]</a>. However, such an extreme measure is not realistic or on the policy agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:09">[03:38:09]</a>.

### Current Government Targets and Their Impact

The National Cabinet's target of 1.2 million new homes over five years is considered a sensible and feasible short-term objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:50">[03:34:50]</a>. This target aims to sustain the previous peak in construction rates seen before the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:50">[03:34:50]</a>.

The 1.2 million homes target represents an additional 200,000 homes above a baseline of 1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:12">[03:35:12]</a>. Given Australia's national housing stock of approximately 11 million homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:31">[03:35:31]</a>, this 200,000 increase equates to about a 2% increase in the national housing stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:39">[03:35:39]</a>.

[!NOTE] **Impact on Affordability**
A rough rule of thumb suggests that every percentage point increase in the housing stock reduces the cost of housing by about 2.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:45">[03:35:45]</a>. Therefore, the 2% increment targeted by the National Cabinet would lead to a 5% reduction in affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:54">[03:35:54]</a>. This reduction is relative to a baseline where housing prices are trending upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:04">[03:36:04]</a>, meaning prices would still increase in nominal terms but at a slower rate than they would without the policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:33">[03:36:33]</a>.

### Challenges in Implementation

Achieving these targets requires relatively modest changes in the built form of cities, such as local councils approving more blocks of flats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:50">[03:38:50]</a>. The New South Wales and Victorian governments are setting ambitious targets for councils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:30">[03:39:30]</a>. However, there's a concern that councils might still refuse applications once plans are lodged, leading to potential disputes between state governments and councils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:40">[03:39:40]</a>. To ensure compliance, it is suggested that state governments pre-announce automatic remedies for councils that do not meet their targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>.

## Broader Economic and Social Context

The slow pace of solving the [[causes_of_the_housing_crisis_in_australia | housing crisis]] is concerning given its negative impacts on productivity and fertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

### The Joint Problem of Housing and Productivity

The [[economic_and_social_consequences_of_unaffordable_housing | housing crisis]] is intertwined with [[economic_inequality_trends_in_australia | Australia's productivity challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:51">[03:49:51]</a>:
*   **Productivity Improvement:** It is vital for more people to afford to live and work in major agglomerations to improve national productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:56">[03:54:56]</a>.
*   **Political Palatability:** To make potential house price falls more politically palatable, there is a need for rising incomes and stronger productivity growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:12">[03:44:12]</a>.

### Immigration and Demography
Immigration has been a significant factor influencing housing demand. The primary objective of Australian immigration policy over the past couple of decades has been to slow the rate of population aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This demographic goal comprised approximately 80% of the motivation for the 2001 changes that significantly increased Australia's intake of skilled migrants, especially overseas students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. This policy was also seen as a way to attract skills, generate export income, and provide a budget benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:38">[03:35:38]</a>. The link between [[link_between_immigration_policy_and_australias_demographic_challenges | immigration policy and Australia's demographic challenges]] is therefore a critical consideration for [[housing_costs_and_migration_patterns | housing costs and migration patterns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Political Constraints on Housing Supply

The political feasibility of ambitious housing policies is challenged by the fact that housing has become a primary means of wealth creation for the middle class in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Without an alternative vision for wealth creation for homeowning constituents, the supply-side agenda faces a slow, decades-long grind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Resolving the [[causes_of_the_housing_crisis_in_australia | Australian housing affordability crisis]] will require a sustained effort over many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. This includes increasing housing supply, enhancing the capacity of the construction industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>, and addressing the political and cultural factors that influence planning and development. The discussion on [[potential_solutions_for_increasing_housing_supply | potential solutions for increasing housing supply]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:50">[03:09:50]</a> must consider these complex interdependencies.

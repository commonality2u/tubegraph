Australia's [[australian_immigration_policy_and_population_aging | immigration policy]] has undergone significant transformations, particularly with regulatory changes introduced by the Howard government in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. These changes, which largely went unnoticed at the time, increased Australia's immigration intake to levels not seen since the post-War "populate and perish" era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The primary goal was to boost the skill level of migrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. An innovative solution involved massively expanding the intake of international students and working holiday makers, with the idea that these individuals would upskill and then be eligible to apply for permanent residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This approach proved successful, with over 2 million international students and working holiday makers coming to Australia in the two decades since, many settling permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. In recent years, international students have comprised over 40% of annual net migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Perceptions of Government Control

A significant challenge in managing migration policy is the public's perception of government control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. There is a tendency to believe that the government has day-to-day control over migration numbers, which is not the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Policy changes often take years to manifest their full effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. For example, the boom in net migration in recent years resulted from policy decisions made during and before the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. While the Albanese government may have been slow to respond, the underlying factors were already in motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Net overseas migration (NOM) is the relevant metric, defined as the number of people entering for 12 out of 16 months minus those leaving for the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. NOM includes both permanent and temporary migration programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. While the permanent program is capped by the government, the temporary program (e.g., international students, working holiday makers) is demand-driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This demand-driven component often accounts for a larger portion of overall net migration, leading to situations where the government "loses control" of the numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Other groups contributing to NOM include New Zealand citizens moving in and out freely, and Australian citizens who leave or return for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Impact of Losing Control on Public Perception

When net migration appears "out of control," like it did in recent years, public attitudes against migration tend to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. This leads to concerns about the capacity of infrastructure and service delivery to keep pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>. There is a consensus among the political elite that maintaining a perception of control over illegal immigration allows for a more open legal migration program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. If the public believes the government is in control, they are more likely to accept higher levels of net migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.

## Challenges in Migration Control

### Asylum Claims and Unresolved Cases
A significant challenge to control emerged around 2015-2016 with a labor trafficking scam, leading to a surge in asylum applications, predominantly from Malaysia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. Many of these claims were opportunistic rather than genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. The backlog of these applications grew substantially, only slowing down with the closure of international borders during COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

As of a recent estimate, about 100,000 individuals in Australia have exhausted their visa options and "shouldn't be in the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Dealing with this group is complex:
*   **Preventing growth:** Fast-tracking genuine asylum applications and identifying/prosecuting organizers of scams is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. The Labor government invested in faster processing, stabilizing the backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.
*   **Dealing with the existing population:** Mass deportations are economically and logistically unfeasible, leading to immense costs, disruption, and likely failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. Detention facilities for such numbers would be enormous and resource-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.
*   **Amnesty considerations:** Many of these individuals were manipulated by organizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. A "subtle pathway" to permanent residency might be a pragmatic solution, as mass deportation costs would far outweigh any political backlash of such an "amnesty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. An example of this was the "one November category" in 1993, which provided a pathway to permanent residency for 40,000-50,000 Chinese students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

### Exploitation of Migrants
[[challenges_and_strategies_in_managing_migrant_integration | Exploitation of migrants]] is a persistent issue in immigration policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:30">[01:24:30]</a>. Labor trafficking is the second-largest criminal enterprise globally, after drug trafficking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:14">[01:29:14]</a>. The system can inherently bake in exploitation, particularly in low-skill visa programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

Strategies to minimize exploitation include:
*   **Empowering migrants:** Giving individual migrants greater agency and power, such as enabling easier employer changes for those on employer-sponsored visas, can reduce an employer's capacity to exploit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:48">[01:24:48]</a>.
*   **Stronger penalties:** While criminal penalties for exploitation have been introduced, the criteria for conviction remain opaque, limiting their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:18">[01:25:18]</a>.
*   **Minimum wage enforcement:** Freezing the minimum wage for employer-sponsored visas (as happened between 2013-2022) increased exploitation risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:56">[01:26:56]</a>. Increasing this minimum wage helps, but no single solution exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:08">[01:27:08]</a>.
*   **Union empowerment:** Empowering unions to assist temporary migrants and encouraging union membership could provide protection against exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:51">[01:27:51]</a>.

### Housing Market Impact
[[the_relationship_between_immigration_housing_and_economic_growth | Immigration contributes to the demand side of the housing market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. International students primarily impact housing near universities and in CBDs, and working holiday makers affect backpacker hostel accommodation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. They have little impact in suburban areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>. While their contribution to housing demand is real, many other factors contribute to the housing crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>. Most international students rent or live in student accommodation and typically cannot afford to buy homes in major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

## Policy Objectives and Design
The primary objective of Australia's immigration policy should be to slow the rate of [[australian_immigration_policy_and_population_aging | population aging]] over the next 50-100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. While Australia will age, slowing the rate allows for better adjustment for businesses and government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This demographic consideration was a key motivator for the 2001 policy changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

A "population plan" that commits to future population goals and integrates all relevant policy areas is crucial but has never truly existed in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.

### Skilled Migration and Labor Markets
[[economic_benefits_of_immigration | Immigration]] impacts both the demand and supply sides of the labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. While oversupply in specific labor market segments could theoretically depress wages, areas like aged care and healthcare currently face significant staff shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. High-skilled migrants often create demand for less-skilled support staff, providing employment opportunities for native workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:47">[01:13:47]</a>.

Australia's skill stream is composed of four major groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>:
1.  **Employer-sponsored category:** Managed on a demand-driven basis, with employers making selections based on business fit, subject to minimum criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. This category generally outperforms others economically and budgetarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.
2.  **State-sponsored (metro):** States select migrants based on their specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>.
3.  **Regional category:** Offers concessions against standard criteria to encourage settlement in regional areas with significant demographic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>.
4.  **Points-tested category:** The dominant role of federal bureaucrats, where a higher pass mark correlates with greater migrant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>.

Regarding international students, a standardized entrance exam was proposed in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:40">[01:31:40]</a>. This would offer a more objective, certain, and fair process than the current "genuine student" criterion, which relies on subjective visa decision-maker judgment and leads to uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:02">[01:32:02]</a>. This approach would also allow the government to control numbers more sensibly than through arbitrary caps on providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:10">[01:36:10]</a>.

## Public Perceptions and Challenges

### Backlash and Scapegoating
A negative mood has developed around immigration in Australia, partly because when economic conditions are difficult, such as high housing costs, people tend to adopt a "zero-sum mindset" and blame immigrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This is a common historical pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.

### Political Discourse
Politicians often present immigration as an "Australia first" or "America first" concept for political advantage, even if they know it's not entirely true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. However, a successful migrant generally helps Australia prosper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Bipartisan Support and its Fragility
Since 1945, Australia has largely benefited from bipartisan support for immigration and multiculturalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>. This long-standing political consensus is considered a key factor in Australia's successful integration of diverse populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>. However, there is a risk that this bipartisan support could erode in future elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.

## Australia's Unique Position and State Capacity

Australia is a uniquely multicultural developed nation, with about 30% of its population born overseas—the highest rate in the developed world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Australia also boasts one of the youngest and most multicultural populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This success is partly attributed to the country's "weird" (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) culture, which is shared by many high-skilled migrants who are educated in similarly "weird" ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:56">[00:56:56]</a>. Educating migrants within Australian universities further integrates them into the local culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>.

Australia's state capacity in immigration is rooted in unique historical decisions:
*   **Universal Visa System and Electronic Travel Authority (ETA):** Australia introduced a universal visa system and ETA in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:34">[01:16:34]</a>. This allowed for real-time tracking of people entering and leaving the country, providing greater control over who is in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:46">[01:17:46]</a>. This involved deep integration with airline reservation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>.
*   **Dedicated Immigration Department:** Australia established a standalone immigration department in 1945, which lasted until 2015-2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This fostered a strong corporate memory and culture within the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a>. However, a shift in 2015-2016 reoriented the department's primary objective from "nation-building" to "National Security," leading to a staff dominated by defense and law enforcement backgrounds rather than those focused on development and integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:04">[01:20:04]</a>.

## International Comparisons

*   **Japan:** Japan is significantly older and smaller than Australia, with a median age of 47-48 and a declining population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. They would be "smaller, whiter Japan" without mass migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Japanese politicians traditionally promoted monoculturalism, making it hard to advocate for immigration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>. However, facing stark demographic realities (fertility rate around 1.1-1.2, median age 48), Japan is now adopting visa policies similar to Australia's, including points-tested and employer-sponsored categories, and exploring low-skill programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:42">[01:02:42]</a>. They are particularly interested in Australia's Settlement Services, including the Adult Migrant English Program, as integrating migrants into Japan's monocultural society and overcoming language barriers are major challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. Japan, like China, is predicted to become much more multicultural out of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:53">[01:04:53]</a>.

*   **Canada:** Traditionally seen as a model for successful migration, Canada's recent experience highlights the risks of losing control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>. An excessive migration and temporary entry program led to public backlash, with the Canadian government now projecting negative population growth as a deliberate policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:39">[01:32:39]</a>.

*   **United Kingdom:** The UK has seen growing intolerance towards immigration, even with a semblance of control, due to high numbers and concerns about the cultural mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a>. Political rhetoric about "irreducible minimum" migration numbers has fueled public angst when forecasts are missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:15">[01:45:15]</a>.

*   **United States:** The US faces its own [[immigration_challenges_to_america | immigration challenges to America]], with debates around mass deportation proposals that are deemed economically and logistically unfeasible, leading to immense costs and likely failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>.

## Future Considerations

To maintain public confidence and ensure sustained benefits, Australia should aim for a net migration target in the range of 200,000-300,000 people per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:19">[01:42:19]</a>. This range is considered optimum for slowing the rate of [[australian_immigration_policy_and_population_aging | population aging]] and yields the best [[economic_benefits_of_immigration | economic benefits of immigration]] and budget outcomes, while also demonstrating government control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>.

Despite its successes, there is a lack of high-quality, current [[challenges_and_strategies_in_managing_migrant_integration | research on immigration policy]] in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. The abolition of the Bureau of Immigration Research and the redirection of funding towards law enforcement in the Home Affairs model have left a void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. Universities and business groups have also shown little interest in funding dedicated immigration research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>. This lack of recent research may hinder future policy debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>.

The journey to America for the speaker in 1985 began after learning at her 30th birthday that she had six months left at her institute and needed to find a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This was her first time being "kicked out," a recurring theme she attributes to her eventual success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. She emphasizes the importance of not taking such setbacks personally, focusing instead on what to do next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Restrictions and Initial Challenges

Moving to America from communist Hungary in 1985 was not easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The Hungarian authorities sought to prevent defection by severely limiting what emigrants could take with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The speaker, her husband, and their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter were only allowed to take $50 for the daughter and $50 for the husband, with the speaker expected to ask her employer for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This meant a family of three would embark on a new life with only $100, a deliberate tactic to limit movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Unofficial Means to Survive

To overcome these strict limitations, the family resorted to unofficial means to acquire more funds. They sold their Russian car on the black market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Officially, they could sell the car, but the money exchange had to occur on the black market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. They exchanged money with students from Arabic countries, receiving pounds instead of dollars, which amounted to an equivalent of $800 to $1200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Navigating Currency Controls

Hungarian currency was not convertible, meaning one could not freely exchange it for foreign currency like the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. If one received foreign currency, it was legally required to be given to the bank in exchange for Hungarian currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Possessing foreign currency was against the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

The $1,000 equivalent they managed to acquire was a substantial sum for their escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

To bring this extra money out of Hungary, the family employed a common strategy among emigrants: [[strategies_for_smuggling_money | smuggling money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The speaker wrapped the money and stitched it into her daughter Susan's teddy bears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. At the airport, they had to be vigilant to ensure the bear was not left behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Their daughter, being only two and a half years old, was unaware of the money hidden within her toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Many other Hungarians also had to find ways to bring extra money out, as coming to America with only $100 was not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

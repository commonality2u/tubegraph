The selection of a specific inflation target, such as 2%, can appear somewhat arbitrary, similar to how the initial 8% [[Comparison between inflation targets and capital requirements | Basel Capital requirements]] were set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These figures are chosen to be a "reasonable thing," not too close to zero and not so high that inflation becomes readily noticeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Rationale Behind the 2% Inflation Target

The 2% inflation target is considered a level where some inflation exists, but it typically goes unnoticed by the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Studies suggest that inflation generally becomes a significant problem when it reaches double digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This leaves a considerable margin between the 2% target and problematic inflation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

The primary concern with higher inflation is its potential to "get a life of its own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. A low inflation target, like 2%, aims to keep prices anchored, ensuring that price movements are primarily relative (e.g., one good's price changes compared to another's) rather than absolute (a generalized increase in all prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. At higher inflation levels, relative price movements can quickly turn into absolute price movements, leading to more widespread inflation influenced by specific events like oil price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Ultimately, the exact number chosen for an inflation target may be less critical than its consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. What matters more is that the target is kept low and consistently achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Challenges in Adjusting Inflation Targets

Adjusting an established inflation target, such as moving from 2% to 4%, presents significant [[Challenges in adjusting inflation targets | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. If inflation is already well above 2%, proposing a higher target can be perceived as an admission of defeatâ€”that the central bank cannot bring inflation back down to its original goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Pre-Pandemic Central Bank Policies

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, central banks like the Federal Reserve faced the opposite problem: inflation that was consistently too low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. For about a decade prior, the Fed's inflation hovered around 1.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. During this period, the Fed largely disregarded suggestions to raise its target to 4% because it seemed illogical to increase the goal when the existing 2% target couldn't be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Instead of changing the numerical target, the Fed altered its policy framework to be more accommodating of inflation, aiming to bring it up to the 2% goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This highlights that while the specific number might be somewhat arbitrary, its placement below the public's "radar screen" is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

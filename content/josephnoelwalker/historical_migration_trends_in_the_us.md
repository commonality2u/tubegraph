Traditionally, there have been no legal limitations on moving within the United States, allowing individuals to relocate from one state or region to another without permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:44">[02:42:44]</a>. This internal mobility was a common feature of the US economy.

## Historical Mobility Driven by Productivity

Historically, people frequently moved from areas with lower wages and perceived as "backwards" to more "advanced" regions where they could earn higher pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This phenomenon was driven by the principle that workers' productivity, and thus their earning potential, was higher in more developed areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:02">[04:01:02]</a>.

Examples of this historical migration include:
*   Movement from rural Mississippi to the Bay Area or California to secure a better life and higher-paid jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   Both low and high-skilled workers relocating from low-wage areas, particularly the US South, to higher-wage areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   The "famous giant move to California" occurred during the 1940s, 50s, 60s, and 70s, involving significant populations relocating to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. This movement was generally positive for most people, leading to higher-paying jobs and improved living conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

## Modern Trends and Challenges

Despite significant [[regional_productivity_disparities_in_the_us | regional productivity disparities in the US]], mobility within the country has substantially declined in modern times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Research by economists Ganong and Shoag indicates a shift in migration patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>:
*   High-skilled individuals continue to move from low-productivity areas to high-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   However, low-skilled workers are now moving in the reverse direction, leaving high-wage areas like San Francisco for places like Texas where wages are lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

### The Role of Housing Costs

This reversal in migration patterns for low-skilled workers is primarily attributed to the [[housing_costs_and_migration_patterns | high cost of housing]] in high-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. The enormous housing prices in these regions mean that workers need to be quite high-skilled for the percentage wage gains to outweigh the additional housing expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. Workers prioritize their standard of living, which is calculated as wages minus the cost of living, with housing costs being the largest factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

Historically, before the period of increased housing regulation, there was not a significant difference in housing costs between high and low-productivity areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. Restoring housing costs to reasonable levels could re-establish the traditional pattern of workers across all skill levels moving to areas with higher wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. While the gains from internal US migration might not be as dramatic as those from international immigration (where wages can multiply by a factor of 10), the [[regional_productivity_disparities_in_the_us | productivity differences]] between areas like the Bay Area and the rural South are still substantial enough that reasonable [[housing_costs_and_migration_patterns | housing costs]] in high-wage areas would likely lead to significant mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

The discussion about comparing human intelligence and AI learning techniques is a crucial topic as it brings into sharper focus the fundamental differences and similarities between these two systems. Examining this comparison allows us to assess current AI capabilities and ponder the future trajectory towards achieving [[artificial_general_intelligence_agi_and_its_implications_for_mathematics | Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)]].

## Intelligence vs. Memorization

François Chollet, an AI researcher and creator of Keras, notably points out that intelligence differs significantly from memorization. AI systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are often mistaken for intelligent because of their vast memorization capacity. They are likened to "big interpolative databases," concentrating on memory rather than true intelligence, which involves facing novel situations and adapting effectively [[limitations_of_large_language_models_in_solving_novel_tasks | Limitations of LLMs in Novel Situations]].

Human intelligence, by contrast, thrives on the ability to adapt to the unknown and solve new problems in real-time. As Chollet explains, "intelligence is what you use when you don't know what to do." This notion emphasizes the human capacity to operate without prior memorization or direct training on every specific task they encounter.

## The ARC Benchmark

One crisp way to understand these differences is through the ARC benchmark, which Chollet describes as a kind of IQ test for machine intelligence. Unlike conventional LLM benchmarks resistant to memorization, ARC requires minimal prior knowledge. It depends on "core knowledge," akin to the basic understanding a young child possesses, such as object permanence and fundamental physics. This benchmark poses novel problems that even a comprehensive internet memory cannot solve [[understanding_arc_benchmarks_and_its_significance | Understanding ARC Benchmarks and Its Significance]].

## Human-Like Learning: More than Scaling

Chollet remains skeptical about scaling LLMs alone achieving AGI. Despite their robust performance in memorization-based tasks, these models are not yet capable of on-the-fly synthesis or tackling novelty—an expected hallmark of human intelligence [[ai_scaling_and_its_effectiveness | Challenges in AI Scaling]].

## Systems 1 and 2: Human Cognition vs. AI

Humans utilize a mixture of System 1 (intuitive thinking) and System 2 (deliberate reasoning) for complex problem solving, where intuition and pattern recognition play vital roles. AI researchers suggest that a fusion of deep learning (for intuition) and program synthesis (for reasoning) approaches might one day enable machines to emulate this human cognitive ability [[neuroscience_insights_on_intelligence_and_ai | Neuroscience Insights on Intelligence and AI]].

## Pathfinding in Life’s Novel Situations

Chollet utilizes the metaphor of a pathfinding algorithm in a map with fog of war to describe intelligence. Humans, equipped with intelligence, can find paths where the map is incomplete or constantly changing. A perfectly static world would eliminate the need for intelligence, illustrating why intelligence’s adaptability is essential in an ever-evolving world.

## Conclusions

While current AI can mimic certain aspects of human skill through memorization, it lacks the core adaptable intelligence that characterizes human cognition. The challenge remains for AI to synthesize novel solutions and master new tasks intuitively and with little data, representing the ongoing quest toward achieving genuine artificial general intelligence. Understanding and learning from the subtleties of human intelligence will be essential steps on this path [[challenges_and_considerations_for_achieving_agi | Challenges and Considerations for Achieving AGI]].

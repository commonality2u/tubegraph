The **OGAS** project, conceived in the 1960s, was a grand vision for a single, nationwide computer network intended to autonomously gather and process data from all Soviet factories and command production as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This "[[concept_and_vision_of_the_soviet_internet_ogas | Soviet internet]]" was envisioned as the nervous system for the entire nation, aiming to usher in a new tech-led future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. However, this vision never fully materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Background: The Soviet Command Economy and Cybernetics

The Soviet Union operated a command economy where the state owned everything and economic activity was coordinated through directives, quotas, and commands, rather than free markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. While this system initially saw rapid growth and achievements, especially in military and aerospace, it struggled with central planning, leading to immense paperwork, distorted incentives, and frequent miscommunications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

Following Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev's leadership (1953-1964) introduced reforms, including the normalization and adoption of cybernetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Cybernetics, previously banned, was praised by Khrushchev as a major tool for creating a communist society, encouraging the development of computer science and industrial automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The Soviets saw computers as unlocking a universal method for problem-solving, potentially applicable to their ailing economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

The development of the U.S. SAGE air defense system, a groundbreaking computer network, greatly alarmed Soviet military planners in 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. In response, the Soviets developed their own centralized computer networks for air defense, missile defense, and space surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This military effort demonstrated the potential of networked computers for civilian use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Anatoli Kitov's Early Proposals

Anatoli Kitov, a pioneer in Soviet cybernetics, proposed the first effort to network the nation in 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. He advocated for computers to model and regulate the Soviet economy, replacing existing tabulating machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. In 1959, Kitov wrote to the Communist Party Central Committee, urging faster adoption of computers for economic planning and proposing a "Unified State Network of Computing Centers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. While his general proposals for computer adoption were supported, the network idea was initially rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

Buoyed by partial success, Kitov sent another letter in autumn 1959, proposing installing large computers at local factories and government agencies, linked together into "Automated Systems of Management" (ASUs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. He envisioned a future "Unified Automated Management System" (EASU) serving the entire nation, military and civilian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This system would use powerful military computers in underground centers, accessible via terminals for data input and processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Kitov saw it as a way to maximize the command economy's centralization advantages and achieve immense financial savings by replacing bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

However, Kitov's letter also criticized the Ministry of Defense for slow computer adoption and suggested sharing military technology with civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The military, unwilling to share its technology or engage in national economy tasks, reacted negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Kitov faced a show trial, losing his job, Communist Party membership, and military honors, effectively being "canceled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

### Glushkov's OGAS Vision

Despite Kitov's setback, others continued to develop the concept. Victor Glushkov, head of the Kiev Institute of Cybernetics, sought to create the ASUs Kitov had detailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. He even hired Kitov as a consultant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. In late 1962, Glushkov wrote to Khrushchev about the growing technology gap with the West, advocating for accelerated Soviet computerization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. In 1963, the Soviet leadership approved research into economic reform using automated computer networks (ASUs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

Glushkov's team successfully demonstrated computer control over distant factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Building on this, Glushkov envisioned **OGAS** (All-State Automated System for the Management of the Economy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

The original OGAS, conceived in the early 1960s, was ambitious, structured with three tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>:
1.  **Tier 1**: 20,000 computer terminals and ASUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
2.  **Tier 2**: 100-200 mid-level regional planning decision systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
3.  **Tier 3**: A central planner in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

Glushkov even proposed computerization of currencies and a moneyless system of receipts over the network, though he was advised to drop the latter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. The vision was for a single computer network to rationally and automatically plan, optimize, and produce the country's national economy as dictated by the Party Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. It aimed to be the Soviet counterpoint to the Western capitalist self-regulating market economy, using historical data for forecasts and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

## Obstacles to Implementation (Original Vision)

The single biggest reason this version of OGAS, presented in 1964, never developed as planned was cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>:
*   **Staggering Cost**: It would have taken 30 years and cost 160 billion rubles (about $1.4 trillion USD in 2016 dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. This was more than both the [[challenges_faced_in_soviet_space_program | Soviet space program]] and atomic bomb programs combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

Other significant challenges included:
*   **Technological Lag**: While Soviet military computers had world-leading capabilities, civilian computer technology lagged significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. The military was also unwilling to transfer its specialized technology to civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   **Bureaucratic Resistance**: Various players objected to being replaced or having their work dictated by a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Communist Party bureaucrats, Gosplan, industrial managers, and particularly the Central Statistical Administration, feared the loss of their power to control the flow of information if "objective" computer data was introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.
*   **All-or-Nothing Approach**: Glushkov's plans were "all or nothing," requiring a complete reformation of the country's management system, which was perceived as a revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

## Political Changes and Modified OGAS

In 1964, Khrushchev lost power, replaced by Leonid Brezhnev, who reversed many of his predecessor's economic reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. However, the directive for economic restructuring via computer remained on the agenda due to high-level backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Gosplan and the Central Statistical Administration rejected the project's utopian vision, seeking to control its resources for their own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. For OGAS to be implemented, it had to conform to the existing Soviet way of doing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

The widespread news of ARPANET going online in 1969 caught the Soviet leadership by surprise, helping to move the OGAS project forward due to competitive pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. With ARPANET in mind, Glushkov changed OGAS's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. This new iteration envisioned OGAS as a universal information bank, accumulating and moving information between national agencies, rather than controlling the entire economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. It would organize and control data flows, like a system of canals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

In a dramatic Politburo meeting on October 1, 1970, Glushkov presented his new OGAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. It seemed promising, with positive responses from some higher-ups and no objections from hardliners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. However, the Minister of Finance, Vasili Garbuzov, intervened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. Recognizing the immense political gravity of the project and its potential to erode his ministry's power, he dismissed OGAS and proposed a far more conservative counter-proposal, which won over the Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. Ultimately, the full OGAS proposal was neither fully accepted nor rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

## Outcome

Throughout the 1970s, several ASUs were built in individual factories, though estimates vary widely from around 100 to thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. However, networking them proved impossible because they were built haphazardly and without adherence to any standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. The nationwide united network of ASUs, as Glushkov envisioned, never happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

The proximate cause for the failure of the [[concept_and_vision_of_the_soviet_internet_ogas | Soviet internet]] was bureaucratic infighting, with various leaders and power centers objecting to its capabilities and hijacking the project for their own needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. However, the real reason was that Glushkov's vision fundamentally challenged how the Soviet Union ran things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. An invention cannot be separated from its place, and the Soviet system was just a couple of decades away from implosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

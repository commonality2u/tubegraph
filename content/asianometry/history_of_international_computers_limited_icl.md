From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

International Computers Limited (ICL) was established in 1968 through a "shotgun marriage" orchestrated by the British government, combining three computer manufacturers: British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM), Power-Samas, and English Electric. The government aimed for ICL to be the United Kingdom's national champion in computers, a direct competitor to IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite pioneering computing technology in the UK, ICL struggled against American and East Asian competition and was eventually sold to Fujitsu in 1990, eventually ceasing operations in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Origins in Punch Card Technology

The roots of ICL trace back to the electromechanical tabulating machine invented by American Hermann Hollerith in the 1880s for the 1890 U.S. census <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Hollerith's invention, which drew influences from cash registers and typewriters, revolutionized the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. He founded the Tabulating Machine Company of New York (TMC), which was later sold to Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), renamed International Business Machines (IBM) in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Punch card machines used punch cards for data input, output, and storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Initially for reading and summarizing data, by the 1920s, they performed basic mathematical operations like multiplication and division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. While useful for businesses, punch cards had limitations, including being prone to bending and having limited storage space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Fundamentally, these were calculating machines, not programmable computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM)

In 1907, Hollerith's British friends, R.P. Porter and Sir Raleigh Philpotts, founded the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) to license his technology for commercial and government use in the British Empire, excluding Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. BTM paid Hollerith an astonishing 25% of revenue in exchange for an exclusive license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This license was later inherited by IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. BTM's first automatic tabulator was available in 1908 and processed about 150 cards per minute, selling to large organizations like railways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

By the 1920s, BTM aligned with IBM against a major punch card competitor, Power-Samas, a French-American conglomerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Despite access to IBM's superior products, R&D, and manufacturing, BTM struggled to match IBM's sales prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. IBM dominated the US market with 90% share, but the British Empire market was evenly split between Power-Samas and BTM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. IBM executive Thomas Watson blamed BTM's "low-key and typically British" sales style, while BTM blamed the onerous 25% royalty rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

In the 1930s, both Power-Samas and BTM began designing their own machines, spurred by a "Buy British" movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. At the outbreak of World War II, BTM had around 1,200 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. During the war, both British punch card firms halted R&D for their products, turning facilities over to the UK government to produce precision military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## The Dawn of Electronic Computers

World War II accelerated the development of electronics and the stored-program computer, signaling the future of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Initially, computers were seen as expensive niche devices, costing over a million dollars and as large as a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Punch card companies like IBM, BTM, and Power-Samas were cautious, preferring an "evolution not revolution" approach to integrate electronics into their existing lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

IBM's first electronic calculator, the IBM 603 electronic multiplier, was announced in 1946 and sold hundreds of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. In 1948, the IBM 604 electronic calculating punch added limited programming capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The IBM 604 sold extremely well, with over 400 units still in use by 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### BTM's Breakup with IBM and New British Players

A significant event in 1949 was the mutual dissolution of the decades-long sales agreement between IBM and BTM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. While BTM lost access to IBM's products and R&D, it no longer paid the 25% royalty rate, which tripled its operating profit, allowing investment in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Despite IBM's significantly larger revenue, BTM aimed to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The original license, lasting half a century, kept IBM out of British territories for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

Concerned about the UK's ability to exploit its scientific innovations, the Labour government founded the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Lord Halsbury, NRDC's first general manager, foresaw that electronic data processing computers would soon be ubiquitous and that the existing British computing industry could not compete with American giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

Several British companies, seeing IBM's initial tepidness, ventured into the computing space:
*   **Ferranti**: Partnered with Manchester University to build a commercial computer, installing the Ferranti Mark One in February 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Elliott Brothers**: Produced a stored-program computer in 1947, and in 1953, became the second British firm to install a commercial computer, though low-powered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. They later focused on niche process computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **English Electric**: Expanded into computers, working with the National Physical Laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

These early efforts, while demonstrating [[technological_advancements_and_setbacks_in_the_british_computing_sector | British technological advancements]], were ultimately insufficient to compete with American companies like IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## The Rise of IBM and British Consolidation

In 1955, IBM introduced the IBM 650, the world's first mass-produced computer, which became very popular and was the first to make a profit in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. IBM's limited presence in the UK during the 1950s left a door open for domestic players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

BTM, despite its R&D capacity and having produced its own computer (Hollerith Electronic Computer - HEC One) with the University of London, showed little interest in general computing, with 90% of its revenue still coming from punch card machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

By the late 1950s, Power-Samas was struggling, leading BTM to acquire it in 1959, creating International Computers and Tabulators Limited (ICT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. This merger caused a "massive headache" for BTM management, as integrating Power-Samas's mechanically-minded R&D department lost years of progress needed for electronic computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

### The IBM 1401 and the "Software Crisis"

In 1959, IBM introduced the IBM 1401, a revolutionary computer that replaced vacuum tubes with transistors, making it cheaper, faster, and more reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. The 1401 also brought an ecosystem of enterprise hardware, peripherals, and software, targeting the core use case of the punch card industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. It sold over 10,000 units, becoming IBM's most important product by 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. The transistor-based 1401 obsoleted all first-generation vacuum tube computers, including those in Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

This led to further consolidation in the British industry. English Electric and ICT acquired the computing interests of companies that dropped out, including GEC (1961), EMI (1962), and Ferranti (1963) for ICT, and Leo Computers (1963) and Marconi (1964) for English Electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. By 1964, the British computing industry was largely just English Electric and ICT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. This wave of consolidation, however, led to "indigestion" due to incompatible engineers, techniques, and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

A new problem emerged with transistor technology: software costs began to grow, sometimes surpassing hardware costs, leading to what analysts called a "software crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. IBM addressed this by investing $500 million to develop the System/360, a range of computers with a single scalable architecture, allowing customers to upgrade hardware without rewriting software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. The System/360, considered the third generation of computer systems, surprised the entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

ICT responded by reworking the Ferranti-Packard 6000 into the ICT 1900 series, releasing it quickly to take advantage of IBM's production delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. English Electric licensed RCA's computer architecture, which was compatible with IBM System/360, leading to their System 4 series, announced in 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

## Government Intervention and the Birth of ICL

The British government, under Harold Wilson, became increasingly concerned about America's widening technology gap and the survival of the British computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. The Ministry of Technology (MinTech) was established in 1964, with the British computer industry as its top focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. Concerns were heightened by General Electric acquiring France's Bull and the US denying export licenses for computers to France, impacting the Concorde project and leading to France's failed "Plan Calcul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

MinTech sought to consolidate the industry by merging English Electric and ICT to create a national champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Initial merger talks in 1964 failed as both companies felt strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. However, after the Wilson government's re-election in 1966, they doggedly pursued the merger, offering a dowry of up to £30 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. By 1967, ICT was doing well, but English Electric found System 4's development costs onerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

Despite a reduced dowry of £13.5 million due to a worsening UK economy and devaluation of the pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>, the merger finalized in July 1968, creating ICL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. ICL generated £100 million in annual revenue, employed 34,000 people, and was the world's largest non-American computer manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

### Early Challenges and Strategic Missteps

ICL's mission was to rationalize its computer range, bulk up R&D, and compete with IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. It inherited two incompatible mainframe product families: the 1900 series from ICT and the System 4 from English Electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. ICL initially wanted to phase out the technically outdated 1900, but political pressure from the Labour government prevented it, as the System 4 was not "British made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

Political interference kept ICL focused as a mainframe manufacturer, which ironically hastened its marginalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. The over-emphasis on the expensive mainframe industry caused ICL to completely miss out on the minicomputer boom of the 1970s, a boom that would eventually impact IBM as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

## Recession, R&D Costs, and Japanese Collaboration

The 1968 computer industry recession led to General Electric and RCA exiting the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. ICL sought government intervention and aid, but the new conservative government under Edward Heath (elected 1970) initially adopted an anti-interventionist stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. However, after the rescue of Rolls-Royce in 1971, and with other European countries like France and Germany spending heavily on their computer industries, ICL did ultimately receive a £40 million loan from the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. This helped maintain R&D from 1972 to 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

It became clear that ICL could not afford the heavy R&D costs of staying competitive in the mainframe industry, which saw annual R&D spend rise by 50% from 1974 to 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. Two costs were particularly heavy:
1.  **Software**: Over a third of ICL's R&D budget was dedicated to writing new operating systems for each new architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.
2.  **Semiconductor Production Cycles**: The accelerating pace of semiconductor manufacturing technology meant product cycles shortened, which ICL struggled to keep up with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.

ICL's successful entry into the small business space with the 1976 acquisition of Singer Business Machines and its System 10 computers helped offset some costs, but the focus remained on the mainframe business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

To manage skyrocketing R&D, ICL sought a collaborator with strong technical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. Meanwhile, Fujitsu, a Japanese company, had partnered with Amdahl Corporation to release advanced computers that had technical parity with IBM's highest-end mainframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. By 1980, Fujitsu was one of IBM's few real competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. IBM responded by tightening its semiconductor production cycle, replacing its System/360 and 370 machines with the IBM-4300 series, offering a four-fold improvement in cost-performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.

ICL, caught in this crossfire, saw its technology lag behind IBM, estimating a nearly threefold increase in R&D spend to maintain competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. The 1980 economic recession further exacerbated ICL's problems, leading to projected £50 million losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. The Thatcher government, though initially loath to provide aid, agreed to a £200 million loan guarantee, conditional on a change in ICL's management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. ICL cut 10,000 jobs between 1980 and 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

ICL desperately sought a partnership for semiconductor technology. While American companies offered chips with 3,000 logic gates, Fujitsu offered 5,000 gates and a five-year roadmap for future chip designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. In 1981, ICL struck a technology transfer deal with Fujitsu, exchanging leading peripheral technologies (disks, tapes) for access to Fujitsu's more advanced semiconductor technology (8,000 gates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. This partnership led to the Series 39, released in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

## Demise and Lessons Learned

By 1984, ICL was taken over by British telecommunications firm Standard Telephone and Cables (STC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. With the mainframe market becoming a "dinosaur" after IBM released the home computer in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>, the 1981 rescue and Fujitsu partnership effectively ended ICL's hopes of being a national champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. ICL drastically cut R&D, focused on striking partnerships with outside vendors, closed manufacturing plants, and evolved into a simple assembler and distributor, focusing on sales and systems integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>.

In 1990, Fujitsu acquired ICL, a "minor shock to the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. Fujitsu promised to float the brand, but eventually shut it down in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.

The downfall of ICL highlights several [[challenges_faced_by_icl_in_competing_with_ibm | common trends and challenges]]:
*   **Lack of Technical Primacy**: The British industry consistently followed IBM and Japanese giants, failing to gain business leadership in its own geographic domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.
*   **Splintering of the Computer Industry**: The competitive intensity and sheer size of the market caused the industry to splinter, with individual companies emerging to focus on previously niche products like software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>. This raised the stakes, making it impossible for vertically integrated combines like ICL to keep up with specialized companies like Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>.
*   **Hollowness of National Prestige**: ICL and its political sponsors aimed to beat IBM in its strongest area—big, bulky mainframe computers—by mimicking IBM's strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>. However, ICL could never muster the same resources and ultimately faced the same market circumstances that led to IBM's decline in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

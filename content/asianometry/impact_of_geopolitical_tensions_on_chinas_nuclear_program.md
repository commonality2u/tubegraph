The People's Republic of China (PRC) detonated its first domestically produced atomic bomb on October 16, 1964, at 3 P.M. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> This event made China one of the five Atomic Powers, joining the United States, Soviet Union, and Great Britain. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> The development of [[chinas_first_nuclear_bomb_test | China's first nuclear bomb]] took less than five years, driven significantly by pressing geopolitical concerns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>

## Early Motivations and American Nuclear Blackmail

Even when the United States held a monopoly on atomic weapons, Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party leadership feared potential American nuclear intervention in the Chinese Civil War. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> When Mao visited Stalin in December 1949 to negotiate China's entry into the Soviet Bloc, he sought the assurance of a nuclear umbrella for his country. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a> The Soviets, having recently broken the Western monopoly, were reluctant to explicitly grant such protection. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance stated that in the event of an invasion, the other signatory would "render assistance," a clause Zhou Enlai insisted be expanded to "with all means at its disposal." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> However, nuclear weapons were never formally mentioned. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

These vague assurances were tested during the Korean War. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> As American forces approached the Yalu River, the border with China, Chinese leaders worried about an invasion and potential American use of the atomic bomb. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> Despite these fears, the leadership decided to intervene, believing the Americans would not risk all-out nuclear warfare with the Soviets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> Mao's gamble proved correct; the Americans did not use nuclear weapons, though they did threaten to. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>

After the Korean War, American threats of nuclear force continued to impact Chinese leadership, who termed it "nuclear blackmail." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> Statements by U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and General Curtis LeMay, who suggested dropping bombs in China, Manchuria, and Southeastern Russia, fueled these fears. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> During the First Taiwan Strait Crisis in late 1954 and 1955, U.S. military leadership recommended nuclear weapons use, though President Eisenhower refrained. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a> The U.S. also signed a mutual defense treaty with the Republic of China (Taiwan) in December 1954, which the Communists believed would embolden the KMT. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> While Mao Zedong likely would have pursued an atomic weapon anyway, this series of crises gave the program a special urgency. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>

## Sino-Soviet Cooperation and its Challenges

China initially turned to the Soviet Union, their largest trading partner and provider of industrial development and military equipment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a> Despite prior knowledge of the Soviet nuclear program, Stalin had been unwilling to transfer atomic technology, only offering a nuclear umbrella. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>

The situation changed after Stalin's death in 1953 and Nikita Khrushchev's rise to power. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> Khrushchev, seeking Chinese support to boost his domestic influence and de-Stalinize the Soviet Union, expressed a desire to help China develop its industry. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a> In October 1954, Mao directly asked Khrushchev for assistance with China's nuclear weapons program. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> Khrushchev was initially surprised and tried to dissuade China, emphasizing economic development and the existing nuclear umbrella. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> However, the Chinese insisted, leading to an agreement for cooperation on peaceful atomic energy use in April 1955. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> This [[sinosoviet_nuclear_cooperation_and_its_challenges | Sino-Soviet nuclear cooperation and its challenges]] included an experimental nuclear power plant, a cyclotron, Soviet nuclear experts, and assistance in exploring uranium reserves. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> In February 1956, cooperation expanded to include sending Chinese students to the Soviet Union and building nuclear research facilities in China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>

Despite this high point in relations, Mao viewed it as an "alliance of convenience," anticipating its eventual end and prompting China to maximize the transferred knowledge. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> China significantly increased science research funding and actively recruited talented Chinese scientists, including expatriates educated in the West, such as Dr. Chen Sha-sen. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a> [[chinese_scientists_contributions_to_nuclear_development | Chinese scientists' contributions to nuclear development]] were crucial, with individuals like Pong Hong-woo studying uranium fissioning in Paris and later directing China's Institute of Physics. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>

Up until 1957, Soviet transfers primarily focused on peaceful atomic energy, accelerating reactor design, though China already possessed significant knowledge from published Western literature. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> The Soviets resisted sharing direct nuclear weapons design or production knowledge. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>

## The Sino-Soviet Split and its Aftermath

A turning point came in late October 1956 with anti-communist protests in Hungary and Poland. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> Weakened, the Soviets needed the backing of their primary foreign ally, China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a> In 1957, against military advice, Khrushchev agreed to transfer atomic bomb technology to China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a> The October 1957 agreement included a "teaching model atomic bomb" with designs, documentation, and technology for processing uranium and plutonium. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>

Despite Khrushchev's later claims of giving "almost everything," Soviet scientists were instructed to limit disclosures. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> A key Soviet lecture in July 1958, covering bomb theory, structure, and assembly, provided only a basic blackboard sketch, no documents, parameters, or formulas, and was delivered mostly to administrative personnel. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a> Chinese scientists, including Dr. Chen Sun-chang, found the information mostly basic and already available from Western sources. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a> The subsequent Sino-Soviet split complicated the assessment of the actual [[role_of_soviet_technology_transfer_in_chinas_nuclear_development | Role of Soviet technology transfer in China's nuclear development]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>

Mao's perceived recklessness regarding nuclear war further strained relations. At the Moscow Conference in November 1957, Mao stated that even if half of mankind died in a nuclear war, the other half would remain, leading to global socialism. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a> These comments dismayed the Soviet leadership, causing them to renege on sending the teaching bomb prototype. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a> Delays and excuses continued until the transfer was postponed indefinitely, citing potential strain on relations with the West. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>

The Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958, where Mao initiated shelling of Jinmen and Matsu islands, further convinced Khrushchev that Mao was trying to provoke a global conflict. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a> In June 1959, Khrushchev terminated military cooperation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a> By July 1960, the last Soviet advisor had left China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a> Forty percent of promised equipment and raw materials never arrived, and only a minority of the 30 [[sinosoviet_nuclear_cooperation_and_its_challenges | Sino-Soviet nuclear industry projects]] were completed, forcing China to restart many endeavors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>

## China's Independent Path

The Soviet withdrawal was a significant blow but not entirely unexpected by some Chinese leaders who believed the Soviets intended to maintain a technical gap. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a> In January 1960, China launched the "596 project," named to commemorate the "shameful date" of Soviet aid withdrawal, signifying their determination to proceed independently. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a> Zhou Enlai declared China would achieve a breakthrough in three years and have a bomb stockpile in eight years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>

Despite economic and social pressures from the Great Leap Forward, China abandoned its dual-track approach (uranium-235 and plutonium) and focused solely on the uranium-235 design. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a> The Lanzo gaseous diffusion plant, critical for uranium enrichment, faced challenges after Soviet advisors left, including food shortages and politically motivated dismantling of equipment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a> However, by late 1961, the plant's machinery was successfully installed, and by mid-1963, uranium-235 was being isolated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>

Chinese scientists, working in Beijing suburbs, mastered the theory behind implosion designs by late 1962, and the final design for their implosion mechanism was ready a year later. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a> They were aided by "sloppy shredding" of critical papers by the departing Soviets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a> Unlike the [[comparison_between_british_and_other_countries_nuclear_programs | British nuclear weapons program]], which benefited from Los Alamos collaborations, China relied on theoretical knowledge and its own engineers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a> The enriched uranium arrived at the manufacturing plant in Subei in late 1963, and the 596 bomb was finally packaged. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>

The successful [[chinas_first_nuclear_bomb_test | Chinese nuclear test]] surprised both the Americans and Soviets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a> The U.S. had considered intervening to stop the program, and President Kennedy had even sounded out Khrushchev about military intervention, but these ideas were not pursued. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a> American intelligence was misled by China's choice of an implosion-type bomb using uranium, underestimating the capabilities of their gaseous diffusion plant. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>

China's indigenous nuclear program was a massive undertaking, involving hundreds of thousands of people and costing an estimated $4.1 billion (in 1957 prices), much of it incurred during the economically difficult Great Leap Forward. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a> While scholars debate the exact extent of Soviet benefit, Deng Xiaoping believed that if the Soviets had not broken the treaty, China wouldn't have built the bombs so fast. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a> The "sting and shame" of the abrogated treaty ultimately provided the Chinese with the "force of will" to complete the job. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>

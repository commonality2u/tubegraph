China is a significant market for x86 processor manufacturers. In 2020, Intel sold $20 billion worth of processors to China, and AMD sold $2.3 billion. Both figures are comparable to or higher than what these companies earn from the United States, highlighting China's massive market size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Recognizing this, China has shown interest in developing its own homegrown x86 processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Understanding x86 Processors

x86 refers to a family of instruction set architectures (ISA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. A chip design company takes an ISA, like x86 or [[the_significance_of_arm_and_riscv_in_chinas_semiconductor_industry | ARM]], and implements it to create a CPU micro-architecture, which can then lead to a family of chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Different companies can share instruction sets but still produce radically different designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. For example, Intel's and AMD's x86 implementations perform differently despite using the same instruction set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Similarly, Apple's self-developed [[the_significance_of_arm_and_riscv_in_chinas_semiconductor_industry | ARM]] chips differ in performance from others using the [[the_significance_of_arm_and_riscv_in_chinas_semiconductor_industry | ARM]] instruction set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Intel initially developed and popularized x86, but licensed it out to other companies for second-source and anti-competitive reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. AMD is the most well-known of these companies, holding a core license that was the subject of years of legal battles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. In contrast, [[the_significance_of_arm_and_riscv_in_chinas_semiconductor_industry | ARM]] the company licenses its IP to others, who then make and sell chips for devices like smartphones and IoT gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

As of today, most CPUs for PCs, game consoles, and servers are x86, known for handling compute-intensive tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. They power 481 of the world's top 500 computers and are seen as an American technology that has become a global standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Reasons for China's Domestic Ambition

China's desire for domestic alternatives to American technologies stems from several factors:
*   **Edward Snowden Revelations** The revelations regarding American spying on foreign allies and competitors raised alarm bells globally, leading countries to scrutinize the implementation of American technologies in critical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Increased Competition** The recognition of heightened competition between China and the United States has replaced the age of openness that followed the Sino-Soviet split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **National Champions** China aims to cultivate homegrown national champions in critical industries such as high-speed rail, solar, space, and now, computer chips, driven by national and patriotic pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **US Sanctions** The Trump administration's actions, such as cutting off Huawei from access to American technologies, reinforced China's fears and spurred on efforts for domestic solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Consequently, China seeks to have domestic x86 chips readily available to supply its massive user base, as a contingency for a "worst-case" scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Chinese Homegrown x86 Chip Lineages

There are two distinct lineages of homegrown x86 chips in the Chinese market: Zhaoxin and Haigong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Zhaoxin

Zhaoxin is the older of the two lineages and possibly holds better future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. It has been releasing CPUs since 2014, marketed as domestically made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Zhaoxin is a fabless semiconductor joint venture between the Shanghai municipal government and a Taiwanese company, Via Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Via Technologies, affiliated with Formosa Plastics, makes chipsets, motherboards, and CPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Via holds an x86 architectural license, acquired through its 1999 purchases of Cyrix and Centaur Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Via's acquisition of Centaur led to a prolonged patent battle with Intel, which concluded with a 10-year cross-license agreement in 2003, extended by a three-year grace period in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Zhaoxin architectures are now in their sixth generation and are direct descendants of Centaur Technologies' work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. The 2015 third-generation ZX-C (Zhangjiang) architecture is believed to be identical to Centaur's Isaiah 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Tests on the latest available Zhaoxin generation, the sixth-generation Lujiazui, indicate that their performance is roughly four to eight years behind the latest American designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. In terms of power usage, they consume less power than traditional desktop chips, likely reflecting their mobile and IoT origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Overall, these chips are considered sufficient for China's low-end needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

Zhaoxin, being a fabless company, has historically used [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]] for manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. For national security reasons, Zhaoxin has been attempting to switch from [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]] to a mainland alternative like [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | SMIC]], which is likely causing delays and performance loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Zhaoxin has also announced plans to enter the discrete GPU market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Haigong (AMD Joint Venture)

The second Chinese x86 joint venture initiative came at the behest of AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. In 2015, when AMD was financially struggling, it formed a joint venture to provide the Chinese market with a version of its Zen 1 x86 chips, intended to be considered "Chinese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The joint venture was structured to allow AMD to control its valuable IP while enabling the Chinese to claim the chips as homegrown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

This was achieved through a two-layer joint venture, collectively called Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co-Limited (THATIC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The Chinese partners included various private and public organizations, such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
1.  **Haiguang Microelectronics (HMC)**: A joint venture 51% owned by AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. AMD had majority control of HMC, with many workers being AMD employees, ensuring compliance with regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
2.  **Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit Design Company (Haigong)**: AMD owned only 30% of Haigong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

The technology transfer process was designed to navigate the requirements of various parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>:
*   AMD created IP for a special x86 server chip and transferred it to HMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   HMC removed certain sensitive elements from the chip and passed the remainder to Haigong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   Haigong made changes and updates, including designing the top-level architecture for the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   The chip was then returned to HMC and AMD for approval and finishing, before being sent to GlobalFoundries for fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   Finally, the chips were given to Haigong for packaging and sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

While AMD stated to the US government that the chips would be used strictly for commercial purposes, job postings and press interviews in China implied their use in new exa-scale supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. The complexity of this system, designed for PR headlines, also makes detecting inadvertent technology transfers difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Despite initial concerns from the Department of Defense, the Treasury Department ultimately agreed with AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This setup adhered to best practices for managing foreign technology joint ventures by keeping the most valuable parts away from the partner and transferring older technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

In 2019, THATIC was placed on an entity list, and AMD agreed not to enter into any more technology transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. AMD has since moved on, selling its fourth-generation Zen 3 chips, which are superior to the original IP held by THATIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The design would reportedly be difficult to reverse engineer or port to a non-US foundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Outlook and Broader Context

x86 still holds a strong position in the tech community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Intel's "Foundry 2.0" announcement, hinting at potentially opening up x86 IP to foundry customers, raises questions about whether Chinese fabless companies would be allowed to create x86 chips using Intel's services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Given the perceived value of x86 and the importance of technology transfer in national catch-up strategies for countries like China, Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, it's natural for Americans to view Chinese x86 chip development with some alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

However, x86 is not as dominant as it once was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. [[the_significance_of_arm_and_riscv_in_chinas_semiconductor_industry | ARM]] is gaining ground in areas previously dominated by x86, including desktops and servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Within China's indigenous [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | semiconductor efforts]], x86 development is a niche industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Any chips produced in this area are primarily for domestic consumption, likely not exportable due to litigation risks, and are not competitively priced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

For China, [[the_significance_of_arm_and_riscv_in_chinas_semiconductor_industry | ARM]] is the focus, with an estimated 95% of computer chips designed in China being [[the_significance_of_arm_and_riscv_in_chinas_semiconductor_industry | ARM]]-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. If not [[the_significance_of_arm_and_riscv_in_chinas_semiconductor_industry | ARM]], then [[the_significance_of_arm_and_riscv_in_chinas_semiconductor_industry | RISC-V]], the new open-source instruction set, is also a priority, backed by major players like Alibaba Cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

While Chinese x86 chips are interesting, they still lag many years behind their American-made competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Their impact is likely limited as long as Intel and AMD chips remain available on Chinese shelves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

ASML is a critical supplier of semiconductor [[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | lithography machinery]] for foundries such as Intel and [[TSMC's $28 billion capital expenditure | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These foundries rely on ASML's machines to produce chips, with TSMC's CEO noting that only 50 high-end [[ASML and highvolume EUV systems | EUV lithography machines]] can be made by ASML annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Without these machines, foundries cannot produce more 5nm chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Global Operations and Outsourcing Strategy

ASML is a global, sprawling company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Its primary factory is based in the Netherlands, with additional manufacturing and R&D sites in Connecticut and California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The company operates similarly to aerospace integrators like Boeing and Airbus, acting as a system integrator rather than manufacturing most parts in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. [[ASMLs global supplier network and outsourcing strategy | ASML's lithography machines]], such as the TWINSCAN variety, are built from independent modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Approximately 90% of the components for these modules are supplied by 500-600 external companies in ASML's outsourced supplier network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This approach differentiates ASML from competitors like Canon and Nikon, who tend to handle more production in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Of these suppliers, 300 are in the Netherlands, 100 in other parts of Europe (primarily Germany), and the rest largely in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. [[ASMLs partnerships and collaborations | ASML]] heavily relies on its suppliers for component expertise, similar to how TSMC relies on ASML for product training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. An example of a key partnership is with German company Carl Zeiss AG, a specialist in precision optics, which produces critical lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Reasons for Outsourcing

ASML prefers to remain in a system integrator role, leaving most manufacturing to its suppliers for several reasons:
*   **Specialization** ASML can acquire module components without needing to become world-leading in making every single part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. A single lithography stepper can incorporate over 1,600 individual components, with 200 being expensive or time-consuming to procure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Flexibility** Outsourcing allows ASML to adapt to changing technology trends, such as the shift to [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]], without the sunk cost of defunct in-house technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Economic Value** The system integrator role positions ASML at the pinnacle of the enterprise, dictating customer requirements and component integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This role generates the most economic value, and ASML often represents a significant portion (sometimes over 50%) of its suppliers' revenues, giving it strong influence over their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Many suppliers are too specialized to diversify away from ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

Occasionally, ASML may acquire a supplier to bring critical expertise in-house, such as Brion Technologies (computational lithography) and Cymer (lasers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Production and Delivery Process

The process begins with clients like Intel, Samsung, or TSMC planning future demand and ordering machines a year or more in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Clients choose from over 30 client-specific options, ensuring each machine is unique to their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

Once an order is placed, ASML's Supply Chain Planning Department creates a Master Production Schedule (MPS), detailing production timelines based on resource needs, workforce hours, component lead times, and customer deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Suppliers then receive purchase orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

The [[ASML lithography machine operation and precision | machines]] are built in modules, independently constructed in a process called "ASSY" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. These modules are then integrated during "FASY" (Final Assembly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. After FASY, the machine undergoes "Test" to ensure it meets internal benchmarks and performance is optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

Once approved, the machine is disassembled, packed, and shipped to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. With over 80% of customers in Asia, this often involves long flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. ASML technicians then collaborate with foundry technicians to install the device into a fab clean room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## After-Sales Support and Quality Control

ASML is responsible for the upkeep and service of its products, signing service contracts with uptime Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. These contracts can hold ASML financially liable for lost sales due to machine downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Consequently, ASML offers 24/7 support with trained technicians and staff from local technology development and training sites in numerous countries, including Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

For spare parts, ASML maintains local service warehouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. If a local warehouse lacks a part, the central warehouse aims to ship it within 14 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

[[ASMLs quality control and supply chain management | ASML maintains rigid quality control standards]] for its suppliers, adhering to a "zero defects" policy where each part is closely inspected and rejected if faulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The supply chain is complex, with planners accounting for rejections, disruptions, and transport issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Mission-critical part issues can halt production entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Some parts, like lenses and lasers, require significant lead times (a single lens can take up to 40 weeks to make), necessitating work to begin far in advance of customer orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## The Impact of EUV Lithography

[[ASML and the commercialization of EUV lithography | Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography]] is the most advanced lithography technology available today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Its commercialization, particularly with the TWINSCAN NXE series, is more cost-effective for sub-10nm nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. EUV technology, existing since the 1980s, is considered a revolutionary rather than evolutionary technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Its adoption required ASML's entire supply chain to be re-engineered from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

One key challenge for EUV is maintaining sufficient wafer etching speed while preventing yield defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Due to the low reflectivity (less than 70%) of EUV mirrors, a very powerful light source is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This is achieved by firing a CO2 laser at tin droplets to create plasma and ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The use of droplets minimizes tin debris, which could contaminate the mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This method evolved from earlier experiments with rotating cylinders, target tapes, spray jets, and liquid filaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

The tight margin of error for the power source has had consequences throughout the supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Traditionally, a pellicle (a 1 micrometer wide polymer film) is used in older lithography methods to prevent particle shadows on wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. However, even super-thin pellicles absorb and weaken EUV light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Therefore, earlier generations of EUV machines and their supply chains had to adhere to ultra-strict cleanliness standards, with a particle as small as 52 nm (the size of a small virus) capable of contaminating EUV components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This required installing new proprietary detectors at supplier premises and adding particle flushing steps throughout the build process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. These challenges were a major reason for EUV commercialization delays for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Pellicles are now available for EUV machines, which is expected to improve wafer yields and reduce cleaning requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

## Market Leadership

ASML's market leadership is defined by two factors:
*   **Technological Superiority** ASML products, though twice as expensive as those from Nikon or Canon, offer superior performance, printing in greater detail and at higher rates, which is what customers prioritize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Collaboration** ASML's strong record of collaboration with both customers and suppliers enables it to deliver highly demanding products, similar to an airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. This track record and continuous process improvement help ASML remain at the market's leading edge, contributing to the advancement of Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

[[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] serves as a crucial supplier of semiconductor lithography machinery to leading foundries such as Intel and TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The company's CEO has stated that they can produce only 50 high-end [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV lithography machines]] per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Without these specialized machines, foundries are unable to manufacture more 5nm chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Challenge of Production

Building more of these machines is immensely challenging due to the intricate process of coordinating thousands of suppliers that contribute parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Integrating all these components into a single, functional machine is extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This article delves into how [[asmls_rise_in the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] assembles its multi-million dollar lithography machines for multi-billion dollar semiconductor companies, highlighting the added complexity introduced by [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Global Operations and System Integration

[[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] is a global company with its main factory in the Netherlands, complemented by additional manufacturing and R&D sites in Connecticut and California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

The company's approach to manufacturing its lithography machines is akin to how Boeing and Airbus operate; [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] functions as a system integrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Its lithography machines, such as those of the [[overview_of_asml_lithography_machines | TWINSCAN variety]], are constructed from independent modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Approximately 90% of the components for these modules are produced by 500-600 external companies within [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]]'s outsourced [[supply_chain_management_of_asml | supplier network]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This reliance on an outsourced network differentiates [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] from its competitors, Canon and Nikon, which tend to keep more manufacturing in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Supplier Network Breakdown
*   **Netherlands**: 300 suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>
*   **Other Europe**: 100 suppliers, primarily in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   **United States**: Largely the remaining suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>

[[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] heavily relies on its suppliers for expertise in utilizing their components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. An example of this is their strategic alliance with the German company [[carl_zeisss_partnership_with_asml | Carl Zeiss AG]], a specialist in precision optics that helps produce critical lens components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Rationale for Outsourcing
While [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] occasionally acquires a supplier company to bring unique expertise in-house (e.g., Brion Technologies for computational lithography, and Cymer for lasers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, its primary goal is to maintain its role as a system integrator and outsource most manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
1.  **Specialization**: [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] can acquire specialized module components without needing to master the production of each part itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. A single lithography stepper can contain over 1,600 individual components, with 200 of them being expensive or time-consuming to procure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
2.  **Flexibility**: This model allows [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] to adapt to changing technology trends, such as the transition to [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV]], without incurring sunk costs from investments in now-defunct technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
3.  **Economic Value**: The system integrator role positions [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] at the apex of the enterprise, enabling it to define customer requirements and control component integration, which yields the most economic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Many suppliers are highly specialized and rely heavily on [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]], which can represent 50% or more of their revenues, granting [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] significant influence over their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Supply Chain Workflow

The [[supply_chain_management_of_asml | supply chain]] process begins with clients like Intel, Samsung, or TSMC, who plan their future product demand at least a year in advance and place orders for machines with specified delivery dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Each machine is customized from over 30 client-specific options, meaning no two [[overview_of_asml_lithography_machines | ASML machines]] are exactly alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

Once an order is confirmed, [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]]'s Supply Chain Planning Department creates a Master Production Schedule (MPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This MPS details production timelines, resource needs, workforce hours, component lead times, and customer deadlines, after which suppliers receive purchase orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Assembly and Delivery
[[overview_of_asml_lithography_machines | ASML machines]] are composed of independent modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>:
1.  **ASSY**: Modules are built independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
2.  **FASY (Final Assembly)**: Modules are integrated into the complete machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
3.  **Test**: The machine undergoes testing against internal benchmarks, with configurations adjusted to optimize performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

After meeting [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]]'s performance and reliability standards, the machine is disassembled, packed, and delivered to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Over 80% of [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]]'s customers are in Asia, often requiring long-distance transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Upon arrival, [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] technicians collaborate with foundry technicians to install the device into a fab clean room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Post-Sale Service and Support

[[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] is responsible for the upkeep and service of its products beyond delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. They sign service contracts with foundry customers that include uptime Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), making [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] financially liable for lost sales due to machine downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

To ensure continuous operation, [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] provides 24/7 support from trained technicians and staff located in local technology development and training sites across Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the United States, and 16 other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Spare parts are kept at local service warehouses, with critical parts from the central warehouse targeted for delivery within 14 days if a local warehouse lacks stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Quality Control and Challenges

[[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] enforces rigid "zero defects" quality control standards on its suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Each part is meticulously inspected, and any potential defect leads to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The [[supply_chain_management_of_asml | supply chain]] planners must account for rejected parts, disruptions, and transport issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. While minor issues can be worked around with "dummy parts," mission-critical component issues can halt production entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

Some parts, particularly the lens and lasers, require significant lead times, often longer than the final product's lead time; a single lens can take up to 40 weeks to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. The rising costs of the latest lithography equipment also contribute to the high cost of building new leading-edge fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV equipment]] can cost $150 million each, and individual components often exceed a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV Lithography]] Specifics

[[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography]] is the most advanced lithography technology available, with its commercialization through the [[overview_of_asml_lithography_machines | TWINSCAN NXE series]] expected to be more cost-effective for sub-10nm nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | EUV lithography]] necessitated a revolutionary re-engineering of semiconductor fabbing principles, requiring [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]]'s entire [[supply_chain_management_of_asml | supply chain]] to be reconfigured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

A key challenge for [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | EUV lithography]] is ensuring high wafer etching rates while minimizing defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. [[asmls_euv_light_source_and_laser_mechanics | EUV mirrors]] have low reflectivity (less than 70%), necessitating a powerful light source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This is achieved by firing a CO2 laser at tin droplets to create plasma and ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The use of droplets helps reduce tin debris and prevent contamination of the mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

The tight margin of error for the power source has had consequences across the [[supply_chain_management_of_asml | supply chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Traditional pellicles (polymer films) used in older lithography methods to prevent particle shadows absorb and weaken [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV light]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Until recently, when pellicles became available for [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV machines]], earlier generations required ultra-strict cleanliness standards throughout the entire [[supply_chain_management_of_asml | supply chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. A particle as small as 52 nm (the size of a small virus) could contaminate an [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV supply]] component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Maintaining such cleanliness pushed the limits of technical possibility, requiring new proprietary detectors at supplier premises and particle flushing steps throughout the build process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. These challenges were a major reason for the decades-long delay in [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV commercialization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

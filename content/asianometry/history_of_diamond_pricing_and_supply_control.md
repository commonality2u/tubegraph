From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Diamond prices have famously had little to no relation to their extraction cost, with jewelry shop diamonds costing around $550 per carat and high-class diamonds up to $20,000 per carat, despite mining costs being stable at $58-60 per carat for 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This inflated pricing is due to various supply cartels throughout history that carefully manage supply to maintain steady prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Early Attempts at Market Control

The overpricing of diamonds is not a recent phenomenon, with market entities attempting to control supply and manipulate prices upwards for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Even in antiquity, when Indian kings dominated diamond production, prices far exceeded extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. For example, in the 1500s, a half-carat diamond cost the equivalent of 30,000 days of an average laborer's wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

In 1725, the discovery of diamonds in Brazil led to a market flood, causing prices to plummet by 30 to 50 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The Portuguese Crown quickly intervened, taking control of all mines and limiting supply to stabilize prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## The Rise of De Beers

The most famous supply cartel, [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]], emerged after the discovery of the 21.8 carat Eureka diamond in South Africa in 1866 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This discovery led to a mining rush, with production soaring from 100,000 carats in 1870 to 3 million carats in 1880 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Cecil Rhodes and Consolidation
Amidst this boom, Cecil Rhodes founded the [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]] Mining Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Rhodes managed his company efficiently, mining diamonds more effectively than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. He also significantly reduced labor costs by strictly cracking down on theft and housing migrant workers in closed compounds, providing food and clothes at cost, and controlling drunkenness and brawling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This "investment in labor" reduced labor costs from 36% in 1883 to just over 26% in 1887 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This financial strength allowed [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]] to buy out competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. By 1888, Rhodes and [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]] consolidated the South African diamond mining industry and imposed production limits to stabilize prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### The Central Selling Organization (CSO)
After Rhodes's death, Ernst Oppenheimer, founder of Anglo American, took over as chairman of [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Under his leadership, the company established agreements with other diamond producers to sell all their raw production to the Central Selling Organization (CSO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The CSO bought diamonds at a fixed, profit-guaranteed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. It then resold the diamonds in 10 sales events, called "sites," to jewelry cutting factories known as "site holders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

At these sites, site holders would inform the CSO of their stone needs, and the CSO would attempt to fulfill the request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Site holders were escorted to a room, presented with a box of diamonds, and were not allowed to negotiate the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. They had to take the whole box, pay the full price, and could not resell any of the rough diamonds on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Those who did not follow these rules were excluded from the cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Marketing and "A Diamond Is Forever"
The CSO also took over the industry's marketing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In 1938, Harry Oppenheimer, Ernest's son, collaborated with N.W. Ayer of New York to create a marketing campaign linking diamonds with romance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This campaign used influencer and content marketing, along with smart advertising, to build the diamond brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Movie stars wore diamonds, news articles were planted about celebrities acquiring fine diamonds akin to fine art, and the famous 1949 slogan "A diamond is forever" was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This campaign was incredibly successful, making diamonds the pinnacle of luxury and a fixture at weddings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]] Faces New Challenges

For centuries, people had desired to make their own diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Early attempts to create synthetic diamonds in the late 1800s, by scientists like James Hannay and Ferdinand Frederick Henry Moissan, were unsuccessful, mainly due to the technological limitations of their era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. It wasn't until 1915 that Gilbert Lewis and Merle Randall made a breakthrough, showing that at 10,000 atmospheres, diamond and graphite were in equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This led to a roadmap for diamond synthesis: achieving 2,000 degrees Celsius and over a million pounds per square inch of pressure, potentially less with a metal catalyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

In February 1953, General Swedish Electrical Limited Company (ASEA) produced the first [[technological_advancements_in_diamond_synthesis_methods|synthetic diamond]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. They achieved this by applying 80,000 bar (1.2 million pounds per square inch) and 2,000 degrees Celsius to graphite with an iron solvent, resulting in small diamond crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. However, ASEA did not immediately publicize or patent their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

General Electric (GE), a major diamond consumer for industrial grit, formed a group in 1951 to produce [[technological_advancements_in_diamond_synthesis_methods|synthetic diamonds]] due to supply chain concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. By modifying a design from Nobel laureate P.W. Bridgman, GE created a "belt apparatus" capable of exerting three million pounds per square inch at 3,400 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. At these extreme conditions, graphite directly transitioned into diamond without a solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Initial Impact of Synthetic Diamonds on De Beers
News of GE's [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds_and_their_impact_on_the_market|synthetic diamond]] success temporarily threatened consumers' beliefs in the uniqueness of natural gemstones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. However, these initial synthetic diamonds were very small (about one millimeter wide), posing no threat to [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]], which dealt in larger stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Later, researchers found that by using a seed diamond and strict control of heat and pressure, they could grow diamonds up to three carats, but these were dark, low-quality, and better suited for industrial grit than jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]] could breathe a sigh of relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### Other Challenges to De Beers' Control
Throughout the 1950s and 60s, [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]] faced challenges in maintaining cartel control amidst revolutionary politics in Africa and new diamond discoveries in Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Despite mining only 25-40% of the supply itself, [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]] maintained its market power by marketing and selling 80% of global output, even reaching a semi-secret agreement with the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### The Rise of Gem-Quality Synthetics
It wasn't until 1970 that scientists could create a large, gem-quality [[comparison_of_synthetic_and_natural_diamonds_in_the_jewelry_industry|synthetic diamond]] crystal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The key was a long growth time, taking about a week to grow a one-carat diamond, as attempts to speed up the process caused flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This long process made it economically infeasible, and the resulting crystals were often yellow and easily distinguishable from natural diamonds using UV fluorescence or absorption spectroscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

Researchers began exploring low-pressure methods, like chemical vapor deposition (CVD), to grow diamonds without expensive high-pressure equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. From 1952-1953, William Eversole of Union Carbide experimented with heating carbon-containing gas in the presence of a seed diamond, allowing carbon atoms to attach and grow the diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This method is heavily used in the [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics|semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

Eversole's work was largely forgotten until 1963 when Dr. John Angus of Case Western Reserve University replicated and continued it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The key to successfully growing pure gem-quality diamonds with CVD was atomic hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Atomic hydrogen helped suppress graphite formation and turned formed graphite into gas, carrying it away from the diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. In the 1980s, a Japanese team further accelerated growth using hot filaments or microwaves to activate hydrogen and methane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

By the 1990s, the CVD industry could make single-crystal [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds_and_their_impact_on_the_market|synthetic diamonds]] in various colors, and these gem-quality synthetics began appearing in the jewelry market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]] responded by investing in new detection methods like UV fluorescence, X-rays, and advanced spectroscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. However, synthetics rapidly eliminated these weaknesses, reaching a point where identification is only possible in a lab with very advanced tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

## The Shifting Diamond Market

This technical improvement in synthetics coincided with massive changes in the diamond industry during the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. While Japan's rise as a luxury jewelry market in the late 1980s boosted the industry, the fall of the Soviet Union and new deposits in Australia introduced new competitors, breaking the old cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

After the Soviet collapse, former [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]] customer Lev Leviev built one of the first truly independent competitors by purchasing diamond factories and striking agreements with the new Russian monopoly, Alrosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. The Australian mining giant BHP, possessing the Argyle mine, also stayed out of the cartel, taking market share from [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

By the turn of the century, [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]] had to acknowledge it no longer controlled the entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. In 2000, [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]] restructured into a more traditional luxury company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. They shifted marketing to promote [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]]-affiliated dealers and partnered with Louis Vuitton to open branded retail ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

### De Beers Embraces Synthetics
In 2020, [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]] announced it would begin producing and selling its own [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds_and_their_impact_on_the_market|synthetics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This move aims to leverage the [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds_and_their_impact_on_the_market|synthetic diamond]] industry's [[technological_advancements_in_diamond_synthesis_methods|technological advances]] and benefit from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

This market transition is likened to the shift in the pearl industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Pearls were once natural gems, but in the 1910s, Japan pioneered cultured pearl farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Consumers preferred these [[comparison_of_synthetic_and_natural_diamonds_in_the_jewelry_industry|synthetic pearls]] due to their rounder, better appearance and environmental friendliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. After a difficult market transition in the 1920s, virtually every pearl found in jewelry shops today is cultured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

Similarly, modern gem-quality CVD [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds_and_their_impact_on_the_market|synthetic diamonds]] are becoming more beautiful, aesthetically ideal, better for the environment, produced with less exploited labor, and far cheaper than natural diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. In a way, [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds_and_their_impact_on_the_market|synthetic diamonds]] are breaking the diamond market, but not necessarily by making diamonds cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Where previously consumers paid a premium for the stone's scarcity, they now pay for the scarcity of the [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control|De Beers]] luxury brand, similar to how one might pay for a Louis Vuitton item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The notion that America is attempting to "steal" TSMC or force technology transfer from Taiwan has become a growing talking point in Taiwan, particularly following local elections and the anticipated 2024 startup of TSMC's Arizona facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This concern stems from recent developments that appear to shift away from TSMC's long-standing norm of keeping its most advanced operations primarily in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## TSMC's Arizona Expansion

TSMC has been developing a new production facility in Arizona since its announcement in May 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Initially, the plan was to produce N5 chips, which are highly advanced and represent the most advanced node TSMC has ever attempted to bring outside Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

However, further announcements were made in December 2022:
*   **N4 Process Upgrade:** TSMC committed to bringing its N4 process, an upgrade on the N5 line, to Arizona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Second Arizona Factory:** An additional investment of $28 billion over three years is planned for a second Arizona factory, which will be equipped with N3 process technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The N3 process is expected to enter high-volume production by 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Despite these expansions, TSMC remains committed to maintaining its most advanced nodes in Taiwan, with plans for [[tsmc_n2_process_node_and_new_fabs | N2]] and N1 fabs expected to be in production by 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Other International Expansions
TSMC is also expanding to other countries, including:
*   A specialty n28 plant in the Kumamoto prefecture, Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   Discussions for a plant in Germany are ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Drivers for US Expansion

The push for TSMC's expansion in the US is driven by a confluence of demand and financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Customer Demand
Apple, TSMC's largest customer, accounts for approximately 25% of TSMC's total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Apple has publicly stated its decision to source chips from the Arizona plant starting in 2024, and potentially from Europe in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. TSMC's rise is linked to Apple's decision to shift chip production from Samsung to TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Therefore, TSMC has an interest in meeting customer demand to prevent clients like Apple from reverting to [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | competitors]] such as Samsung or Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### US Subsidies and Competition
The US CHIPS Act of 2022 allocated $50 billion in subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. These subsidies incentivize large-scale build-outs, with competitors like Samsung investing $17 billion in Taylor, Texas, and Intel investing $20 billion in Columbus, Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Strategically, TSMC benefits by accepting these subsidies, which reduces the funds available for its [[competition_between_tsmc_and_samsung | competitors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Rebutting Technology Transfer Claims

The claim that the US is trying to force a technology transfer from TSMC to an American company appears unsubstantiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **No Joint Ventures:** Typical technology transfer scenarios involve joint ventures where a foreign company partners with an indigenous one, with specific requirements for indigenous product content and knowledge transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. TSMC's Arizona facilities, like most of its fabs, are wholly owned by TSMC, not joint ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Executive Risk:** The risk of high-level executives leaving to start new companies, as seen in past technology transfers, is inherent to the industry and not specifically exacerbated by an Arizona fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Scale Comparison: US vs. Taiwan

Claims of America "stealing" a significant portion of Taiwan's manufacturing, resulting in "massive loss" to the Taiwanese economy, are not supported by the scale of investment and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Capital Expenditure
TSMC's capital expenditure for 2022 was about $36 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The $28 billion investment in the second Arizona fab, spread over three years until 2026, amounts to approximately $9 billion per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This represents 25% to 30% of the proposed annual capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, meaning the majority of TSMC's spending remains in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Wafer Shipments
In 2021, TSMC produced and shipped 14.2 million 300-millimeter equivalent wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. By 2024, the initial Arizona factory will produce around 20,000 wafers per month, which is less than 1/50th of TSMC's current annual production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Even with planned expansion to 50,000 wafers per month by 2026, it would still not be enough to constitute a major shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Continued Investment in Taiwan
TSMC is juggling at least five other build-outs in Taiwan, including:
*   New phases to existing Taiwanese fabs, such as expansions in Tainan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   New [[tsmc_n2_process_node_and_new_fabs | N2]] plants in Baoshan and potentially Taichung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   Future plans for an N1 plant in the Longtan District of Southern Taoyuan City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   A Kaochiong Fab, which is moving ahead with n28 build-out, with construction officially starting in November 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Broader Semiconductor Supply Chain

The assumption that the Arizona Fab makes America self-sufficient in silicon is problematic because it overlooks the broader semiconductor supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Chip Types
The Arizona Fab will produce leading-edge N4 and N3 chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. However, the majority of the world's industrially important semiconductors—those found in fridges, airplanes, and cars—are not leading-edge chips but rather older nodes like 130nm, 65nm, and n28 chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. These high-volume, low-price chips constitute the majority of TSMC's volume, but a minority of its revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

### Other Taiwanese Foundries
Taiwan is home to other significant semiconductor foundries beyond TSMC, including:
*   UMC (number three largest foundry globally) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   Powerchip (seventh) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   Vanguard (eighth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
These companies possess specialty processes that few others have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Packaging, Assembly, and Testing (OSAT)
Taiwan holds leading positions in the rest of the chip supply chain, particularly in wafers, packaging, assembly, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The US's position in global packaging, assembly, and test capacity is notably low, at 3% market share compared to 10% in fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. While America might have a chance in advanced packaging for high-performance computing, there is no Arizona Fab or government funding for conventional packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

Taiwan has three of the world's five largest outsourced semiconductor packaging, assembly, and testing (OSAT) companies:
*   ASE Group (the largest) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   SPIL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   Powertech Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### Human Capital
The core of TSMC's operations, including thousands of difficult-to-replace R&D, operations, and supply chain management personnel, are located in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. The success of the fabs relies heavily on these managers and experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## Conclusion

The idea that America is "stealing" TSMC is largely a misperception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Taiwan remains TSMC's greatest asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, and the company has no choice but to remain heavily invested in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Billions of dollars and 50 years of industrial development have made Taiwan a leader not just in semiconductor manufacturing, but also in electronics assembly and specialty plastics—a position that cannot be replicated quickly or easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

The China-Taiwan scenario poses a systemic risk beyond individual companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, and its wider repercussions cannot be easily hedged against for the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

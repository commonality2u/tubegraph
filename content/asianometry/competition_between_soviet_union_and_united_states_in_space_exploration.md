From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The period from 1960 to 1973 saw the Soviet Union launch 15 probes and orbiters to Mars, driven by intense [[historical_space_race_between_us_and_ussr | competition]] with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Despite their efforts, the Soviets struggled to match NASA's successful Martian program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. They lost the race to fly by Mars, orbit Mars, and safely land on and photograph the Martian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. While the Soviets achieved success with Venus, they ultimately lost the Mars race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This article focuses on the [[soviet_mars_missions_from_1960_to_1973 | Soviet missions to Mars]] within the context of this rivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Origins of the Space Race

In 1950, Joseph Stalin sought a missile capable of striking Western enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. He tasked Sergey Korolev, who had transitioned from gliders to rockets, with reverse-engineering German V2 rocket designs from the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Korolev eventually developed the R7 missile, which was first successfully fired in 1957, after Stalin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Stalin's passing also led to a political climate that allowed Korolev to pursue his dream of space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. He famously told his engineers that the rocket's purpose was to "get there," pointing to the Moon, Venus, and Mars, emphasizing it was "not some military toy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

In January 1956, after significant lobbying, the Politburo approved the development of an artificial satellite, Object D, later known as Sputnik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Despite three failed launches, Sputnik 1 was successfully placed into orbit on October 4, 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The Soviet Union underestimated the global impact of their satellite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. While Soviet media reported on their space progress, few in the West believed it until Sputnik was in orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The New York Times used headline font sizes not seen since Pearl Harbor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, causing American political elites to ponder their failure and seek to catch up, while Soviet elites celebrated their unexpected success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

Capitalizing on this, Korolev and his team proposed an expedition to the Moon in January 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. By July 1958, this expanded into a vast new program:
*   Sending robot spacecraft to Mars and Venus, upgrading the R7 to a three-stage rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   Developing a four-stage R7 rocket for manned missions to the Moon, Venus, and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Establishing colonies on these planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

Initially, the Soviet space program focused resources on lunar probes in 1958 and 1959, but their true targets were the planets, with Mars as the "real prize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. They aimed to leverage the orbital window to Mars that occurs roughly every 25 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Early Mars Missions and Challenges (1960s)

The first orbital window to Mars, originally set for 1958, slipped to 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Interplanetary travel demanded higher speeds (11 km/s compared to 7 km/s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, necessitating additional stages for the R7 rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Political Pressure and Technical Hurdles

The [[historical_space_race_between_us_and_ussr | space race]] introduced a significant political dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. In January 1960, Nikita Khrushchev expressed concern about the growing American space program and demanded a launch to Mars and Venus within the 1960 window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This led Korolev to rapidly develop Project 1M for Mars, scheduled for September 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

The two 1M spacecraft, weighing 640 kg, were to be launched by a new, more powerful four-stage R7 rocket, the 8K78 or "Molnia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. However, in February 1960, this rocket existed only on paper, and Korolev's team had to build the fourth stage from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The rush to meet the deadline led to manufacturing errors, with factories producing faulty components and probes arriving in pieces, requiring extensive repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

On the ideal launch date of September 27, the lander's radio system failed ground tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Instruments for ultraviolet spectrography, television, and infrared spectrometry had to be removed due to integration issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Early Failures

The first Molnia rocket, launched October 10, 1960, broke up over Eastern Siberia due to heavy vibrations during the second stage burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The second probe also failed, as the third stage of the rocket did not trigger, causing it to break up in the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. These 1M launches failed before their newly built fourth stages could even be tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Nedoelin Catastrophe
> A few weeks after these Mars mission failures, a prototype launch for an R-16 missile went disastrously wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. A short circuit caused the second stage engines to fire prematurely, detonating the first stage tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The explosion incinerated numerous technicians, and the missile's designer, M.I. Nedelin, was killed, with only his melted golden star and wristwatch found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

In February 1961, Korolev's team launched two Venus probes (1Vs) similar to the 1M probes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The second, named Venera 1, successfully entered Venus's orbit, becoming humanity's first true interplanetary spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This success provided little respite for Korolev, who immediately plunged into the 2MV project for Venus and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

The Molnia rocket continued to be unreliable due to manufacturing issues in its lower stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. A critical challenge was launching the fourth stage in zero gravity while orbiting Earth, as engineers struggled to force free-floating fuel particles into tanks for ignition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Cuban Missile Crisis Impact (1962)

The Soviet program built six 2MV probes, three for the 1962 Mars launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. These probes, weighing 900 kg, carried large cameras and instruments for detecting life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

The first 2MV series probe, 2MV-4 No. 1 (Sputnik 22), launched on October 24, 1962, during the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Korolev's Deputy, Boris Chertok, recounts being told to remove the spacecraft from the pad at Baikonur Spaceport to make way for an ICBM due to a "National Emergency Crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Baikonur had only two launch pads, requiring military and civilian rockets to share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Despite the geopolitical tension, the Mars probe eventually launched but failed in Earth orbit due to an issue with the fourth stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

Mars 1 (originally 2MV No. 4 or Sputnik 23) was launched on November 1, 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. While it initially separated and unfurled solar panels, a gas engine leak in the orientation system led to a loss of contact on March 21, 1963, a few months before its arrival at Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Despite this, it was named Mars 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### Mariner 4's Success and Shifting Priorities

Troubled by the 2MV series' engineering failures, the Soviets introduced the Zond series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. However, these probes also experienced problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. In November 1964, Zond 2, intended for Mars, suffered fatal onboard failures, including a solar panel failing to unfurl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

This failure was exacerbated by the news that the Americans had reached Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Mariner 4, launched around the same time as Zond 2, successfully flew by Mars in July 1965, sending back 22 photographs covering 1% of the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. The images revealed a cold, dead world, similar to the Moon, with no canals, no magnetic field, and a very thin atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This discovery significantly downgraded dreams of sophisticated Martian life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

By this point, the Soviets recognized the seriousness of the American goal to land a man on the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. In August 1964, the Politburo directed Korolev to pursue the same, initiating direct [[historical_space_race_between_us_and_ussr | competition]] for a lunar landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. This "race to the moon" disrupted the Soviet space program's plans, leading to managerial chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

Korolev's primary focus became sending a man to the Moon, diminishing his capacity for robotic planetary missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. In March 1965, Mars missions were reassigned to a new firm, Lavochkin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Korolev passed away less than a year later, in January 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

## Revamping the Mars Program (Late 1960s)

Mariner 4's success fundamentally changed the Soviet approach to Mars missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The Lavochkin team concluded that the first generation of Mars craft had fundamental flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. They decided against simply replicating Mariner 4; instead, they aimed to surpass the Americans by soft-landing a probe on Mars and searching for microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. In October 1965, the Soviet program leadership decided to reboot the entire Mars program, meaning they would miss the 1967 launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

The new project, M69, needed to be launched by 1969 to precede American missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. The M69 probes abandoned the old 3MV Zond designs because Mariner 4 showed the Martian atmosphere was too thin for previous Lander designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. The program received a boost from the new UR-500 or "Proton" rocket, originally a super-large ICBM, capable of sending 4-5 metric tons on an interplanetary trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

The M69 plan originally envisioned a Mars Orbiter and Lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. Due to time constraints, engineers initially tried adapting a lunar design but faced fundamental issues with the propulsion system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. In February 1968, Georgi Babakin, head of Mars team engineering, made the risky decision to scrap the current design and restart, just 13 months before launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

The new design featured a spherical tank, an engine, a large antenna, solar panels, and instrumentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Mars 69 carried three color cameras and was the first Soviet planetary device with an onboard computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. An entry probe and Lander were initially planned but removed due to weight and landing test issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. The new design's weight ballooned to 4850 kg, mostly fuel, due to a lack of advanced semiconductor technology needed to shrink instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

The mission plan involved a highly complex launch sequence: a three-stage Proton rocket would take the probes into Earth orbit, a fourth stage would fire for interplanetary injection, and then the M69 probe would use its own engine for further adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. This sequence had never been attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

### [[impact_of_political_pressure_on_soviet_space_missions | Political Pressure]] and Continued Failures

The Lavochkin team operated under immense stress due to the Communist Party's insistence on meeting the 1969 launch date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. A special military-industrial resolution was issued to ensure compliance, with weekly updates demanded by the Central Committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. Underperforming suppliers and individuals were blacklisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. Teams worked around the clock, with folding beds installed in offices and cafeterias open 24/7, providing free meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Despite the "Blood, Sweat, and Tears" of these workers, they received no overtime pay, working out of "enthusiasm for the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

> [!WARNING] M69 Failures
> Tragically, this immense effort was in vain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.
> *   The first M69 probe (M69a), launched March 27, 1969, exploded 438 seconds into launch due to a rotor failure in the rocket's third stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.
> *   The second probe (M69b), launched April 2, 1969, also failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. Its first stage engine failed at launch, tilting the rocket, which fell back to the ground and exploded, contaminating the launch pad with toxic materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>.

The failures of the Proton Rocket, attributed to the "mass of political pressure," demonstrated "exactly the wrong way to run a space program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. This defeat was compounded by the American triumph of Apollo 11's Moon landing in July 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>, followed by Mariner 6 and 7 missions, which flew over Mars, took hundreds of photos, and studied its atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

## The 1971 Mars Window: A High-Stakes Bet

Disappointed, the Soviet program turned to the 1971 Mars launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. M69's failure meant engineers lacked the atmospheric data necessary for a soft landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. 1971 was a "special year" due to Mars and Earth being particularly close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

Managers chose a daring strategy:
1.  **M71S (Orbiter):** Launched first, carrying 800 kg more fuel to reach Mars quickly and gather crucial atmospheric data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.
2.  **M71P (Lander) x 2:** Arrive later, using the M71S data to calculate entry trajectories for soft landings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

Soft landing in the thin Martian atmosphere onto unknown terrain was the hardest part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. The Americans, designing Viking, chose a controlled gliding entry due to their detailed atmospheric knowledge from previous missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. The Soviets, lacking this data and with the Americans not sharing, had to attempt an "uncontrolled ballistic entry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. This meant trajectories were solely determined by gravity, atmospheric drag, and initial entry conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

The plan was to release the entry probe 46,000 km above Mars, fire engines to assume a 120-degree entry angle, and deploy a parachute as high as possible (35 km) while traveling at Mach 3.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. The sequence relied on timers, with a radio altimeter monitoring distance, soft landing engines firing at 200 seconds, and small rockets pushing the parachute and entry probe bits away from the landing site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>.

To test the parachute, probe models were dropped from balloons and rockets, accelerating to Mach 3.5 with gunpowder engines for parachute deployment tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. Lander models were also catapulted onto simulated Martian ground at 30 mph to ensure survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. The Landers would open like an "Alien" egg, exposing instruments to take measurements and snap pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. They even built a small "Prop-M Marsokhodnik" rover, about 10x10 inches, that "walked" on skis to measure ground density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.

### The 1971 Missions: Further Setbacks

The Soviets were under renewed [[impact_of_political_pressure_on_soviet_space_missions | political pressure]] as the Americans planned to send Mariner 8 and 9 to Mars in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. They engineered the M71S Orbiter to reach Mars first for a propaganda win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The Fateful Typo
> While American Mariner 8 failed on May 8, 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>, the Soviet M71S launch on May 9 also went wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>. An operator made a "gross and unforgivable mistake" by coding the fourth stage to fire at 150 hours instead of 1.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. The rocket remained in Earth orbit for two days before crashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

This loss meant the Soviets lacked atmospheric data for the M71P landers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. Meanwhile, the American Mariner 9, launched May 30, 1971, took a faster trajectory and became the first Orbiter around Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.

Despite the setback, the two M71P missions (Mars 2 and 3) launched successfully on May 19 and 21, 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.
*   **Mars 2** arrived on November 27, 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>. The landing was attempted, but due to incorrect data interpretation by its programs, the entry probe entered the atmosphere at the wrong angle and hit the ground before the parachute deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. It remains the first Earth-made object to reach the Mars surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
*   **Mars 3** arrived on December 2, 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>. This time, the optical navigation system worked, and the landing sequence (parachute, Lander drop) went as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. The Lander settled on December 2, 1971, amidst a violent Mars storm, and began transmitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. However, just 14.5 seconds after starting, the television camera system failed, sending only 79 lines of a single photograph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>.

The exact reason for Mars 3's failure is uncertain, though theories include electric discharges from dust during the storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. This image remained secret until the late 1980s, meaning the first good image of the Martian surface wasn't available until the Viking missions in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>.

While the entry probes failed, Mars 2 and 3 continued to orbit Mars for several months, conducting scientific research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. Their findings were overshadowed by Mariner 9's stunning success, which took 7,329 high-quality photographs covering 85% of the Martian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

## Détente and the 1973 "All-Out Assault"

During this period, the Cold War was in a state of Détente <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. Leaders Nixon and Brezhnev struck deals for joint missions in sciences, including planetary exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. As part of these agreements, the Soviets and Americans agreed on a data swap: the Soviets would provide data from their Mars 2, Mars 3, and Venera 8 missions, and the Americans would share the atmospheric data the Soviets lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.

Despite this collaboration, the [[historical_space_race_between_us_and_ussr | competition]] persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>. Knowing Viking was launching in 1975, Soviet leadership planned an "all-out assault" on Mars in the 1973 launch window to try and beat the Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.

The plan expanded from two Orbiter-Lander craft to two orbiters (Mars 4 and 5) and two flyby-landers (Mars 6 and 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>. These adopted similar designs to the M71 devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

### The Transistor Flaw

All four spacecraft launched without incident in summer 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. However, engineers knew of a critical flaw: repeated failures in the power systems due to fundamental faults in the 2T312 transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. These transistors, fabricated at a rural site, were supposed to have gold leads but had them swapped for aluminum ones, causing corrosion and high failure rates after 1.5 years of production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. Engineers estimated a 50/50 chance of catastrophic failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. The ministry chose to proceed, as delaying would have been a political embarrassment, and 1973 might be their last chance before Viking in 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.

### The 1973 Missions: Final Mars Attempts

The engineers' fears came true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>.
*   **Mars 4** (Orbiter) flew by Mars on February 10, 1974, without entering orbit due to a failure in its brake system, likely related to faulty transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. It took some photos before entering solar orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.
*   **Mars 7** (Flyby-Lander) reached Mars on March 9, 1974, and released its Lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. However, transistor failures in the Lander's computer systems caused it to miss the planet by about 1,300 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.
*   **Mars 5** (Orbiter) successfully entered Martian orbit in February 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. A slow pressure leak forced ground control to accelerate its three-month science program to just three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. Mars 5 took 108 high-resolution images and studied the atmosphere, detecting water vapor and an ozone layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. Pressure levels declined too far by February 28, but the mission was largely considered accomplished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.
*   **Mars 6** (Lander) had the most impressive story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:59">[00:38:59]</a>. Two months after launch, it lost the ability to send telemetry data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. Despite this, ground control could send programs, and Mars 6 remarkably autonomously measured its position, calculated a correct trajectory, and entered orbit around Mars in March 1974, releasing its entry probe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. A backup radio channel confirmed its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>. Sadly, the Lander failed to land safely, with transmission cutting off near the Margaritifer Sinus region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

## Conclusion of the Soviet Mars Program

Despite some scientific gains from the 1973 missions, Soviet leadership largely viewed the "all-out assault" as a failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. The program's chief designer, Vasili Mishin, was dismissed, and Valentin Glushko was elevated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>. Glushko shifted the Soviet space program's focus towards the Buran space shuttle and Energia launcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>.

As a result, fewer resources were allocated to the Soviet planetary space program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. While Mars advocates still planned ambitious missions like Project 5NM for Martian soil return, leadership pragmatically decided to concentrate on Venus, where they had a clear advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. For the next decade, the Soviets primarily launched Venera missions, achieving significant advancements in Venusian science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>.

A final push to explore the Martian moon Phobos occurred in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>. Phobos 1 failed to enter Mars orbit due to a faulty command and computer logic error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. Phobos 2 arrived and photographed Phobos but a malfunctioning computer prevented it from releasing its Lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

The Soviet Mars program was fundamentally defined by its [[historical_space_race_between_us_and_ussr | competition]] with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>. This political importance granted substantial resources but also imposed arduous political requirements, leading to poor execution, and combined with bad luck, foiled Soviet success on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>. Any achievements were far eclipsed by those of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>. Nevertheless, the attempt to send 15 robots millions of kilometers to another planet was "truly incredible" and worthy of admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>.

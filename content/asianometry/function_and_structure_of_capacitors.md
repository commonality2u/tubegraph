A capacitor is an electronic component that stores electricity, similar to a battery, but it discharges its electrical energy very quickly, sometimes in a few microseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The term "capacitor" may be familiar from discussions on DRAM, as it is conceptually similar and subject to the same laws of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Basic Structure

The fundamental structure of a capacitor consists of two electrically conductive plates, known as electrodes—the anode and cathode—which are separated by a material called the dielectric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Electrolytic Capacitors (E-caps)

[[electrolytic_capacitors_and_their_components | Electrolytic capacitors]], often referred to as E-caps, are a common type due to their ability to offer good capacitance (meaning they hold a lot of charge) for their size and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Components and Assembly
The name "[[electrolytic_capacitors_and_their_components | electrolytic capacitor]]" refers to the electrolyte, which acts as the capacitor's cathode or negative electrode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This electrolyte can be a solid, gel, or liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

An E-cap typically consists of:
*   **Aluminum Foil Strips:** Two strips of aluminum foil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Separator Layer:** A very thin separator layer, often made of porous paper or tissue, placed between the foil strips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Electrolyte Saturation:** The paper and the gap between the foil strips are saturated with the electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Anode Coating:** The positive electrode (anode) foil is coated with a layer of aluminum oxide, which serves as the dielectric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Housing:** The entire assembly is rolled up and placed in a sealed protective housing, typically made from aluminum, to prevent the electrolyte from drying out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Vent:** There may be a vent at the top to release built-up gas, preventing a messy explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Factors Affecting Charge Storage
A capacitor's ability to hold charge is directly related to the surface area of its electrodes and inversely related to the distance between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. To maximize capacitance:
*   The thin separator paper allows the dielectric to be extremely thin, bringing electrodes as close as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   Manufacturers often etch the aluminum foil to increase the electrodes' surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Uses of E-caps

E-caps are widely used in electronic devices, with a typical PC motherboard containing around 60 of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Beyond PC motherboards, E-caps are found in camcorders, VCRs, televisions, stereos, and LCD screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Key applications include:
*   **Filtering:** In power supply modules, capacitors help smooth out inconsistent DC power produced by rectifiers, which convert AC power. Capacitors charge when voltage peaks and discharge when voltage dips, creating a steady output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Decoupling:** Capacitors are used to smooth out power supply fluctuations going to sensitive chips like microprocessors. They absorb voltage spikes and discharge to boost voltage dips, acting like "drainage ponds" for floods or dry periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Industry Overview
The [[electrolytic_capacitors_and_their_components | aluminum E-cap]] industry is a multi-billion dollar sector, valued at approximately $3 to $3.5 billion in 2002 and $5 to $6 billion today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Major suppliers are predominantly Japanese, Taiwanese, or Chinese, collectively producing billions of units annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. In 2002, Taiwan alone produced 22.5 billion E-caps, accounting for 30% of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Aging and Failure
As electrochemical devices, [[electrolytic_capacitors_and_their_components | electrolytic capacitors]] naturally age and corrode, generally having shorter lifespans (about 10-20 years) than other capacitor types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

*   **Parametric Failure:** A common sign of aging is an increase in Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) and a slow decline in capacitance before a sharp drop at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Factors like humidity and heat can accelerate this aging, as heat can cause the electrolyte to dry out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Catastrophic Failure:** In severe cases, capacitors can bulge (leading to no capacitance and a short circuit) or even explode, potentially causing fires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. In the early 2000s, this became a widespread issue, often accompanied by a "weird, fishy smell" in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

The electrolyte composition is a critical trade secret, determining the capacitor's operating conditions, including temperature, voltage, and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. These are complex chemical formulations with many components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Studies of bulging capacitors found their electrolytes often lacked a "depolarizer," an additive that reduces gas generation within the E-cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. This absence, combined with a lack of protective ions like phosphate in the aluminum oxide dielectric, led to the dielectric dissolving into the alkaline electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. This thinned the dielectric layer, unnaturally increasing capacitance, which is a key indicator of bulging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. The exposed aluminum foil reacted with impurities, generating electrons that then reacted with hydrogen ions in the water-based electrolyte to create hydrogen gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

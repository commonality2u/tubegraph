The global semiconductor industry is currently experiencing a significant shortage, particularly impacting trailing edge (mature and legacy) semiconductors, which are crucial for many everyday applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This article explores the nature of these nodes, the reasons behind the shortage, the challenges in addressing it, and ongoing investment efforts.

## What are Trailing Edge Nodes?

Most chips produced are not advanced, "sexy" 3-nanometer processors but rather unheralded workhorses built with trailing edge process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The definition of a trailing node varies, but TSMC classifies anything at 16 nanometers or older as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. These nodes generated approximately 50% of 2021 revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Trailing edge nodes can be further subdivided:
*   **Mature Nodes**: Generally considered to be in the 40 to 450 nanometer range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Legacy Nodes**: Anything older than the mature range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Most microcontrollers, like the Microchip Technology ATSAMD21 (a 48MHz ARM chip selling for about $3-4), are manufactured using 110 or 180 nanometer processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. These chips are deployed in automation, metering, and industrial manufacturing, and as of early 2022, many are out of stock for a year or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

There are approximately 200 fabs operating globally, with most built before 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. These factories initially produced leading-edge chips with high margins, but as the industry advances, their products commoditize, and prices collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. However, once built, a fab's operational costs are relatively low, allowing them to continue production as long as market prices exceed variable costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## The Chip Shortage and Trailing Edge Nodes

Fab capacity for trailing edge nodes was already tight for several years before the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The initial pandemic lockdowns in early 2020 caused economic activity to plummet, leading automotive companies and other manufacturers to halt production and cancel chip orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. For example, STMicroelectronics cut production by 50% at their most advanced fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

However, a massive and unexpected bounce back in economic activity that same summer led to companies rapidly depleting inventories and subsequently buying more than needed to replenish stock and ensure future output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Concurrently, the broader semiconductor industry experienced unprecedented demand due to the cloud, 5G transition, and armed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Since 2019, fab utilization rates have soared to the mid-90s, far exceeding their long-term target of 80%, indicating that foundries are at their production limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Microchip executive chairman Steve Sanghi stated that an additional $150 billion investment over five years is needed to meet trailing edge demand growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Despite hundreds of billions committed to new fabs globally, only 6% is allocated to mature or legacy node capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Challenges in Investing in New Trailing Edge Fabs

Investing in new trailing edge fabs is complex due to several factors:
*   **Price Expectations**: Customers are accustomed to low prices set by foundries with fully depreciated fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Wafers for these nodes are cheap, accounting for only 10% of total sales revenue despite significant microprocessor volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Financial Underperformance**: Building a new fab costing hundreds of millions or billions is expected to lead to substantial underutilization and financial underperformance, making companies hesitant to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Equipment Availability**: Many trailing edge foundries use older, niche equipment. Over 200 fabs utilize 200-millimeter wafers, which are smaller than the current 300-millimeter standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. New 200-millimeter equipment is scarce, leading companies to rely on refurbished items, and supply is currently short due to high utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Reasons for Continued Reliance on Trailing Edge Nodes

While leading-edge chips like those needing extreme ultraviolet lithography get significant attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, several factors ensure the continued importance and demand for trailing edge nodes:
*   **Difficulty of Scaling Certain Chip Types**: Some chips, such as analog mixed-signal, radio frequency (RF), and MEMS (specialty silicon found in accelerometers), do not scale well to smaller nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Demand for these chips is very high, particularly due to the Ukrainian war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **The 28-22 Nanometer Generation Gap**: The 28-nanometer node is arguably the most advanced still using a planar gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Newer nodes require more complex FinFET gates, rampant multi-patterning, and potentially EUV, leading to increased complexity, less reliable products, lower yields, and higher costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The 28-nanometer node represents the bottom of the cost curve on a per 100 million gate basis, meaning newer nodes get more expensive per gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Automotive Industry Demand**: Automotive companies, which consume 40% of trailing edge chips, prioritize reliability and effectiveness under challenging conditions over raw speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Current and Future Investments

Recognizing that backlogs for older nodes are stretching 18 months or longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, the industry is beginning to act:
*   **Building New Fabs**:
    *   **TSMC**: While building an [[tsmc_n2_process_node_and_new_fabs|N5 plant in Arizona]], TSMC is also constructing two new trailing edge fabs (28-22 nanometer range) in Japan and Kaohsiung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. TSMC recently increased prices on older nodes, likely to fund these new fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
    *   **Samsung**: Announced increased investment in trailing edge semiconductor capacity, a notable shift from their typical focus on leading-edge technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
    *   **China**: Has up to a dozen new fabs under construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node|SMIC]], the leading Chinese foundry, is investing over $9 billion to add trailing edge wafer capacity in Shanghai and Shenzhen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
    *   **India**: Conglomerate Vedanta and Foxconn have signed an MOU to build a trailing edge fab (65-28 nanometer range) with substantial [[government_subsidies_and_investments_in_semiconductor_manufacturing|government support]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Government Support**: The U.S. CHIPS Act appropriated $2 billion specifically for mature technology nodes, with the definition to be determined by the Secretary of Commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

## Alternative Solutions to Increase Trailing Edge Output

Beyond building new fabs, other strategies can boost existing trailing edge capacity:
*   **Wafer Size Upgrades**: Converting from 200-millimeter to 300-millimeter wafers can more than double die output due to the laws of numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. While this requires significant changes to floor layout and automation systems, it avoids building a new fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **Design-Side Improvements**: New tools and open-source EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software, such as the open-source 130-nanometer PDK released by Google and SkyWater Technologies, can make it easier for designers to perform die shrinks or design for different nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This can lead to faster and better chips for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## Outlook

Addressing the supply constraints in the trailing edge segment will take time, at least one to two years, with shortages expected to continue until at least 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. However, some positive signs are emerging:
*   Suppliers are reporting a slowdown in revenue growth for trailing edge nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   Major players, along with China and India, are accelerating efforts to build new fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   An apparent slowing in the macro economy could dampen overall demand, potentially aligning with the increased supply capacity hitting the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) was founded in 1945 and became a pivotal institution in the early development of [[development_and_expansion_of_indias_nuclear_program_including_international_relations | India's atomic energy program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. It was established with the goal of fostering world-class scientific research in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Founding and Vision

The establishment of TIFR was largely spearheaded by [[role_of_dr_homi_bhabha_in_indias_nuclear_development | Dr. Homi Bhabha]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Initially, Bhabha viewed his involuntary extended stay in India during World War II as a temporary career disruption, wishing to return to the United Kingdom or the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, even seeking opportunities at Princeton or CalTech in 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. India at the time was turbulent due to its independence struggle and not conducive to cutting-edge science, leaving Bhabha feeling intellectually isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

However, as India's independence became increasingly apparent around 1943-1944 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, Bhabha recognized an opportunity to significantly contribute to his new nation and address the disadvantages left by its colonial past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The trustees of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, the philanthropic arm of the Tata family, also saw an opportunity to retain an eminent scientist in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

In March 1944, Bhabha formally requested funds from the Trust to create a "vigorous school of research" dedicated to world-class science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. He envisioned a school centered around a single individual (himself) with autonomy to pursue its mission, following the model of celebrated physics and science schools in the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Role and Funding

TIFR was officially founded in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It received a substantial budget that saw 15-30% annual growth during its first two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This generous funding and independent structure allowed TIFR to become the "cradle of Indiaâ€™s atomic energy program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Through TIFR and his other connections, [[role_of_dr_homi_bhabha_in_indias_nuclear_development | Dr. Homi Bhabha]] gained access to Prime Minister Nehru, further solidifying the institution's central role in India's scientific and nuclear ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

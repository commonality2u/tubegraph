The creation and emergence of the operating system [[the_origins_and_development_of_unix | Unix]] was a special moment in technology history, born in part from the struggles of an ambitious predecessor: Multics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Origins and Purpose

In 1965, scientists at Bell Labs joined peers from MIT and General Electric on a project called "Multiplexed Information and Computing Service", or Multics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The primary objective was to create a general-purpose utility for sharing time on a computer system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. At the time, computers were extremely expensive, necessitating time-sharing operating systems to allow multiple users to efficiently share resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. These systems evolved into communication tools, connecting users with public profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

General Electric, which sold time shares for its computer systems, offered the Multics team access to a GE 645 mainframe computer, simulated with a 635 machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Ambitious Concepts

Multics explored several innovative concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, including:
*   **Arbitrary file names and directory structures** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   **A virtual memory system** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>: This allowed secondary storage, like hard drives, to be used as if it were part of the main memory (RAM), enabling the computer to handle more data than its physical RAM capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This was a significant improvement over existing file systems and is still used today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

The Multics team aimed to integrate these groundbreaking, previously un-implemented ideas into a single commercial product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Challenges and Withdrawal

Looking back, the Multics project was perhaps too ambitious, akin to "trying to boil the ocean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Progress became a "slog," characterized by excessive spending on too few people following a vague plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Frustrated by the lack of a workable product, Bell Labs formally withdrew from the Multics project in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Soon after, General Electric decided to exit the computer industry entirely, selling its division to Honeywell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The termination of Multics meant the loss of the GE 635 computer, which the team had been using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Legacy

Despite the official end of Multics, a few scientists at the Bell Labs Computing Science Research Center—Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Rudd Canaday, Doug McIlroy, and J.F. Ossanna—continued working on concepts related to the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This continuation ultimately led to the development of what would become [[the_origins_and_development_of_unix | Unix]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

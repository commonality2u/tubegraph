[[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]], or Micro Electro Mechanical Systems, are microsystems that combine both electric and mechanical functions, built using the same advanced techniques as integrated circuits (ICs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Despite the miraculous nature of this technology, the [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]] industry has historically faced several significant economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## [[Historical development of MEMS technology | Early Development and Applications]]

The dream of making extremely small devices dates back to Richard Feynman's 1959 lecture, "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom," where he discussed manipulating atoms to create useful tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The first real [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]] product, the resonant gate transistor, was developed in 1967 by Harvey Nathanson at Westinghouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This transistor, about one millimeter long and made of gold, could move using electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

[[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]] gained significant traction in 1979 when Hewlett-Packard used silicon micromachining to develop an inkjet nozzle for thermal inkjet technology, which became a highly successful [[Commercial applications of MEMS in industry sectors | application]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. In the 1990s, the [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]] industry found another major [[Commercial applications of MEMS in industry sectors | commercial use]] in sensors for acceleration, pressure, and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Notable [[Commercial applications of MEMS in industry sectors | examples]] include:
*   **Automotive Airbag Sensors:** Analog Devices created the first commercial acceleration [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]] sensor in 1991, which was less than one square centimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This monolithic system was smaller, more reliable, and cost significantly less (around $5) compared to older mechanical systems (hundreds of dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Over 60 million [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]]-based airbag sensors alone have been sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Medical Pressure Sensors:** Used for monitoring blood pressure in hospitals, [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]] versions cost about ten dollars, a fraction of the over $600 for early external sensors, making them disposable and easier to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Today, the medical [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]]-based sensor industry is valued at over six billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Consumer Electronics:** [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]]-based inertial sensors are found in modern consumer electronics like the Nintendo Switch controllers, providing gyroscope and accelerometer capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Other [[Commercial applications of MEMS in industry sectors | applications]] include visual displays and optical switches using micro-mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Production and Economic Challenges

The [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]] industry faces significant [[Challenges of working in semiconductor manufacturing | challenges]] in its production and economic models, often related to [[Design and manufacturing processes of MEMS | design]] and "back-end" steps like testing and packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

### [[Design and manufacturing processes of MEMS | Design Difficulties]]
Designing [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]] is highly specialized and complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Unlike VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) semiconductor [[Design and manufacturing processes of MEMS | design]], which uses a modular approach with generic modules and standardized cell libraries, mechanical [[Design and manufacturing processes of MEMS | design]] lacks such standardization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Scale-Specific Physics:** Miniaturizing things does not guarantee the same behavior; for instance, friction forces are significantly stronger than inertia at the micro-scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Tiny flow spaces are prone to blockages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Customization:** While VLSI objects primarily process signals, mechanical objects must often contain liquids, rotate, slide, or support loads—sometimes all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This leads to [[Design and manufacturing processes of MEMS | MEMS]] [[Design and manufacturing processes of MEMS | design]] being "extremely custom," tailored to specific weight, space, and energy restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Software Support:** Although companies like CoventorWare and IntelliCAD offer CAD and design automation software for [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]], aiding in understanding microstructure [[Design and manufacturing processes of MEMS | design]] and electromechanical behaviors, the fundamental customization remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### High Packaging Costs
The majority of a [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]]-based sensor's price, often 75% to 80% of the final cost, comes from its packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This is a stark contrast to integrated chips, where packaging plays a secondary support role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Fundamental Interaction:** Unlike ICs, which are systems in themselves, [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]] must intimately interact with the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. A pressure sensor, for example, cannot be encased in a hard plastic case; it needs specialized packaging to sense pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Circumstance-Specific Packaging:** The packaging for each [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]] die must be remade for its particular circumstances; a pressure sensor [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]] requires different packaging than a micro-mirror array <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This adds substantial cost and engineering effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. For instance, an HVAC pressure sensor, priced at $20-$30, has most of its cost in packaging, with the raw die costing less than 50 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

### Yield and Price Erosion
Analog Devices, an early investor in [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]], experienced this firsthand; it took nine years for their in-house manufacturing facility for airbag sensors to become profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Yield Impact:** Yield is the single biggest influencing factor for product cost in the [[Challenges of working in semiconductor manufacturing | semiconductor]] industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. A 10% yield means 9 out of 10 [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]] products are unusable, significantly increasing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Achieving high yields is difficult, leading to overly optimistic projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Relentless Market Price Erosion:** [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]] products face relentless market price erosion, sometimes as high as three to five percent each quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This eats away at margins and discourages investment in potentially exciting new possibilities, such as micropropulsion technologies for cube satellites or [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]]-based lidar mirrors for autonomous cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### Lack of Widespread Standardization and Collaboration
Despite being called the "second silicon revolution" due to its ability to create microscopic moving parts that are smaller, cheaper, and more effective than larger counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, the [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]] industry's creativity and diversity make widespread standardization difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   **Absence of Industry Bodies:** The [[Introduction to MEMS and their applications | MEMS]] industry lacks organizations like Sematech or DARPA, which typically work within an industry to map out a way forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   **Need for Cooperation:** For the industry to reach its full potential, the various players—designers, foundries, vendors, and end-users—need to collaborate more closely to establish standards and find solutions to the under-invested issues plaguing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

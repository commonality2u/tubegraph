In 1969, [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] made the decision to unbundle its software and hardware, a significant event in technology industrial history driven by the threat of an American anti-trust lawsuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Previously, [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] and other computer companies provided software as part of an overall computing services bundle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. This unbundling assigned a price to what was previously free, enabling small software companies to compete against giants like [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. In the United States, this act effectively created the software industry as it is known today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

## Japanese Response: "Little IBMs"

In Japan, the impact of [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]]'s unbundling manifested differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. Instead of fostering an independent software industry, it allowed Japanese computer manufacturers to establish software subsidiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. These subsidiaries "adopted" [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]]'s specifications through reverse-engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

An early example of this strategy was Fujitsu, which began selling an "IBM-compatible" mainframe as early as 1971, marketing it as faster and cheaper than [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]]'s offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. Fujitsu refined this compatibility with the help of Gene Amdahl, the former chief architect of the System/360 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

Japanese computer companies rarely used the software "as is." They modified it to display Japanese kanji symbols, with each company developing its own approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. Additionally, software was often customized to fit customers' existing business practices, a strategy that helped the Japanese companies lock in customers and charge more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. Consequently, Japanese computer companies effectively became "little IBMs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. This approach allowed companies like Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC to survive despite a persistent technological lag behind American competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

## The IBM Spy Case and its Aftermath

This widespread use of reverse-engineered [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] software was illegal and amounted to theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. For over a decade, [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] took little action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. This was partly because definitive copyright protections for software were not established until the Copyright Act of 1976 took effect in 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>, and [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] was preoccupied with a major anti-trust case in the US that lasted until 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

Once the anti-trust case was resolved, [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] focused on the ongoing theft of its software by Japanese companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. In 1982, [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] confronted Fujitsu, Hitachi, and others with these allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Hitachi and Fujitsu argued that the System/360 OS was in the public domain when they adopted it, and its specifications were so widely used they constituted a standard not subject to copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

The situation escalated into the "IBM Spy Case" in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. The US government arrested 18 Japanese employees, some senior, from Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric in a sting operation, charging them with stealing technical secrets from [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. This event created significant tension between the US and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the Japanese firms settled. Fujitsu, for instance, paid a one-time lump sum and annual licensing fees of up to $60 million, and agreed to respect [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]]'s IP rights going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. These significant software fees threatened the competitiveness of Japanese computer manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

The Japanese government, through [[mitis_role_in_japans_computer_and_software_industry_development | MITI]], attempted to intervene, proposing to amend copyright laws to limit software protection from 50 years to just 15 years in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. This proposal failed to take hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>, highlighting the severity of the "[[japans_digital_trade_deficit_in_software | Japanese Software Crisis]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. For years, Japanese computer companies had built their business on closed-source foreign software, a strategy that now backfired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

## Long-Term Consequences

The reliance on reverse-engineering and customization, while initially allowing Japanese hardware companies to compete, had long-term negative [[effects_of_international_competition_and_policies_on_japans_software_market | effects on Japan's software market]]:

*   **Lack of Independent Software Companies**: Unlike the US, where [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]]'s unbundling spurred the creation of independent software giants like Adobe and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>, Japan saw a failure of such companies to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. This was attributed to factors like lack of customer acceptance, insufficient venture capital, an unwieldy lifetime employment system, and a cultural lack of initiative or risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.
*   **Continued Dependence**: Without domestic alternatives, Japanese tech providers remained dependent on software imports from companies like [[comparison_between_icl_and_ibm | IBM]] or Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.
*   **Struggles in the 1990s**: The "little IBMs" model struggled to adapt after the Japanese real estate bubble burst in 1990, leading to a cost-conscious environment where expensive software modifications were no longer affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. The traditional [[mitis_role_in_japans_computer_and_software_industry_development | MITI]] playbook of reverse-engineering and cheaper production, effective for industrial goods like steel or automobiles, proved ill-suited for software, which thrives on widely held standards, network effects, and user familiarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>.
*   **Cementing Foreign Dominance**: The fall of NEC's PC-98, a hardware-accelerated MS-DOS version for Japanese language, due to the entry of foreign-made software and hardware in the early 1990s, cemented Microsoft's dominance in the Japanese market. No domestic Japanese software maker has credibly challenged this American giant since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>.

The unbundling, while a catalyst for software innovation globally, highlighted and exacerbated the distinct path Japan took in its software industry development, leading to long-term challenges related to foreign dependence and a less vibrant domestic software ecosystem.

At its peak, China's [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]] presided over an estimated $170 billion of assets globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The conglomerate was a significant shareholder in Deutsche Bank and Hilton Hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, owned airports and real estate in Germany, China, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, and held the third largest aircraft leasing business in the world with over 900 planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Most of these assets were acquired in just a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, with the company executing at least one multi-million or billion-dollar transaction each month by May 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Early Growth and Funding Strategies

HNA's origins trace back to Hainan Provincial Airlines, established in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Initial capital was 10 million RMB from the Hainan government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The company restructured as a joint stock company, raising 250 million RMB (approximately $35 million) from 122 stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Co-founder Tun Fung and his team secured an additional 600 million RMB ($84 million) in bank loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### Innovative Borrowing and Investment

HNA employed creative [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna | financial strategies]] for borrowing, including:
*   **Re-mortgaging Assets**: Initially, HNA leveraged a unique situation where Chinese banks, unfamiliar with mortgage practices, assigned property rights of purchased planes to the borrower (HNA). This allowed HNA to re-mortgage the same plane to another bank for more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Borrowing Against Future Revenue**: HNA also borrowed against the future revenue streams from a plane's air routes, effectively mortgaging each plane twice: once as a hard asset and again with its future revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, enabling rapid growth through double-dipping leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **George Soros's Investment**: In 1995, George Soros's Quantum Fund invested $25 million in Hainan Airlines, marking the first Chinese-American joint venture in China's aviation sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Soros later doubled his investment to $50 million in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, with his stake eventually reported to be worth $110 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The Quantum Fund sold its stake in 2011 due to HNA's lack of corporate transparency and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Expansion into Airlines

After renaming itself Hainan Airlines in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, HNA began consolidating smaller airlines. In 2001, it acquired China Xinhua Airlines, Tangshan Airlines, and Chang'an Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, integrating them into a new four-way entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This strategic focus on short and medium-range flights outside major routes, which were dominated by state-owned carriers, proved successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Diversification within Tourism

HNA vertically integrated its businesses to benefit from Hainan's growing tourism industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This included owning airports, hotels, and travel agencies to serve tourists arriving on Hainan Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. HNA became the first Chinese airline to purchase and own its own airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

## The "Super X" Plan: Global Acquisition Frenzy (2010-2017)

Following the 2008 global financial crisis, which ironically presented cheap overseas targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>, HNA launched its "Super X" plan with the ambitious goal of accumulating 1 trillion RMB ($148 billion USD) of assets in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. From late 2010 to 2017, HNA spent billions acquiring hotel brands, technology companies, urban real estate, and airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This frenzy peaked between 2015 and 2017, with 123 acquisitions totaling $50 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

### Key Acquisition Categories:

#### Travel Industry
*   **Hong Kong Airlines & Hong Kong Express**: Acquired in 2006, these purchases provided HNA with its first international routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Aigle Azur**: A 48% stake in France's second oldest cargo airline was bought in 2012, giving HNA permission to fly into Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **Minor Airline Stakes**: In 2015, HNA bought stakes in South Africa's Comair and Brazil's Azul, despite not having direct flight routes to these regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
*   **Swissport**: A $2.8 billion purchase in 2015 of the cargo handler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Gate Group**: A $1.5 billion purchase in 2016 of the Swiss airline catering business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

#### Hotels
*   **NH Hotel Group**: Starting in 2011, HNA built up a 29.5% stake in the Spanish hotel group, then Europe's third largest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
*   **Carlson Hotels (Radisson)**: Acquired in 2016 for an undisclosed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. This acquisition caused a conflict of interest as Carlson and NH Hotel Group were direct competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
*   **Hilton Hotels**: In 2016, HNA bought a 25% stake from Blackstone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

#### Logistics and Shipping
*   **Jinhai Shipyard & Tianjin Marine Shipping**: Acquired to support plans for a global container shipping business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   **Ingram Micro**: A $6 billion purchase by Tianjin Marine Shipping in 2016, of a global IT equipment distributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This acquisition was considered strange due to Ingram Micro's low-profit margin and limited presence in China at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. It received regulatory approval from CFIUS, a rarity for China-U.S. technology deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

#### Financial Sector (HNA Finance & Leasing)
HNA aimed to build a financial arm, HNA Finance, focused on heavy asset leasing and insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   **Avolon**: Acquired in 2009 after its collapse during the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. It was moved to Hong Kong and merged into Bohai Capital Holding, a corporate vehicle for heavy asset leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.
*   **GE SeaCo**: Bohai spent $1 billion (excluding debt) in 2011 to acquire the fifth largest container leasing fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **Cronos Group Limited**: An 80% stake was acquired in 2015 and merged with SeaCo to scale up the container leasing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.
*   **Avolon (Irish Leasing Company)**: Bohai paid $7.6 billion in 2016 to buy Avolon, making HNA the fourth biggest airplane leasor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   **CIT Group's Aircraft Leasing Business**: Purchased in 2017 for $10 billion, financed largely by Morgan Stanley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. This acquisition made HNA's combined fleet 910 aircraft, the third largest in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

#### Other Notable Acquisitions
*   **Kai Tak Airport Land**: A $1.1 billion purchase in 2016 of land under the former airport in Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.
*   **Frankfurt Hahn Airport**: A majority stake was acquired in March 2017, HNA's first and only international airport acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
*   **Deutsche Bank**: A 9.9% equity stake, valued at $4 billion, was built up in early 2017 through a complex web of offshore companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. HNA claimed to be Deutsche Bank's largest shareholder and secured a board representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
*   **245 Park Avenue, New York City**: A $2.21 billion purchase, closed in May 2017, was one of New York City's largest real estate transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.
*   **Dufry Group**: In April 2017, HNA acquired a 16.8% stake in the world's largest duty-free shop chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

## Funding the Acquisitions

The vast majority of HNA's acquisitions were financed through debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. Key funding sources included:
*   **Land and Land Development**: HNA shifted from mortgaging aircraft to mortgaging land development projects and other hard assets across China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. They partnered with indebted provincial and city governments on infrastructure projects, leasing assets to help governments bypass debt limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. These projects were spun into publicly traded subsidiaries whose stock prices skyrocketed, allowing HNA to pledge shares for more loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.
*   **Complex Capital Structure**: HNA's structure evolved into a complicated web of China-based investment entities, including 10 publicly traded companies on Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets and seven on Hong Kong markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Acquisitions were injected into this web and re-mortgaged for additional funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. The ownership and debt links became so intricate that it was difficult to ascertain who owned what <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

## The End of the Acquisition Frenzy

The aggressive acquisition strategy and reliance on debt ultimately led to the [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | collapse of HNA Group]]. In June 2017, the China Banking Regulatory Commission ordered risk checks on HNA's overseas borrowing and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. Major banks ceased accepting HNA shares as pledges for new loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>, and credit rating agencies downgraded its debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. By January 2018, HNA announced plans to sell off 100 billion RMB of assets and return to its core airline business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. Many of its publicly traded affiliates had their shares suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.

Despite a rapid sell-down of assets, the devastating impact of COVID-19 on HNA's core airline and travel businesses delivered a final blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. In February 2021, HNA finally entered [[bankruptcy_and_restructuring_of_hna_group | bankruptcy proceedings]] with $170 billion of acknowledged debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.

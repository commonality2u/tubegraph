[[History and evolution of Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGA | Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)]], which are integrated circuits that can be reprogrammed after manufacture to emulate a digital circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, have become commercially successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The story of their development is a mix of technology and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, significantly influenced by Moore's Law.

## Early Challenges for FPGAs

The first [[Differences between FPGA PAL PLA and ASIC | FPGA]], the Xilinx XC2064, was introduced in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Initially, it faced significant challenges:
*   **High Cost:** The XC2064 was a large chip, straining manufacturing abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This resulted in extremely low yields, making the first FPGAs cost hundreds of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   **Difficulty of Use:** The newness of FPGAs made them harder to use, requiring complex electronic design automation (EDA) software that was difficult to master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Performance Prediction:** Their performance was not easy to predict beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

These challenges led to FPGAs being significantly more expensive and harder to use than their predecessors, such as [[Differences between FPGA PAL PLA and ASIC | PALs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

## Moore's Law as a Catalyst for FPGA Growth

Despite their [[Early challenges and developments in FPGA technology | early shortcomings]], FPGAs took hold and thrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a> due to a fortuitous intersection of technology and business opportunity, notably Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>:

*   **Classical Scaling and Transistor Costs:** As maturing lithography technologies accelerated classical scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, transistor costs crashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. FPGAs, unlike [[Differences between FPGA PAL PLA and ASIC | PALs]], were designed to scale effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, allowing them to benefit greatly from these advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **Interconnect Advancements:** Crucially, a new process called chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) drastically lowered the costs of making the interconnects within FPGAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This enabled FPGAs to exponentially grow their lookup table counts and interconnect wire lengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Performance:** Moore's Law helped the initial slow and limited FPGAs become faster and more powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

This technological progress, driven by Moore's Law, directly addressed the high costs and limitations of early FPGAs, making them more competitive.

## Business Opportunities Enabled by Scaling

The era of scaling also coincided with significant [[Impact of generational shifts in the semiconductor industry | shifts]] in the semiconductor business model:

*   **Rise of Independent Foundries:** The early 1990s saw the rise of independent foundries, with companies like Altera and Xilinx pioneering the "fabless" startup model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This allowed design companies to focus on innovation without needing their own manufacturing facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Foundries, in turn, could concentrate on refining their processes, finding that large-die FPGAs were excellent for honing their manufacturing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
*   **FPGA Market Expansion:** The FPGA market blossomed with new startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>, which introduced optimizations and new features. Xilinx and Altera absorbed the intellectual property and patents from these companies, adding them to their own product lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.
*   **Software Control:** Unlike [[Differences between FPGA PAL PLA and ASIC | PAL]] manufacturers who relied on third-party EDA software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, [[Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGA | FPGA]] companies controlled their own EDA tools. This allowed them to dictate their future, crafting software to enable more features and adding automation for greater productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

## Current and Future Landscape

Today, FPGAs are widely used across various industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. As [[Differences between FPGA PAL PLA and ASIC | ASICs]] become increasingly expensive to design and fabricate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, FPGAs fill a valuable market gap, particularly in aerospace, military, and telecom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. They continue to gain new functionalities and expand into areas like AI processing and data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

Though major players [[Industry shifts and acquisitions in the FPGA market | Altera and Xilinx]] have been acquired by Intel and AMD respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>, FPGAs' "Swiss army knife" functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a> continues to be a unique story in silicon valley, reflecting the industry's innovative power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. While challenges remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, the continued [[Emerging trends and challenges in chip design | evolution]] of FPGAs is deeply intertwined with the ongoing advancements promised by Moore's Law.

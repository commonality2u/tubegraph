Despite its area cuisine not being particularly known for wheat, Indonesia is the world's second-biggest consumer of instant noodles, with 14.5 billion servings consumed in 2023, according to the World Instant Noodles Association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. An astonishing 99% of Indonesia's 285 million people have eaten instant noodles at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

Another country that stands out on the list of top instant noodle consumers is Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The Indonesian noodle brand Indomie is extremely popular there, likely being the single most popular packaged food in all of Africa, occasionally even appearing in rap lyrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This article explores how a noodle brand from Indonesia became a sensation in Nigeria and the rest of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Beginnings in Indonesia

Indomie's dominant position today traces back to Indonesia's authoritarian second President, Suharto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Suharto frequently partnered with Chinese entrepreneurs, such as Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim) of the Salim Group, to industrialize the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

In 1967, Suharto requested food aid in the form of rice from the US government, but received wheat instead, as the US and Australia had limited rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Since Indonesia lacked milling facilities, the raw wheat had to be milled in Singapore, which was not ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Sudono Salim sought advice from Malaysian Chinese tycoon Robert Kuok, whose empire included flour mills, and Kuok suggested building mills in Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. In 1969, Salim and Kuok partnered to found Bogasari Flour Mills, which quickly became Indonesia's dominant flour miller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Kuok initially received a 25% share but lost it when Salim merged Bogasari into his Indocement company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Instant Noodles & Indomie's Launch

Instant noodles were first popularized by Taiwanese-Japanese entrepreneur Momofuku Ando, who pioneered the flash-frying method for pre-cooking instant noodles in the wake of World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. He founded Nissin, which is now the second-largest noodle giant by revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

In 1972, Indonesian entrepreneur Djajadi Djaja from North Sumatra founded a company called Indomie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The name "Indomie" means "Indonesian Noodles" ("Mie" means noodles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Indomie was not the first instant noodle brand in Indonesia; Supermi launched two years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. However, while Supermi used imported flour, Indomie bought its flour locally from Bogasari at cheaper prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## From Flour to Noodles

Initially, the Salim Group's Bogasari business simply sold flour to noodle and bread makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Indonesians traditionally preferred rice over wheat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

During a rice shortage in the late 1970s, the Indonesian government requested Bogasari to provide and promote an alternative food for its military and civil officials to spare rice for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Bogasari invested in expensive instant noodle machinery and launched marketing campaigns promoting flour-based products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

However, the rice shortage reversed in the 1980s due to new strains and fertilizers, achieving Indonesia's rice self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This created a business problem for Bogasari, which had acquired capacity for 2 billion packs of instant noodles annually but now had no government buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

To utilize this excess capacity, Bogasari launched its own instant noodle brand, Sarimi, directly competing with its customer, Indomie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Sarimi quickly captured 40% of the market due to low production costs from its integrated milling business and a $10 million marketing campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. In 1984, Djajadi Djaja merged Sarimi and Indomie to create a joint venture called Indofood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. A few years later, Indofood also acquired Supermi, consolidating the Indonesian instant noodle market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Initially, Salim owned 42.5% of the joint venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Within a few years, they acquired the remaining shares from Djajadi, who later claimed he was forced to sell due to debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. After Suharto's fall, Djajadi sued Indofood for compensation, but the Indonesian Supreme Court eventually ruled against him after a seven-year legal battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Indomie's Product Evolution and Domestic Dominance

For years after its early 1970s launch, Indomie was primarily sold in a soup format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. In 1982, Indomie launched a soup-less dry version called Mi Goreng ("fried noodles"), which was an instant hit due to its easier preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

By 1994, Indofood controlled about 80% of the Indonesian instant noodles market through its three brands: Indomie (60% share), Supermi, and Sarimi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Instant noodles are popular due to their cheap price, ease of cooking, and taste, enhanced by MSG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Urban dwellers often eat Indomie Sayur (with green vegetables) as a complete meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Indofood sells over 110 flavors to accommodate Indonesia's diversity, with Mi Goreng remaining the most popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Indomie is also halal, which is significant in the worldâ€™s largest Muslim population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Spreading Out Globally

Indomie noodles began their international expansion in the late 1980s, initially through word-of-mouth as Indonesian foreign workers brought them abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Indofood eventually caught on and formed partnerships with local companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

Indomie has seen significant success in the Middle East and Africa, where its halal status likely helps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. In Saudi Arabia, Indomie claims over 95% of the instant noodle market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. An Indomie factory in Syria has remarkably remained open throughout the civil war, providing cheap food for locals, with government intervention preventing its closure several times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

The most significant global impact for Indomie has been in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## Indomie in Nigeria

Nigeria is a highly diverse country with over 500 ethnolinguistic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Its cuisine traditionally blends indigenous carbohydrates like yams and cassava with beans and local meats, influenced by Portuguese and British colonial history, adding elements like tomatoes and curry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Wheat and wheat-based noodles were not traditional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Yet, in 2023, Nigerians consumed about 3 billion servings of instant noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

### The Role of [[the_role_of_tolaram_corporation_in_indomies_nigerian_success | Tolaram Corporation]]

The entry of Indomie into Nigeria was facilitated by [[evolution_of_tolaram_into_a_consumer_goods_and_infrastructure_leader | Tolaram Corporation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Founded by Khanchand Vaswani in 1950 in Indonesia, [[evolution_of_tolaram_into_a_consumer_goods_and_infrastructure_leader | Tolaram]] started as a textile shop and expanded into chain retail, known for sourcing products in bulk for price advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. In 1975, [[evolution_of_tolaram_into_a_consumer_goods_and_infrastructure_leader | Tolaram]] moved its headquarters to Singapore to support international trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

In 1977, Mohan Vaswani, Khanchand's son, decided to open operations in Nigeria, becoming one of the first Singaporean companies to do business there, trading electronics, textiles, and fishing nets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Despite Nigeria being under military rule and experiencing a foreign exchange crisis in the early 1980s, [[evolution_of_tolaram_into_a_consumer_goods_and_infrastructure_leader | Tolaram]], as a private, family-controlled company, could afford to invest for the long term; its first textile factory in Nigeria lost money for almost nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

### Indomie's Success in Nigeria

In 1988, [[the_role_of_tolaram_corporation_in_indomies_nigerian_success | Tolaram]] began importing Indomie noodles to Nigeria, an idea proposed by Haresh Aswani, who recognized Indomie's success in Indonesia and believed it could be replicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Nigeria's young and rapidly urbanizing population seemed similar to Indonesia's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

[[indomies_market_strategies_and_challenges_in_nigeria | Tolaram]] initially positioned Indomie as a food for kids, targeting busy mothers with large families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. However, sales got off to a rough start as Nigerians were unfamiliar with the food, initially mistaking the noodles for worms and not knowing how to cook or eat them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. [[indomies_market_strategies and_challenges_in_nigeria | Tolaram]] had to educate the public through demonstrations in supermarkets, schools, and even during traffic jams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Sales volumes remained low for the first six years after market entry in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

Despite slow initial sales, [[the_role_of_tolaram_corporation_in_indomies_nigerian_success | Tolaram]] doubled down on its investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Recognizing that freight costs accounted for 40% of the product cost, they decided to manufacture locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. In 1995, a joint venture with Indofood called De United Foods was formed, granting [[the_role_of_tolaram_corporation_in_indomies_nigerian_success | Tolaram]] the rights to manufacture, brand, and sell Indomie noodles across West Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. They built their first noodle factory in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

The joint venture continued to lose money for several years, almost causing Indofood to pull out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. However, in June 2000, [[the_role_of_tolaram_corporation_in_indomies_nigerian_success | Tolaram]] launched a new flavor, Onion Chicken, alongside a massive marketing campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Onion Chicken, along with other flavors like Pepper Chicken and Jollof, propelled Indomie to become the most popular noodle brand in Nigeria, surpassing competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. It took 10 years for Indomie noodles to become profitable and 12 years to exceed $10 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. After that, sales doubled annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. By 2010, they were producing a billion packs a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Today, over half a dozen plants across Africa produce noodles for Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt, and Eswatini, and Indomie remains dominant despite over 17 new competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## A Consumer and Infrastructure Giant

Indomie's success from 2000 onward shifted [[evolution_of_tolaram_into_a_consumer_goods_and_infrastructure_leader | Tolaram's]] strategic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Convinced that B2B commodity products had no future after the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 and the rise of China, [[evolution_of_tolaram_into_a_consumer_goods_and_infrastructure_leader | Tolaram]] scaled down other businesses like electronics assembly and textiles to focus on growing consumer brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

This required significant investment in vertical integration, with [[evolution_of_tolaram_into_a_consumer_goods_and_infrastructure_leader | Tolaram]] opening its own packaging, seasoning, flour, and oil mills to ensure raw ingredient supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. Furthermore, due to Nigeria's poor infrastructure, [[evolution_of_tolaram_into_a_consumer_goods_and_infrastructure_leader | Tolaram]] had to "pull in" basic utilities like electricity, water, and waste processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

[[the_role_of_tolaram_corporation_in_indomies_nigerian_success | Tolaram's]] long-term commitment and experience in Nigeria, particularly through its formidable distribution company Multipro, made it an ideal platform for other consumer brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. They formed joint ventures with Kellogg (2015) for breakfast cereals and snacks in West Africa, Arla (Danish-Swedish dairy cooperative) for dairy products in Nigeria, and Colgate-Palmolive (2019) for dental health products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. In June 2024, [[evolution_of_tolaram_into_a_consumer_goods_and_infrastructure_leader | Tolaram]] acquired a majority stake in Guinness Nigeria Brewery from Diageo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

In addition to its consumer business, the [[evolution_of_tolaram_into_a_consumer_goods_and_infrastructure_leader | Tolaram Group]] has become involved in significant infrastructure and real estate projects in West Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. In 2019, they raised about a billion dollars to build the Lekki Deep Sea Port near Lagos, which can handle large container ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. [[evolution_of_tolaram_into_a_consumer_goods_and_infrastructure_leader | Tolaram]] received a 45-year concession and aims to make the port as significant as those in Singapore or Dubai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. The port is intended to be the core of a larger industrial ecosystem called the Lagos Free Zone, a privately owned free trade zone for foreign companies to sell imported goods in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. This trajectory highlights the profound impact of a seemingly simple product like 20-cent instant noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

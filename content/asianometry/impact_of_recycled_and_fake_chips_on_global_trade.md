The issue of counterfeit semiconductors poses a significant risk across various industries, from critical military applications to commercial products, impacting global trade through economic losses, safety concerns, and supply chain integrity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This problem is deeply intertwined with the recycling of electronic waste and illicit manufacturing practices.

## Defining Counterfeit Semiconductors

A counterfeit semiconductor can be broadly defined in several ways:
*   A previously used electronic part sold as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   Unauthorized copies of an authentic electronic product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

More comprehensively, a semiconductor is considered counterfeit if it:
*   Is an unauthorized copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   Does not conform to the original manufacturer's design, model, or performance standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Is not produced by the original manufacturer or its authorized contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   Is off-specification, already used, defective, or misleadingly labeled as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Is incorrectly marked or has wrong documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Scale and Economic Impact

[[semiconductor_industrys_counterfeit_chip_problem | Counterfeit microchips]] are a significant economic issue. In 2019, the OECD estimated that the global volume of counterfeit and pirated products, including semiconductors, amounted to up to 3.3% of total global trade, or over $500 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

For the American semiconductor manufacturing industry, counterfeiting was estimated to cost over $7.5 billion a year in lost revenue and 11,000 jobs in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. In 2008, the Bureau of Industry Security identified 7,114 detected counterfeited microcircuit incidents across 387 companies within the defense industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

Data tracking is difficult because government databases like the Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP) are not anonymous, leading victims to shy away from reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. However, organizations like the Electronic Resellers Association International track incidents, noting 504 reported semiconductor counterfeit cases in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Real-World Consequences: Military Incidents

[[counterfeit_microchips_and_military_incidents | Counterfeit microchips have led to dangerous incidents]], particularly in critical military applications:

*   **F-16 Ejection Seat Malfunction**: In 2020, an F-16 ejection seat malfunctioned, causing a pilot's death. An investigation of the seat's sequencer revealed several counterfeit microchips, though their precise role in the incident remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.
*   **P-8A Poseidon Ice Detection Module**: A 2011 US Congressional committee investigation highlighted an incident involving a P-8A Poseidon plane. The ice detection module's controlling component, identified as a Xilinx FPGA unit, was counterfeit and literally fell out of its socket after the plane took off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The counterfeit chip was traced back to an affiliate of an electronics manufacturer in Shenzhen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

These incidents highlight the challenge faced by defense contractors and system integrators who often need to use older parts for repair and maintenance, as original manufacturers may no longer produce them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The US government places the onus of detection on contractors, with the National Defense Authorization Act of 2013 threatening civil and criminal penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. A notable case involved Vision Tech in Florida, which knowingly sold fake chips from China and Hong Kong as military-grade goods, generating nearly $16 million in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## How Counterfeits Enter the Supply Chain

Counterfeit chips primarily enter the supply chain through:

### Recycling
Recycling is one of the most common methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The process involves:
1.  Receiving scrap electronics and removing printed circuit boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
2.  Heating boards over an open flame to melt solder and loosen components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
3.  Bashing boards to dislodge components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
4.  Removing original markings using various methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
5.  Sorting, reprocessing, and applying new coats and markings to make them appear new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

These e-waste components are old, worn out, and further damaged by the harvesting process, often resulting in non-functional chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Relabeling or Remarking
Relabeled or remarked chips have false markings that misrepresent their model, origin, certifications, capability, or quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. An actor acquires chips, wipes their markings, and applies new ones to make them seem more premium or expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This is particularly problematic for components requiring enhanced specifications, like military-grade chips hardened against radiation or temperature damage, where cheaper commercial parts may be swapped in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

Recycling and remarking account for approximately 80% of all counterfeiting incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Foundry Overproduction
Many semiconductor companies contract overseas foundries to produce their chips without third-party oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Some foundries may produce more chips than contracted for, then resell the excess as counterfeits, profiting from valuable designs without R&D investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Unauthorized Clones
Unauthorized clones are chips developed by third parties to save on expensive R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Their design IP can be obtained through reverse engineering (e.g., using electron microscopes) or illegal acquisition of design IP at various stages of the chip design and manufacturing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. While functionally similar, clones often deviate from the original in technology and process, leading to erratic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Detection and [[anticounterfeiting_measures_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Anti-Counterfeiting Measures]]

[[methods_of_detecting_counterfeit_chips | Detecting counterfeit chips]] is a nuanced challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Common methods include:

*   **Physical Methods**: Inspecting for defects in the chip's exterior, packaging, connections, bonding wires, or die. Techniques include external visual inspection (EVI), X-ray, or destructive de-lidding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Electrical Methods**: Testing for changes in component parameters (parametric tests) or proper functioning (functional tests). These are effective but time-consuming and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

Design-for-counterfeit measures can also be implemented:
*   **Unique IDs**: Programming a chip with a unique, non-programmable ID that can be read throughout its lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **Physical Unclonable Features (PUFs)**: Creating a unique "fingerprint" for the chip using random variables from the fabrication process (e.g., Arbiter PUFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

Despite these methods, the primary reason counterfeit chips enter the supply chain is the opportunity and incentive for illicit profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

## Economic Drivers and Geographic Shifts

The incentive for counterfeiting is high: harvesting and desoldering old chips from e-waste can cost as little as 10 cents per chip, while certain types can sell for $1 to $10, or even up to $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This creates a significant profit margin, up to 100 times the harvesting cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

Historically, most fake recycled and relabeled chips originated from China, where much of the world's e-waste was sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. However, in 2017, [[impact_of_export_bans_and_political_influence_on_chinese_semiconductor_industry | China banned the import of 24 types of solid waste]], including plastic and e-waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. While some e-waste is still smuggled, significant imports have been redirected to new countries. For instance, Thailand saw a 5.7 times increase in e-waste imports after China's ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

This shift in e-waste flow indicates a potential geographic redistribution of the counterfeit chip problem, impacting new regions involved in the recycling and illicit trade of electronic components. The overall consequence of counterfeit chips, whether in military equipment, airplanes, or cars, is serious harm when a chip fails to perform as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

South Korea's economic strength is intricately linked to its massive business groups, known as chaebol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Names like Samsung, Hyundai, and LG are familiar worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These groups are the engine of the country's export economy and deeply integrated into the daily lives of its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. However, their pervasive influence also allows them to manipulate the Korean economy to their benefit, maintaining [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | corrupt ties]] with the highest levels of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Historical Roots of Chaebol Influence

The [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | history of corruption]] in Korea predates the modern state, with the Japanese colonial agricultural economy also being highly corrupt and unequal, where large landlords exploited farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Many of these legacies were inherited by the new South Korean government after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Syngman Rhee and the First Chaebol Creation

South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee, established the initial chaebol to raise funds for the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Starting in 1946 and peaking in the 1950s, his government privatized numerous assets seized from the former Japanese state and other state-owned entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The sale prices were determined through private negotiation rather than public auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Valuable companies such as Tong Yang Beers (now Oriental Breweries), Daehan Textile, and Tong Yang Cement (part of the Tongyang Group) were among those sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The purchasers of these assets would eventually become the chaebol, similar to Japan's zaibatsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Park Chung-hee's Crony Capitalism Pact

In 1961, Park Chung-hee led a military coup and initially arrested chaebol heads on corruption charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. However, his government quickly negotiated a [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | crony capitalism]] deal with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Park sought to emulate Japan's industrialization and needed the chaebol's support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Under this arrangement:
*   The chaebol would support Park's policies for import substitution and later exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   The Korean government would provide foreign currency loans at below-market interest rates to help them acquire foreign technologies and build industrial capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Chaebol also contributed funds, in the form of 10-15% loan commissions (kickbacks), for Park's presidential campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This system incentivized companies to maintain close ties with the president to access cheap capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Park maintained close personal ties with figures like Chung Ju-yung of Hyundai and Kim Woo-jong of [[rise_and_fall_of_daewoo_group | Daewoo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Kickbacks grew significantly over the years; before 1972, the top five chaebol contributed over 800 million won annually to the Park government, increasing to 1.5 billion won after 1972 (adjusted to 1990 prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Chaebol Dominance and Societal Impact

For two decades, the government and chaebol effectively ran Korean society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Companies funded political campaigns and contributed to economic growth, while the government granted privileges and shifted the costs of chaebol excesses onto society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   In 1971, when chaebol were over-leveraged, the government bailed them out by converting private market loans into five-year public ones and freezing private interest rates, which negatively impacted small lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

By the mid-1980s, the balance of power shifted decisively in favor of the chaebol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>:
*   The top five chaebol accounted for nearly 20% of the country's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   They also produced 45% of its mining and manufacturing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   The top ten chaebol owned an average of 8.6 manufacturing businesses and 20-40 businesses in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

This chaebol-centric strategy suppressed the growth of small and medium-sized businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. From 1966 to 1976, the number of manufacturing firms grew only 10%, while their size exploded by 176% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. In contrast, Taiwan, with a less cozy state-business relationship, saw its manufacturing firms grow by 150% in number and 29% in size over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Public Disapproval and Democratic Transition

The vast imbalance between the chaebol and the rest of the country became a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. As the public grew wealthier, they demanded more than just higher wages; they sought better environmental regulations, working conditions, and an overall better quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The government, increasingly democratic, shifted from a stance of support to one of regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Despite democratization in 1987, political parties lacked established campaigning norms and above-board financing systems, making them vulnerable to continued chaebol influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Chaebol continued to contribute billions of won to high-level political campaigns under subsequent administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This ensured they continued to receive government aid in the form of plentiful capital, favorable regulations, and protection from competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Consequences and Reforms After the Asian Financial Crisis

The [[impact_of_financial_crises_on_south_korean_business_practices | Asian Financial Crisis]] of 1997 exposed the consequences of Korea's inability to rein in its large businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. In the decade after democratization (1987), the chaebol gained substantial political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. For example, in 1988, [[rise_and_fall_of_daewoo_group | Daewoo Group]] successfully lobbied the National Assembly to amend laws to bail out its ailing shipbuilding corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

This power was used to push for rapid liberalization reforms, aiding their growth and expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   One reform allowed chaebol easier access to foreign capital financing, leading to a massive [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] boom that culminated in the Asian Financial Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   Another reform permitted chaebol to take limited ownership stakes in non-bank financial companies, encouraging complex cross-ownership structures that obscured their true size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. For instance, the Lee family controlling Samsung Group owned a minority of shares but exercised operational control over almost all affiliated companies through complex cross-holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   These structures meant that it was unclear which subsidiaries were profitable and which were not, leading to profitable companies propping up weaker ones and resulting in market inefficiencies and oversupply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The 1997 crisis significantly curtailed the chaebol's power, opening the door for reforms aimed at preventing future financial crises by limiting [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] capacity and cross-shareholder structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   For example, Hanjin Shipping was forced to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio below 200%, leading it to sell ships and lease others to retain capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This relates to the [[Korean Governments Decision on Shipping Bailouts | Korean Government's Decision on Shipping Bailouts]].
*   The Korean car industry, which had five independent companies in 1997, consolidated to just one (Hyundai) shortly after the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   Chaebol reduced their number of affiliates (e.g., from 819 in 1997 to 544 in 2000) and increased dividends to minority shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

The crisis also spurred the creation of the Korean export juggernaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Realizing an unfriendly domestic environment, the biggest chaebol leveraged free trade agreements in the 2000s and turned outwards, becoming wildly successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. By 2013, 86% of Samsung's revenue came from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This success drove Korea's top-line economic recovery, with an average GDP growth rate of 5% from 1998 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## Persistent [[social_inequality_and_economic_reforms_in_south_korea | Social Inequality]]

Despite impressive GDP growth, the benefits of this growth were concentrated among a small cohort of people, leading to a significant gap between the "haves" and "have-nots" in Korean society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. In 2013, chaebol brought in over 50% of revenue and value add in the manufacturing sector but employed less than 20% of the sector's employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. As part of the post-1997 reforms, the government agreed to make it easier for chaebol to lay people off in exchange for increased profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This resulted in hundreds of thousands losing their jobs, many of whom have since struggled to find regular salaried work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Elder poverty in Korea has reached four times the OECD average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, and the income share for the top 1% of Korean society rose from 7% before 1997 to 12% by the mid-2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The Korean people recognized this inequality and felt they shared none of the success of their "national champions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## Political Responses and Ongoing Challenges

The public's discontent led to a vote for change in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. President Lee Myung-bak, a conservative and former CEO of Hyundai Construction, emphasized economic recovery and implemented policies to strengthen the chaebol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. He lowered corporate tax rates, raised ceilings on non-bank financial investment, and amnestied executives convicted after the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. His goal was to restore the era of rapid economic growth seen under Park Chung-hee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. However, unlike Park, Lee did not force chaebol to invest profits into new and risky industries, instead channeling money into "rust-built" industries like construction and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. His administration failed to deliver the promised growth, and he was later arrested on charges of bribery, embezzlement, and tax fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

Subsequent political shifts, like President Park Geun-hye's blend of nostalgia and welfare emphasis, still avoided key reforms such as a higher capital gains tax, which is crucial to the accelerating wealth gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

### Modern Corruption and Regulatory Capture

Modern [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | corruption]] by the chaebol focuses on maximizing their wealth and market power through tax manipulations and regulatory capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. The consequences of this can be dire, as exemplified by the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking, which claimed 304 lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. While the ferry was old and overloaded, the high death rate was primarily due to ignored safety and rescue regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. The regulatory agency and the ferry company had a close relationship, ignoring violations and maintaining a profitable status quo, including the rotation of government employees into the industry and the company's monopoly privilege on a lucrative ferry route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

The struggle with chaebol dominance continues in South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. President Moon Jae-in responded to Park Geun-hye's corruption scandals with business reforms and higher tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. However, the South Korean economy is heavily dependent on these powerful global companies, and substantial reforms risk weakening their competitive position against international giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Chaebol reform remains a furiously debated and polarizing issue in South Korean politics, alongside concerns about North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

In the years immediately following World War II, Japan experienced a severe panic over methamphetamine abuse, with widespread addiction and associated crime considerably changing the country's attitudes towards such drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. By 1948, an estimated 5% of Japanese males between 16 and 25 were addicted to methamphetamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, while another survey found that 30% of 20 to 22-year-olds had either tried or were using stimulants like amphetamines and meth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Headlines frequently reported attacks by delusional meth addicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This period is often referred to as the [[japans_postwar_methamphetamine_crisis | Heropon Panic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Discovery and Early Characteristics of Methamphetamine

Methamphetamine was first synthesized by Japanese scientist [[dr_nagayoshi_nagai_and_the_discovery_of_methamphetamine | Dr. Nagayoshi Nagai]] in 1893 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Nagai, one of Japan's first scientists to train abroad, isolated ephedrine from the Chinese herb *ma Huang* (Chinese ephedra) in 1885 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. His original methamphetamine compound was named M33N, being his 33rd extract from the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Initially, few people paid attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Later, in 1919, Akira Ogata, a student of Nagai at the University of Tokyo, synthesized a more potent variant known as crystal meth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Crystal meth easily crosses the blood-brain barrier, triggering a rapid release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (inducing feelings of well-being), norepinephrine (priming for fight-or-flight), and serotonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This results in a quick rush of energy and euphoria lasting 8 to 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

However, excessive use can lead to hallucinations, delusions, and sleeplessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Withdrawal symptoms include decreased energy, anxiety, irritability, and disrupted sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Injection, a common method for a faster high, contributes to higher rates of HIV and hepatitis C due to shared needles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Initially, meth was used in Japan as a cough suppressant, bronchodilator for asthmatics, or to treat depression and lethargy, but it was not widely popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## [[methamphetamine_use_in_the_japanese_military_during_world_war_ii | Methamphetamine Use in the Japanese Military During World War II]]

During World War II, the German Army adopted methamphetamine (Pervitin) for its stimulant effects in 1938 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Japan, influenced by this, approved the commercial sale of amphetamine and methamphetamine without limitation in 1941, with the latter, being more addictive, becoming more popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Dai Nippon Pharmaceutical Company, led by Kenosuke Miura, produced Philopon (or Hiropon), introduced in 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Meaning "loving labor," Philopon became synonymous with all stimulants for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. These drugs were marketed as "Awakening drugs" or "wakeamines," advertised for "night work and other times demanding mental alertness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

As the war progressed, the Japanese military extensively adopted methamphetamine:
*   Sentries on night duty received "cat eye tablets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   Munitions factory workers received tablets to work through the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   Kamikaze and special forces took "storming tablets," a mix of meth and green tea powder stamped with the emperor's crest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Air pilots reportedly received meth injections, believing them to be "nighttime vision hormones" from Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

The military stockpiled massive amounts of these drugs, calling them a "Mainland decisive battle weapon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Postwar Methamphetamine Crisis

The [[impact_of_world_war_ii_on_japanese_economy | post-war situation]] in Japan was catastrophic, marked by chaos, unemployment, and severe food shortages, exacerbated by millions of soldiers returning home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Many Japanese turned to alcohol and drugs to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Signs of a meth crisis appeared as early as September 1946, with Tokyo's first meth addict admitted to hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Sources of Supply
The drugs fueling the crisis came from three main sources:
1.  **Pharmaceutical Companies:** Drug makers, including the 20 wartime manufacturers, dumped their massive post-war supplies into the civilian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. They advertised heavily, claiming to help Japanese people overcome tiredness while rebuilding the country, while also seeking to profit in a terrible economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Meth was often cheaper than alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
2.  **Military Stockpiles:** Despite efforts by American occupation forces to seize and destroy wartime military drug caches, many slipped through their grasp, scattered across islands, hospitals, supply depots, and caves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
3.  **Informal Markets and Crime Gangs:** Drugs were "diverted" by corrupt servicemen and distributed by crime gangs on the streets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Methamphetamine, known as "Shabu" (speed), was easily produced in small "mom-and-pop labs" using ingredients from Hong Kong pharmacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Many returning soldiers simply brought their pills home, unaware of the hazardous side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### Public Perception and Catalysts for Change
Initially, many Japanese, including soldiers, were ignorant of meth's dangers, viewing it as harmless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Contemporary documents reflected this, noting the "seeming positive upsides" of these drugs for work attitudes and stamina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

However, two public deaths attributed to drug abuse began to shift public attitudes:
*   In October 1946, comedian Miss Wakana died of a heart attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   In January 1947, novelist Sakonosuke Oda died of a hemorrhage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
Although their deaths may not have been directly due to meth overdose (Wakana was clean, Oda likely died from tuberculosis), newspapers seized on their known drug habits and attributed their deaths to stimulant abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Further incidents fueled public concern:
*   In October 1950, nearly 100 young people were arrested near Urawa City in connection with a mass sexual assault incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Many perpetrators suffered from hallucinations and delusions linked to Neo-Agotine, a meth drug produced by Toyama Chemical. Toyama had produced over 10 million vials monthly, far exceeding its quota of 51,000, yet was fined only $14 as the quota was merely a guideline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   The April 1954 violation and murder of primary school girl Kyoko Hasada in a school bathroom by a 20-year-old meth addict, Shikichi Sakamaki, captured national attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Sakamaki, found with 500 vials of meth and two needles, reportedly said, "Even I myself cannot understand why I committed such a crime. Maybe it was hitopon that led me to do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

This murder triggered an avalanche of meth-related headlines, reporting random stabbings and drownings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. In May 1954, half of the 60 reported murders were linked to meth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Media commentators fueled the panic, declaring a "time of moral decay" or "moral insanity" in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

## [[government_and_police_actions_to_control_methamphetamine_in_japan | Government and Police Actions to Control Methamphetamine in Japan]]

In 1949, the Japanese government began discussing controls on Philopon distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The debate initially focused on street orphans committing crimes to fund their habits, but ultimately concluded that the root cause lay with adult dealers and smugglers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

Despite continued public belief in meth's positive role as a work productivity booster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, and the tendency to blame "immoral people" like entertainers rather than the drug itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, the need for better controls became evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Legislative and Enforcement Measures
In June 1951, Japan passed a Stimulant Control Act, criminalizing the import, manufacture, trafficking, receipt, and possession of these drugs, especially when associated with other crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Police rapidly implemented the law, arresting 17,528 people for stimulant-related offenses in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

However, the 1951 law lacked teeth, with a maximum three-year prison sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This merely shifted meth production from informal labs to organized crime, like the Yakuza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. By 1954, the epidemic worsened, with an anonymous census finding 7.5% of respondents aged 15-30 using methamphetamine, 75% of whom injected over five vials daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. The Ministry estimated over half a million abusers in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

In response, Japan amended its Stimulant Control Act in June 1954 to crack down harder on the drug trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Arrests skyrocketed, with 6,000 people arrested in four months post-amendment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Police reorganized to focus on both demand and supply, conducting large-scale raids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Indictments surged from 43% in 1953 to 63%, and over 9,000 violators were jailed between 1951 and 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

### Public Awareness Campaigns
The police heavily invested in public awareness campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Case studies of addicted individuals revealed a common pattern: initial unawareness of danger, use for productivity, unexpected addiction, and subsequent hallucinations and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. This informed the police's strategy to educate the public, especially young people, as 50% of addicts took their first dose between ages 15 and 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

Over 24 million yen was spent on posters, pamphlets (225,000), leaflets (470,000), and posters (385,000) warning against stimulant drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Some posters were optimistic, encouraging people to "Wipe Out the evil of stimulant drugs," while others were shocking, depicting syringes plunged into a teenage boy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Special focus was placed on students, who faced exceptional stress during year-end examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Lectures, roundtable discussions, and presentations were held at schools, factories, workplaces, and nightclubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. By 1955, a survey found that only 3% of youths had never heard of Hiropon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

### Societal Blame and Xenophobia
During this period, considerable blame was directed at foreign Korean and Taiwanese populations, euphemistically called "Third Country residents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. A nationalist narrative emerged, painting the epidemic as originating from "bad forces abroad," possibly Communists smuggling drugs into the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. This narrative helped shift public attitudes against methamphetamine use by framing it as a threat to Japan's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

In 1954, the Tokyo Police claimed that 70% of illegal meth labs were run by Koreans, failing to mention that they specifically targeted Korean villages east of Tokyo for drug raids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. This dubious data exacerbated problems for ethnic minorities already suffering from discrimination and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

## End of the Panic
Sustained police activity led to a decline in drug crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. By 1957, census cards showed a decline in methamphetamine use among the Japanese population, and offenses and arrests decreased annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. By 1962, the [[japans_postwar_methamphetamine_crisis | Heropon Panic]] had largely ended, with meth-related arrests declining to 300-800 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

However, many young people simply switched to sniffing solvents, with crimes related to solvent abuse skyrocketing to 20,000 in 1968 and 50,000 in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

The [[japans_postwar_methamphetamine_crisis | postwar meth crisis]] in Japan was caused by abundant legal and illegal supply, a lack of public awareness about the drug's addictiveness, and terrible economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. The resolution of the panic involved changing the supply and awareness factors, coupled with the alleviation of the economic hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

In 2016, Hanjin Shipping, once South Korea's largest container shipping line, abruptly filed for reorganization, leading to global chaos in the shipping industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The company, which had been the world's fourth-largest container line, operated 97 ships and called on 90 ports in over 35 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Its collapse stemmed from a combination of industry volatility, macroeconomic shifts, and internal corporate challenges.

## Early Foundations and Government Reliance

[[history_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] was established in 1977 as a part of the Hanjin Group, one of South Korea's *chaebol* (large business groups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The Hanjin Group, founded by Cho Chun-hun in 1945, initially focused on transportation, securing early contracts from the US Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. To fund its expansion, Cho Chun-hun secured generous loans from state banks, aligning with President Park Chung-hee's economic growth plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

The Korean government actively nurtured its indigenous container shipping capacity, which was minimal in the early 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. New policies encouraged the development of containerized shipping lines, leading to 36 ships and five international container services within four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. By 1976, the government explicitly subsidized Korean container carriers and established the Korea Maritime and Port Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. [[history_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] benefited from this policy push, rapidly expanding its services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Inherent Volatility of the [[Container Shipping Industry Dynamics | Shipping Industry]]

The [[container_shipping_industry_dynamics | shipping industry]] is characterized by significant volatility, with demand tied to macroeconomic factors, seasonality, and sudden shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. While demand can fluctuate wildly (e.g., 20% year-over-year), supply is much less flexible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Options for adjusting capacity, such as acquiring competitors, commissioning new ships, or chartering, all carry significant risks and costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Misjudging market conditions when expanding or shrinking a fleet can be disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Hanjin Shipping faced an early test of this volatility when the [[Container Shipping Industry Dynamics | shipping industry]] was impacted by the 1979 oil crisis and subsequent macroeconomic slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Although the Korean government consolidated shipping lines and offered aid, Hanjin Shipping did not receive a public bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Instead, its sister company, Korean Air, had to temporarily intervene in 1986 to help Hanjin through tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Aftermath of the Asian Financial Crisis (1997)

The Korean export boom of the 1990s concluded with the [[impact_of_financial_crises_on_south_korean_business_practices | Asian financial crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. South Korea, one of the worst-hit countries, received a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This came with strict policy changes:
*   **Market Liberalization**: The Korean government was compelled to liberalize its shipping business, opening the market to foreign competitors much faster than initially planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Debt Reduction Mandate**: All Korean business conglomerates were mandated to reduce their [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]]-to-equity ratios to below 200% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This forced Hanjin Shipping, along with other Korean lines, to sell off ships they owned to pay down [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] and charter new ones to maintain capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This "sale-leaseback" strategy improved [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]]-equity ratios but led to significantly higher operating costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This combination of increased costs and foreign competition contributed to a long-term decline in Korea's indigenous shipping lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## Founder's Death and Family Splintering

In 2002, Hanjin founder Cho Chung-hun died, leading to a split of his transportation empire among his five children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Cho Su-ho, one of his sons, received Hanjin Shipping, while the eldest son, Cho Yang-ho, became Hanjin Group chairman, retaining Korean Air and other remaining parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. This splintering meant that [[history_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] could no longer rely on its corporate siblings, like Korean Air, for undeclared bailouts during hardships, as it had in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This sibling rivalry put the company on dangerous ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

## [[Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on Shipping | Global Financial Crisis of 2008]] and Overcapacity

A brief recovery in 2007-2008 prompted Hanjin Shipping to invest heavily in a new round of mega-ships, ordering nearly a quarter-million TEU worth of ships, a 40% increase in their fleet size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. However, these orders were placed at the exact wrong time, coinciding with the [[impact_of_the_global_financial_crisis_on_shipping | Titanic economic slowdown]] following the [[impact_of_the_global_financial_crisis_on_shipping | global financial crisis of 2008]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This sparked a severe shipping overcapacity crisis, with trade between the U.S. and Asia declining by 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

The prolonged oversupply led to mounting losses and soaring [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Hanjin's [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] increased from 195 billion Korean Won ($165 million USD) in 2012 to 440 billion Won ($375 million USD) by 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Asset Stripping and Financial Distress

To manage its escalating [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]], Hanjin Shipping began stripping itself of its most profitable assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This included selling domestic and overseas terminals, as well as its liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker and bulk shipping divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Eventually, only the volatile container shipping line remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

In 2016, Korea Development Bank (KDB), Hanjin's largest creditor, demanded 700 billion Won ($615 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The company could only propose 500 billion Won ($440 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

## [[Korean Governments Decision on Shipping Bailouts | Government's Decision Not to Bail Out Hanjin]]

A critical factor was the [[korean_governments_decision_on_shipping_bailouts | Korean government's decision not to bail out Hanjin Shipping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Unlike other nations that supported their shipping lines (e.g., Denmark with Maersk, Germany with Hapag-Lloyd, China with COSCO and China Shipping), Korea opted against a bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. KDB had also been dealing with Hyundai Merchant Marine, and while Hyundai was able to meet restructuring demands and get capital injections, Hanjin could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

The government's stance, influenced by public sentiment against corporate bailouts, was a significant departure from its historical role in supporting the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. This decision had severe consequences, as Hanjin Shipping was unable to secure the necessary financial backing, leading to its bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

## Immediate Impact of Collapse

Hanjin's insolvency caused widespread disruption:
*   159 companies were unable to retrieve their cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
*   $4 billion worth of goods, including critical Korean exports like Samsung electronics (40%) and LG products (20%), were stranded at sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   Tens of thousands of shipyard jobs in Korea and the Philippines (where Hanjin owned the Subic Bay Shipyard) were annihilated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

## Conclusion

Hanjin Shipping's collapse was primarily due to two factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>:
1.  **Working Capital Crisis**: Despite owning profitable assets, poor chartering practices burdened the company with unprofitable ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. The splintering of the Hanjin Group after the founder's death meant no "rich sibling" company could provide a bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
2.  **Lack of Government Support**: While other shipping companies making similar mistakes received government backing, the Korean government decided against a bailout for Hanjin, marking a shift in its long-standing policy of supporting the industry as a core national interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

With over 1.3 trillion Korean Won ($1 billion USD) in charter fees owed over the next year, Hanjin Shipping declared bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. The last ship belonging to Hanjin Shipping was sold off for demolition in March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

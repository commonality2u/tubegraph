Each year, the world loses 1-2% of its hydropower capacity to [[effects_of_silt_and_sediment_on_reservoirs | river silt and sediment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Silting gradually diminishes a dam's ability to store drinking water, generate power, and provide flood protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This necessitates costly preventive measures and interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Reservoir silting is a constant global concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Understanding Reservoir Sedimentation

Rivers transport two types of sediment:
*   **Coarse sediment**: Sands and gravels, typically originating from the riverbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Fine-grained sediment**: Smaller particles, about two millimeters wide, which can come from the riverbed or from clay and silt washed into the river by rains or human activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The total amount of sediment carried by a river is measured as "sediment yield," typically in units like tons per year per square kilometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

When a river is dammed to create a reservoir, its natural flow of sediment transport is interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Sediments begin to settle within the reservoir, eventually filling it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Over time, the accumulated sediment on the reservoir bottom reduces its water storage capacity, a situation known as reservoir sedimentation or silting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The storage lost to silting is termed "dead storage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Factors Exacerbating Silting

While silting affects every reservoir eventually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, certain [[geographical_influences_on_reservoir_silting | geographical and weather conditions]] can significantly worsen the problem.

### Taiwan Case Study
Taiwan's reservoirs are particularly susceptible to silting due to its geography and weather patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>:
*   **Mountainous Terrain**: Taiwan is heavily mountainous with many loose soils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Typhoons and Rainstorms**: The island experiences numerous typhoon storms with prolonged rainstorms that can last for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. These rains sweep loose soils into rivers, dramatically increasing sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Typhoon Morakot (2009)**: This typhoon, which dumped 277 millimeters of rain, deposited an estimated 90 million cubic meters of sediment into Taiwan's largest reservoir, the Zengwen Reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Such massive sediment loads combined with torrential rain can lead to fears of reservoir overflow and downstream damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Australian History
In Australia, where the economy heavily relies on surface irrigation from dams and reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, engineers largely disregarded reservoir sedimentation until the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Sparse data led to the false assumption of low sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. As a result, over 20 dams became fully silted between 1890 and 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Many of these older dams, some built for steam engines, are still in use for irrigation or emergency water storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Peak siltation occurred during large floods following major droughts, leaving dams unprepared for the influx of muddy floodwaters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Consequences of Silting

Beyond the primary impact on water storage and hydropower capacity, reservoir silting has other significant [[effects_of_silt_and_sediment_on_reservoirs | consequences]]:

*   **Navigation**: A silted reservoir impedes boat traffic and cargo transport, as accumulated sediment can block access to dam locks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Air Quality and Health**: When accumulated sediment dries up, it can become airborne, leading to dust storms and health hazards for local residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Hydropower Generation**: Sediment harms hydropower dams in multiple ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>:
    *   **Erosion**: Coarse sediments erode turbine runner blades, abrade gate seals, and damage spillways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   **Clogging**: Sediment can clog intake valves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   **Operational Disruption**: During Hurricane David in 1979, 17 meters of sediment blocked the Valdezia dam in the Dominican Republic, stopping power intakes for half a year, with dredging efforts continuing 28 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

Historically, reservoirs were designed with a presumed working life of around a hundred years, after which they were expected to be lost to siltation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. However, many dams are critical pieces of [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources | infrastructure]] that cannot simply be abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## [[methods_for_managing_reservoir_siltation | Methods for Managing Reservoir Siltation]]

Strategies for dealing with reservoir siltation generally fall into three categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>:

### 1. Sediment Yield Reduction
This approach aims to decrease the amount of sediment flowing into reservoirs from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The most significant cause of high sediment yields is upstream soil erosion, which can be mitigated by preventing erosion or trapping sediment before it reaches the dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

*   **Soil Erosion Control**: Human activities often cause soil erosion, particularly when poorer farmers cultivate sloping lands after deforestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Measures to protect soils from being washed away include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>:
    *   Reducing tillage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   Protecting denuded soil with mulch cover or vegetation like vetiver grass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   Terracing slopes into flat steps with dikes to prevent water and soil movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
    *   Despite numerous helpful methods, the challenge lies in the vastness and multi-governance of watershed areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. However, hard work pays off; in Australia, siltation rates significantly declined after the 1950s due to new farming techniques and land conservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

*   **Buffer Reservoirs/Sediment Traps**: Creating upstream buffer reservoirs or using existing dams as unintended sediment traps can reduce sediment before it reaches larger downstream reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. For example, the 39 major dams on the Paraná River, including the Itaipu Dam, inadvertently serve as sediment traps for the Yacyretá hydropower Dam downstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Farm Ponds**: On a smaller scale, an increase in farm ponds in Central Texas contributed to a 55% decline in sediment yield in the watershed, resulting in a twice-as-good siltation rate for local reservoirs compared to similar ones in other states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### 2. Sediment Routing
These tactics aim to prevent sediment accumulation at the reservoir's bottom by routing it around or through the reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

*   **Pass-through (Sluicing)**: Also known as "discharge the muddy water, impound the clean water," this involves a substantial, extended reservoir drawdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Dams must be designed with outlets large enough to handle flushing silt-heavy floodwaters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Many large Chinese dams, like the Yellow River's Sanmenxia Dam, employ this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Sediment Bypass Tunnels**: These tunnels divert sediment entirely around a dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. They are suited for medium-sized dams where normal pass-throughs might be less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The advantage is that they do not require flushing reservoir water levels and allow the river's natural water flow to continue, offering ecological benefits, though these tunnels are typically open for only two to five days a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Switzerland implemented some of the first bypass tunnels in the 1970s, followed by Japan in the late 1990s and 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### 3. Sediment Removal
Even with reduction and routing, silt and sediment will eventually enter a dam, necessitating removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

*   **Dry Excavation**: This invasive and costly method involves dewatering the reservoir (which can take up to a year) and then using conventional equipment to excavate the sediment slurry and truck it away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Costs vary significantly; in 1993, Los Angeles County dry excavated dams at costs ranging from $5 to $30 per square meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Dredging**: Commonly practiced to deepen river bottoms for shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, dredging can be done in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>:
    *   **Hydraulic Dredging**: Mixing sediment with water and pumping it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
    *   **Mechanical Dredging**: Using machine-powered clam shells or buckets to dig up sediment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
    Dredging is expensive and often reserved for large projects, and it may not be fast enough to keep up with high sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. For example, in Taiwan, $160 million spent on dredging only restored 8% of the Zengwen Reservoir's capacity due to high sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Underwater Explosions**: A proposed method to loosen sediment deposits for easier flushing or dredging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. In 2018, Taiwanese civil engineers used dynamite in the critically important Zengwen Reservoir, which provides 40% of its area's water needs, making pass-through methods impossible due to water loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. With an existing de-silting tunnel and mechanical dredging removing 2 million cubic meters annually (only 8-10 meters deep), dynamite was used to access deeper, more impacted sediment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. To protect animal life, engineers used underwater speakers, black pepper powder, and an air bubble curtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Experiments showed that free-drop explosions created 20-meter wide craters, and drilled-hole explosions loosened a 10-meter layer of sediment for six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Blasting was calculated to free up an additional 15% of reservoir capacity, and its continuation was recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## The Importance of Ongoing Maintenance

Engineers have tackled reservoir siltation since ancient times; for instance, the 1,700-year-old Monte Novo Dam in Rome had two outlets for flushing sedimented water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. However, societies can forget or lose the ability to maintain these structures, leading to predictable [[consequences_of_ignoring_reservoir_maintenance | consequences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Abandoned, silted reservoirs, such as the 1,800-year-old Roman-built Harbaka Dam in Syria, serve as reminders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. While some can be rehabilitated, others cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

Dams, though seemingly invincible, are pieces of human-built [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources | infrastructure]] that require continuous effort to maintain their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

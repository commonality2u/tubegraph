Historically, [[history_of_diamond_pricing_and_supply_control | diamond prices]] have had little to no relation to their extraction cost, with jewelry shop diamonds costing around $550 per carat and high-class diamonds up to $20,000 per carat, despite mining costs being only $58-$60 per carat, a figure remarkably stable over 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This inflated pricing is due to various supply cartels that carefully manage supply to maintain steady prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The emergence of the ability to create [[technological_advancements_in_diamond_synthesis_methods | gemstone quality diamonds]] has significantly impacted this market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## History of Diamond Market Control

The overpricing of diamonds is not a recent phenomenon; for centuries, market entities have controlled the supply to manipulate prices upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Even in antiquity, when Indian kings dominated diamond production, prices far exceeded extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. For example, in the 1500s, a half-carat diamond cost the equivalent of 30,000 days of an average laborer's wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

When diamonds were discovered in Brazil in 1725, a flood of new diamonds caused prices to spiral down by 30-50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The Portuguese Crown quickly took control of all mines and limited supply to stabilize prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

The most famous supply cartel was [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control | De Beers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The discovery of the 21.8-carat Eureka diamond in South Africa in 1866 sparked a diamond rush, increasing production from 100,000 carats in 1870 to 3 million carats in 1880 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Cecil Rhodes founded the [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control | De Beers]] Mining Company, which efficiently mined diamonds, reduced labor costs, and cracked down on theft by housing migrant workers in closed compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. By 1888, Rhodes and [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control | De Beers]] Consolidated the South African diamond mining industry and limited production to stabilize prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Under Ernst Oppenheimer's leadership, [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control | De Beers]] established the Central Selling Organization (CSO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The CSO bought all raw production from other producers at a fixed, profitable price and then resold diamonds in controlled "sites" to jewelry cutting factories called "site holders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Site holders were not allowed to negotiate prices, had to buy the entire box, and could not resell rough diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

The CSO also controlled marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In 1938, Harry Oppenheimer, Ernst's son, worked with N.W. Ayer of New York to launch a campaign tying diamonds to romance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This campaign used influencer and content marketing, giving movie stars diamonds, planting news articles about celebrities acquiring diamonds, and famously coining the slogan "A diamond is forever" in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This marketing succeeded, making diamonds the pinnacle of luxury and a wedding fixture, perceived as a unique gemstone only the Earth could make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Early Attempts at [[technological_advancements_in_diamond_synthesis_methods | Diamond Synthesis]]

For centuries, people desired to make their own diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. In 1797, Smithson Tennant demonstrated that diamonds are a form of carbon by burning one in oxygen to produce carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Recognizing diamonds' density compared to other carbon forms, early attempts focused on subjecting carbon to high pressure and heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Famous scientists like James Hannay and Nobel laureate Ferdinand Frederick Henri Moissan claimed success in the late 1800s, but their results could not be replicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The technology of their era was insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

A more scientific approach was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. In 1915, Gilbert Lewis and Merle Randall showed that at 10,000 atmospheres, diamond and graphite were in equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Researchers mapped out the conditions under which carbon forms, determining that to manifest as diamond, carbon requires not only 2,000 degrees Celsius but also over a million pounds per square inch of pressure, possibly less with a metal catalyst or solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## High-Pressure, High-Temperature (HPHT) Method

### ASEA's Breakthrough (1953)
In February 1953, researchers at the General Swedish Electrical Limited Company (ASEA) produced the first [[technological_advancements_in_diamond_synthesis_methods | synthetic diamond]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. They used a device with a sealed hollow cube core surrounded by six anvils, applying hydraulic force to generate pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Heat was added by igniting thermite with an electric filament, heating an inner core of graphite to 2,000 degrees Celsius for about 1.5 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Initial failures led them to add iron as a solvent inside the core, inserting a mixture of cementite and graphite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. To mitigate explosion risk, the core was wrapped in Platinum and tantalum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This process, subjecting the material to 80,000 bar (1.2 million pounds per square inch) and 2,000 degrees Celsius, yielded small diamond crystals, about 0.1 millimeters across <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. ASEA did not immediately publicize or patent their work, as lawyers advised that only the equipment, not the diamonds themselves, could be patented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### General Electric's Contribution
In 1951, General Electric (GE) formed a group to produce [[technological_advancements_in_diamond_synthesis_methods | synthetic diamonds]], driven by supply chain concerns as they were the world's largest diamond consumer, using 100 million carats (20 tons) of grit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Collaborating with physicist P.W. Bridgman, GE modified his designs to create a "belt apparatus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This device, with two cone-shaped anvils pressing on a small pressure chamber, could exert three million pounds per square inch at 3,400 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. At these extreme conditions, no additional solvent or catalyst was needed; graphite directly transformed into diamond, resulting in small crystals about one millimeter wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

News of GE's success briefly threatened consumer belief in the uniqueness of their expensive [[comparison_of_synthetic_and_natural_diamonds_in_the_jewelry_industry | gemstone diamonds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. However, it soon became clear that these initial [[technological_advancements_in_diamond_synthesis_methods | synthetic diamonds]] were very small (about one millimeter wide), posing no threat to [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control | De Beers]], which dealt in larger diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Researchers later found that using a small seed diamond and closely controlling heat and pressure could grow them as large as three carats, but these were dark, low-quality, and had an "onion-like" structure, making them more suitable for industrial grit than jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

It wasn't until 1970 that scientists could create a large, [[comparison_of_synthetic_and_natural_diamonds_in_the_jewelry_industry | gem-quality crystal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The key was a long growth time, taking about a week to grow a one-carat diamond (five millimeters across); speeding up the process caused flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. This long "cook time" was economically infeasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Additionally, these crystals were usually yellow and distinguishable from their [[comparison_of_synthetic_and_natural_diamonds_in_the_jewelry_industry | natural peers]] using ultraviolet fluorescence or absorption spectroscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Thus, the HPHT method, while costly, had serious limitations for jewelry-grade diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) Method

Researchers then explored growing diamonds in a low-pressure environment without expensive equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. From 1952 to 1953, William Eversole of Union Carbide company experimented with heating carbon-containing gas in the presence of a seed diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Carbon atoms from the gas attached to the diamond surface, adding mass without high pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. This method, Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), is heavily used in the [[recent_trends_and_future_directions_in_semiconductor_materials | semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

Eversole's work was largely forgotten as the industry favored GE's HPHT method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. However, in 1963, Dr. John Angus of Case Western Reserve University replicated and continued Eversole's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. The key to successfully growing pure [[comparison_of_synthetic_and_natural_diamonds_in_the_jewelry_industry | gem quality]] diamonds with CVD was atomic hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. In the CVD process, not all carbon attaches as diamond; a significant portion forms graphite impurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Originally, Angus's team used alternating growth and cleaning cycles, etching off graphite with sulfuric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. A PhD student suggested using an atomic hydrogen stream from a Tungsten filament for cleaning, which performed much better and allowed both growth and cleaning in the same chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

In 1971, Angus mentioned his use of atomic hydrogen at an academic meeting in the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. A Soviet team then pioneered a second critical breakthrough: using atomic hydrogen not only during cleaning but also during the growth phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This suppressed graphite formation and turned any formed graphite into gas, carrying it away from the diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Their findings attracted the attention of a team at Japan's National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This Japanese team used a hot filament or microwaves to activate a mix of hydrogen and methane, accelerating growth to a few micrometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

## Market Impact and [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control | De Beers]]' Response

The CVD industry gradually overcame its limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. By the 1990s, it could make single-crystal [[technological_advancements_in_diamond_synthesis_methods | synthetic diamonds]] in various colors, and these [[comparison_of_synthetic_and_natural_diamonds_in_the_jewelry_industry | gem quality]] synthetics began appearing in the jewelry market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

In response, [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control | De Beers]] invested in new detection methods, including UV fluorescence, X-rays, and advanced spectroscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. While this worked for a time, synthetics rapidly eliminated this weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Now, such gems can only be identified in a lab with very advanced tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

This technical improvement coincided with massive changes in the diamond industry during the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Japan's rise as a luxury jewelry market in the late 1980s boosted the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. However, the fall of the Soviet Union and new deposits in Australia introduced new competitors, breaking apart the old cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. Lev Leviev, a former [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control | De Beers]] customer, purchased diamond factories and struck agreements with Russia's new monopoly, Alrosa, creating one of the first truly independent competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Additionally, Australian mining giant BHP, possessing the Argyle diamond mine, stayed out of the cartel, taking market share from [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control | De Beers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

By the turn of the century, despite retaining formidable market share (marketing and selling 80% of global output while mining only 25-40% itself) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>, [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control | De Beers]] acknowledged it no longer controlled the entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. In 2000, [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control | De Beers]] restructured into a more traditional luxury company, shifting marketing to promote its affiliated dealers and partnering with Louis Vuitton to open branded retail ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

In 2020, [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control | De Beers]] announced it would start producing and selling its own [[technological_advancements_in_diamond_synthesis_methods | synthetics]], leaning into the synthetic diamond industry's technological advances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This mirrors the market transition of pearls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Natural pearls, once harvested from the wild, were largely replaced after Japan pioneered cultured pearl farming in the 1910s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Consumers preferred cultured pearls for their rounder, more consistent look, and environmental friendliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Today, virtually every pearl in a jewelry shop is cultured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

Similarly, modern [[comparison_of_synthetic_and_natural_diamonds_in_the_jewelry_industry | gem-quality]] CVD [[technological_advancements_in_diamond_synthesis_methods | synthetic diamonds]] are becoming increasingly desirable, often described as more beautiful, ideal-looking, better for the environment, produced with less worker exploitation, and far cheaper than any [[comparison_of_synthetic_and_natural_diamonds_in_the_jewelry_industry | natural diamond]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. In essence, [[technological_advancements_in_diamond_synthesis_methods | synthetic diamonds]] are disrupting the diamond market, not by making diamonds cheaper as many initially expected, but by shifting the value from the stone's inherent scarcity to the scarcity of a luxury brand like [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control | De Beers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

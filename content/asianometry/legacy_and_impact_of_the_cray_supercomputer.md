The [[history_and_evolution_of_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray Supercomputer]] series represents a lifelong quest by computer designer [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Seymour Cray]] to build the world's biggest and fastest computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. His singular focus was "to take it to the limit" in supercomputing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Beginnings in Supercomputing
[[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Seymour Cray]] Jr. was born in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, in 1925 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. After serving as an electrician in the army, he pursued degrees in electrical engineering and applied math from the University of Minnesota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. In 1950, he joined Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in St. Paul, Minnesota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

ERA was established by the US Navy after World War II to retain elite code-breakers for work on [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | Soviet codes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The company quickly moved from dedicated code-breaking machines to general-purpose computers, leveraging [[technological_innovations_and_challenges_in_supercomputer_design | emerging technologies]] like magnetic drum memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Minnesota, with its strong military presence, became America's premier computing center in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

At ERA, [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Cray]], despite being only 25, proved to be a brilliant and focused worker with a gift for understanding binary numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. He designed the control system for the ERA 1103, demonstrating a deep understanding of computer architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Control Data Corporation (CDC)
In 1951, ERA was sold to Remington Rand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, which later merged with Sperry Corporation to form Sperry Rand in 1955 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Tensions arose between the ERA team (focused on scientific computing) and the Eckertâ€“Mauchly Computer Corporation (focused on business computing), which Remington Rand had also acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. In 1957, William Norris, VP of Operations at ERA, left Sperry Rand to found Control Data Corporation (CDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Seymour Cray]] joined him, having noticed his project categorized as "999 Miscellaneous and Other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

CDC started with no plant, product, or much money, relying on an IPO where shares were sold for a dollar each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Many prominent investors declined, including Warren Buffett, who was [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Norris]]'s nephew by marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The early CDC IPO later enriched its initial investors and created new wealth in Minnesota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## The CDC 1604: A Commercial Supercomputer
As the most technical person at CDC, [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Cray]] persuaded co-founders to build scientific computers, targeting universities and nuclear weapons research labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. These customers prioritized raw compute power for complex calculations, such as simulating nuclear detonations, over marketing or client service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This focus on high-performance computing for specialized applications would become a hallmark of [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Cray]]'s career and the [[history_and_evolution_of_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray Supercomputer]]'s legacy.

[[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Cray]] believed he could build a powerful computer affordably using transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. He famously used reject bipolar transistors, pairing them in a Darlington pair to amplify weak signals, proving that a clever design could compensate for substandard components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

In 1958, CDC struck a deal with the US Navy for the CDC 1604 computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Released in 1960, the CDC 1604, priced at $990,000 (about $10.4 million today), was the most powerful commercially-available computer at 0.2 megahertz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. It marked CDC's entry into the "supercomputer" market, a term that describes computers pushing the envelope in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. While other companies like UNIVAC and IBM also built powerful machines (LARC, STRETCH), these were often made-to-order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. CDC, with the 1604, turned the supercomputer into a commercially successful category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, selling to various institutions and challenging older computer giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### The CDC 6600: A New Paradigm of Speed
[[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Cray]]'s singular drive to build the fastest machine led to a split within CDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. He threatened to leave if he couldn't focus on his next project, the CDC 6600, a machine designed to be 15 times faster than the 1604 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Cray]] and his team moved to Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, to work on the 6600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

The CDC 6600 incorporated several [[technological_innovations_and_challenges_in_supercomputer_design | innovations]]:
*   **Silicon Planar Transistors:** Switched from germanium to faster silicon transistors, providing an immediate 5x speed boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.
*   **Dense Custom Modules ("Cordwood Modules"):** Replaced extensive back panel wiring with shorter wires to improve speed, requiring freon gas cooling instead of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   **Parallelism:** Included 11 individual computers, ten handling secondary tasks (peripherals) and one dedicated to high-speed math, offloading "housekeeping functions" from the main processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Simplified Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):** Ditching instructions unrelated to scientific computing allowed for "pipelining" tasks, breaking down jobs into smaller ones for simultaneous processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

Delivered in 1964, the CDC 6600 was three times faster than IBM's 7030 STRETCH supercomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. IBM's chairman, Thomas J. Watson Jr., famously questioned how [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Cray]]'s small team beat the industry giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. The answer lay in [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Cray]]'s willingness to sacrifice compatibility for raw speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Over a hundred CDC 6600s were sold, despite costing $8 million each, primarily to defense and research customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

### The [[history_and_evolution_of_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray-1]]: Icon of Vector Processing
By 1972, internal tensions at CDC and pressure to cut expenses led [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Cray]] to leave and found Cray Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. The company's goal was to build the biggest computer, one at a time, like a master artisan, focusing on research over mass manufacture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

For his first machine, the [[history_and_evolution_of_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray-1]], [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Seymour Cray]] introduced **vector processing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. Unlike scalar processors that handle single data items sequentially, vector processors could operate on single-dimension arrays of data (vectors) with a single instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. This drastically reduced the number of instructions needed for large datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Cray]] learned from the failures of CDC's STAR-100 vector computer, addressing bottlenecks by improving scalar processing speed and introducing "vector registers" as fast intermediate memory systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

The [[history_and_evolution_of_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray-1]] also adopted integrated circuits (ICs) for increased density and reduced wiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, and used bipolar semiconductor memory chips for speed and density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. With a clock cycle of 12.5 nanoseconds, it was five times faster than the CDC 7600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. Its iconic circular shape accommodated a new freon cooling scheme and differentiated it from other computers of the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

Upon its 1976 release, the [[history_and_evolution_of_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray-1]] created a huge stir due to its flashy look and world-beating speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. One hundred units were sold to government and university labs, generating significant revenue growth for Cray Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. IBM didn't even try to compete, and Control Data Corporation, once a leader in supercomputing, struggled to keep up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

## Evolution and Challenges
The success of the [[history_and_evolution_of_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray-1]] led to new challenges. [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Cray]] wanted to move to the even more ambitious Cray-2, but customers increasingly desired portability and iteration on existing designs rather than radically new architectures that required software rewrites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. This echoed the dilemma [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Cray]] faced at CDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

Cray Research adopted a dual approach: extending the [[history_and_evolution_of_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray-1]] line with models like the 1S, while [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Seymour Cray]] became an independent contractor in Boulder, Colorado, to work on the Cray-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. The Cray-2, released in 1985, famously featured a massive liquid immersion cooling system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.

However, the Cray-2 was upstaged by the **Cray X-MP supercomputer**, developed by a separate team led by Les Davis and Steve Chen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. Released in 1983, the X-MP introduced **parallel processing** with four CPUs and solid-state storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. It was 2-5 times faster than the 1S without the radical design changes of the Cray-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. The X-MP and its successor, the Y-MP, sold almost 200 units, significantly more than the 24 units of the Cray-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

### New Pressures and [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Cray]]'s Departure
By the 1980s, new competitors emerged, including Japanese companies like Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC, leveraging advancements in VLSI semiconductor production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. Supercomputer startups like Thinking Machines and nCUBE began exploring Massively Parallel Systems (MPPs), which used many commercial microprocessors for a better price-performance ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. This increased competition put pressure on Cray Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.

In 1989, [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Seymour Cray]] left Cray Research to join a spinoff, Cray Computer Corporation (CCC), to work on the Cray-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. The Cray-3 aimed to use gallium arsenide semiconductors for even faster switching performance, but faced delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. The decline in defense demand after the fall of the [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | Soviet Union]] led to order cancellations, and CCC filed for bankruptcy in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. The Cray-4 never materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>. [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Cray]]'s preferred "clean sheet of paper" approach to "big iron" supercomputers was no longer financially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.

[[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Seymour Cray]] then formed SRC Computers to explore parallel designs, but he passed away in 1996 from a car accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. Cray Research was eventually acquired by Silicon Graphics and is now part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as Cray Inc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.

## Conclusion: Enduring Legacy
The [[history_and_evolution_of_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray Supercomputer]]'s legacy is immense. [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Seymour Cray]] and his machines consistently pushed the boundaries of computing performance. His focus on scientific computing and [[technological_innovations_and_challenges_in_supercomputer_design | innovations]] like vector processing and parallelism laid foundational groundwork for modern high-performance computing.

Despite the supercomputers of the past appearing comically slow today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a> (a Cray-1A could be emulated on a small development board in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>), the challenges [[seymour_crays_career_and_contributions_to_supercomputing | Cray]] faced with his designs â€” thermal problems, interconnect issues, and memory retrieval slowdowns â€” are still present in today's leading-edge semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. The [[history_and_evolution_of_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray Supercomputer]] stands as a testament to the relentless pursuit of computational power and its profound impact on scientific research, engineering, and the very architecture of computing.

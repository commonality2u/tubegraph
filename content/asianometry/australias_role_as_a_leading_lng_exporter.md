From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Australia is recognized as the world's leading exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), having exported $25 billion worth of natural gas to Asian markets in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This status highlights the country's vast natural resources, but also reflects its complex energy politics and sprawling size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Despite its export prominence, Australia occasionally faces [[challenges_of_domestic_natural_gas_shortages_in_australia | natural gas shortages]] in its own domestic markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Natural Gas Reserves

Australia possesses significant proven natural gas reserves, estimated at approximately 3 trillion cubic meters in conventional reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. When unconventional gas fields, such as coal seam gas and shale gas, are included, the total reserves could be as high as 12 trillion cubic meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. However, much of this gas is unevenly distributed, with almost 80% of conventional gas resources concentrated in the country's northwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Historical Context of Energy Production

For most of its history, Australia primarily exported coal and reserved natural gas for domestic use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Australians have mined coal since the 1800s and began exporting it after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Today, Australia is the world's second-largest coal exporter, trailing only Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

When Australia's first commercial gas field became operational in the 1960s, natural gas was valued as a premium fuel due to its low pollutant characteristics compared to coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. It began to be used for electricity generation and industrial purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Understanding Natural Gas

Natural gas is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons and non-hydrocarbons, predominantly methane, along with hexane, ethane, propane, butane, and hydrogen sulfide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It is odorless, colorless, and lighter than air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Scientists believe it forms from organic matter trapped in sediment deposits over millions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

Geologists classify natural gas fields into two main categories:
*   **Conventional gas**: Free gas trapped in porous reservoir rocks like carbonates, sandstones, and salt stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Unconventional gas**: An umbrella term for other types, often found during searches for other fossil fuels and more challenging to extract. This includes shale gas (trapped in tiny pores within shale rock) and coal seam gas (absorbed and trapped in coal deposits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Challenges of Natural Gas Transportation

One significant challenge with natural gas is its transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Reserves are often far from population centers, necessitating safe and reliable transport methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

*   **Pipelines**: Convenient and economical for shorter distances, but lack flexibility and can be politically controversial for intercontinental projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)**: For longer distances (beyond 700 miles overseas or 2,200 miles on land), LNG is more economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Natural gas is cooled to -260°F (-162°C) to condense into a liquid, reducing its volume by 1/600th, making it easier to transport in tanker ships or trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The main drawback is the need for expensive liquefaction plants, which represent a significant upfront cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Australia's Non-Integrated Pipeline System

Critically, Australia, despite its vast size, lacks an integrated nationwide gas pipeline system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Its 47,000-kilometer network is divided into three largely separate subsystems: the northern, western, and eastern markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Each market relies on its own local gas fields and pipeline systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This patchwork system, due to physical distance and varying regulatory regimes, contributes to a significant national energy security problem, preventing gas from being moved from areas of abundance to areas of urgent need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## The Path to LNG Export Leadership

### Early Export Embargo

In the 1960s and 1970s, as new natural gas fields were discovered, foreign interest in Australian reserves grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This led to feelings of economic nationalism, and in 1970, Australia's federal government imposed a general export embargo on LNG to ensure domestic requirements were met first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### The Northwest Shelf Venture

The **Northwest Shelf Venture** began as a joint venture involving Australian companies (like Woodside Petroleum) and foreign multinationals (Burma Oil, Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, California Asiatic Oil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. After years of exploration, major natural gas discoveries were made in 1971 at Scott Reef, and later at North Rankin and Goodwin, off the coast of Western Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. These fields were estimated to hold over 300 billion cubic meters of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

These discoveries far exceeded Western Australia's domestic needs, prompting the venture to plan a massive $12 billion project to develop resources, build an LNG plant, and export LNG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. However, the nationwide export ban remained in effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The left-wing federal government, wary of foreign involvement, also requested at least 50% local ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

The project faced [[transportation_and_infrastructure_issues_related_to_natural_gas_in_australia | economic gridlock]]: the Western Australian market was too small to justify the multi-billion dollar investment, and the lack of an integrated national pipeline system meant gas could not be economically transported to the larger eastern markets (e.g., Dampier to Sydney is 3,202 miles, longer than Los Angeles to New York City) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The Whitlam federal government proposed building a national pipeline grid in 1973, but this project faced substantial political and environmental challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Policy Shift and Export Commencement

In 1975, a more business-friendly, right-leaning government came to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Obstacles began to fall:
*   The local ownership threshold was naturally met when Burma Oil sold its stake to the Australian mining giant BHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   In 1977, the federal government lifted its export embargo, allowing the Northwest Shelf Venture to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The policy allowed for "reasonable quantities of gas" to be exported, provided domestic requirements were considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Initially, 50% of production was allowed for export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   Tax benefits were introduced, including an extended investment allowance, an income tax rebate, and waived oil and resource taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

In 1978, the venture secured deals with eight large Japanese customers, buoyed by favorable oil market conditions following the Iranian Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Construction began in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

The Northwest Shelf Venture was Australia's largest project to date and, for a time, the world's single biggest engineering project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. It involved offshore platforms, undersea pipelines, a massive LNG plant (processing 12 million tons annually), LNG tankers, and a pipeline to Perth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Over 75% of materials, excluding tankers, were locally sourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

The first LNG exports to Japan began in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Japan and the People's Republic of China together purchase 75% of Australia's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Today, Western Australia's gas fields still account for about 80% of the country's proven reserves, with over $25 billion invested in projects, including the Gorgon gas project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. The Northwest Shelf project requires reserving a significant portion of production for domestic use, with natural gas providing 64% of Western Australia's energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Domestic Energy Challenges and Unconventional Gas Development

Despite its export success, Australia's northern and eastern markets face significant supply challenges, particularly the eastern market which serves major cities like Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Hobart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Australia's domestic energy demand is growing rapidly, with consumption increasing by about 0.6% annually, driven by industrial demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Australia ranks 19th globally in electricity consumption per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

Australia's energy mix has shifted towards renewables, with wind and solar energy contributions surging from 2% in 2010 to 18% in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. This growth has primarily taken market share from coal (falling from 81% to 67%) and, to a lesser extent, natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

The growing domestic demand incentivized the development of unconventional natural gas, particularly **coal seam gas (CSG)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. While the southern and eastern regions lack conventional gas fields, they possess extensive coal deposits with large methane reserves absorbed within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Historically, this methane, a workplace hazard, was vented into the atmosphere, which is wasteful and polluting given methane's high global warming potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

After decades of efforts by companies like Conoco Australia, Mitsubishi, and Houston Oil and Minerals, BHP achieved a breakthrough in 1996 at the Bowen Basin in Queensland, sparking a coal seam gas boom in eastern Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. Gas production grew ninefold due to domestic eastern market growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. State governments further supported this by pushing for a switch from coal to gas, exemplified by the Queensland Gas Scheme in 2005, which mandated electricity retailers to produce 13-15% of their electricity from gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

The Bowen Basin's vast coal seam reserves can supply eastern markets for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. However, export markets again became attractive. The Queensland state government approved three consortia to build LNG plants and export coal seam gas to Asian markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. The first plant (operated by Santos) came online in December 2014, followed by others, resulting in three LNG plants on Curtis Island capable of producing 26 million tons of LNG annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Eastern Australia's proximity to Asia offers a price advantage for its LNG exports, despite higher labor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

## Australia's Global Standing and Future Outlook

In 2020, Australia surpassed Qatar to become the world's leading exporter of liquefied natural gas, with the two countries remaining neck and neck for the top spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Australia's rise as an LNG power, combined with its reputation as a reliably Western-aligned country, has significantly helped stabilize global energy markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

Despite this international success, Australia's domestic markets continue to face [[challenges_of_domestic_natural_gas_shortages_in_australia | significant energy shortages]] and rising prices, which impede growth and create political difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Various ideas, such as a transcontinental pipeline or a nationwide gas reservation policy, are being discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Addressing Australia's natural gas dilemma requires incorporating these ideas into a coherent nationwide strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

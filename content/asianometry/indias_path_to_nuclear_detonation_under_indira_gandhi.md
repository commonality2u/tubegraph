India became the sixth declared nuclear power on May 18, 1974, at 8:05 AM local time, despite being one of the first countries to advocate for a global ban on nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Mahatma Gandhi had stated in 1947 that nuclear weapons represented a "sinful and diabolical use of science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, and [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Jawaharlal Nehru]], India's first Prime Minister, voiced concerns that the atomic bomb would primarily be a weapon for killing Asians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While India initially desired a world without nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, its journey to the atomic bomb was complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Foundation of the Atomic Program

India's atomic program began with [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Dr. Homi Bhabha]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Born into a prominent Parsi family, his uncle by marriage was Sir Dorabji Tata, son of Tata Group founder Jamshedji Tata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Bhabha]] earned a PhD in physics from Cambridge, specializing in cosmic rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. He was stranded in India during a holiday in 1939 when World War II broke out in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Initially viewing his stay as a temporary disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Bhabha]] saw an opportunity to make a transformative impact as India approached independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. In 1944, he sought funds from the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust to establish a "vigorous school of research" for world-class science in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This led to the founding of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. TIFR, funded with a lavish budget, became the foundation of Indiaâ€™s atomic energy program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Atomic Energy Commission of India
In 1948, [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] proposed the creation of the [[criticism_and_challenges_faced_by_indias_atomic_energy_commission | Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) of India, with [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Bhabha]] as its chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The AEC enjoyed substantial government protection, with [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Bhabha]] reporting directly to the Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] was primarily interested in nuclear science for its potential to accelerate India's development and prestige, especially for energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. While publicly opposing nuclear weapons, [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] understood global realities and allowed [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Bhabha]] the autonomy to build the necessary infrastructure for a weapon if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Strategic Materials and International Partnerships
India possesses abundant thorium, which is non-fissile but can be converted into fissile uranium-233 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Early efforts focused on acquiring and controlling thorium, particularly from the Travancore principality, which held India's only known source of nuclear ore at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The Indian government eventually pressured Travancore to join the union, securing its nuclear ores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

India also leveraged its strategic minerals for international partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Agreements were made with France for a monazite processing plant and joint research on beryllium-moderated reactors, marking the first bilateral international nuclear project after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Bhabha]] also proposed a trade with the American AEC in 1952, offering thorium or uranium ore in exchange for declassified reactor information and heavy water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

Despite strained relations due to India's non-alignment policy, the global demand for strategic nuclear ores brought the Americans to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Concerns about India deepening ties with the [[development_of_the_hydrogen_bomb_by_the_soviet_union | Soviets]], especially after the [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_chinas_nuclear_program | Chinese Civil War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, also influenced American engagement.

## Atoms for Peace and Reactor Acquisition
In December 1953, Dwight Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" speech at the UN shifted global nuclear policy, opening doors to commercial competition and technology transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This initiative, aimed at promoting peaceful uses of atomic energy and dispelling the taboo around nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, inadvertently downplayed non-proliferation dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. India's atomic program greatly benefited from this duality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

In 1954, [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Bhabha]] presented a three-step plan to address criticisms and show results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>:
1.  Build natural uranium-fueled reactors (with foreign help) producing plutonium as a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
2.  Build new reactors fueled by thorium and plutonium from the first stage, producing uranium-233 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
3.  Use uranium-233 and India's thorium in "breeder" reactors for an unlimited nuclear fuel supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
This plan, designed for national independence and strategic optionality, leveraged India's thorium reserves and provided the option to build nuclear weapons through plutonium production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] supported this plan, significantly increasing the program's budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

### Acquiring Reactors
*   **Apsara (UK)**: In 1954, [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Bhabha]] secured technical drawings and 6 kilograms of enriched fuel rods from the UK for a "swimming pool" type research reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Named "Apsara", this 1-megawatt reactor became Asia's first nuclear reactor outside the [[development_of_the_hydrogen_bomb_by_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] when it went live in August 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] proudly noted at its inauguration in January 1957 that it was "almost entirely" the work of young Indian scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

*   **CIRUS (Canada/US)**: At the 1955 Atoms for Peace conference, Canada proposed transferring one of their research reactors to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. This led to the Canadian-Indian Reactor, US (CIRUS), a 40-megawatt heavy water reactor, with Canada covering foreign exchange costs and the United States providing 21 tons of heavy water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Bhabha]] rejected international custody of the fuel, asserting India's "inalienable right" and morally criticizing atomic "haves" and "have-nots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. CIRUS began operations in 1956, went critical in 1960, and reached full capacity in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

CIRUS's design encouraged the production of weapons-grade plutonium, as it allowed for the removal and replacement of uranium fuel rods while operational to prevent the creation of undesirable plutonium isotopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

### Plutonium Reprocessing
Concurrently, India built a plutonium reprocessing plant called Phoenix in Trombay, which could extract plutonium from spent nuclear fuel like that from CIRUS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. The plant was indigenously built with legitimate plans transferred from Vitro International, an American company involved in the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. By 1962, India technically had a pathway to a nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. The Phoenix plant went live in June 1964, meaning India was about a year away from having enough weapons-grade plutonium for a test bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

## The Hesitancy and Geopolitical Shifts
Despite having the materials by 1965, India's leaders, including [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]], were initially against pursuing a nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. The Sino-Indian War of 1962, which resulted in a humiliating loss for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>, motivated India to improve its defense capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. Following this, the right-wing Jana Sangh Party, an ancestor of today's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, publicly advocated for India to build the bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

However, [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] maintained a non-bomb policy, stating it would contradict India's advocacy against nuclear tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. He passed away in May 1964, still believing atomic bombs wouldn't aid India's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

### The [[chinas_first_nuclear_bomb_test | Chinese Nuclear Bomb Test]]
Lal Bahadur Shastri took over as Prime Minister in June 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. On September 29, 1964, the US announced an imminent [[chinas_first_nuclear_bomb_test | Chinese nuclear weapons test]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Dr. Bhabha]] publicly claimed India was 18 months away from a nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. On October 16, [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_chinas_nuclear_program | China]] detonated its bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>, deeply impacting the Indian political class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. The Jana Sangh party escalated its rhetoric for a bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.

An "Indian Express" survey of elites in late October showed belief in [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Bhabha]]'s timeline but urged caution due to high costs amidst inflation and food shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Bhabha]], in a UN speech, had downplayed costs, stating 50 atomic bombs would cost $21 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. Many disputed the relevance of [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_chinas_nuclear_program | China]]'s bomb to India, citing Mao's "paper tiger" quote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>. Shastri prioritized solving the food shortage crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>, but advocated for nuclear weapons for "peaceful purposes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

### The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965
The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>, during which [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_chinas_nuclear_program | China]] threatened India with nuclear retaliation (though [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_chinas_nuclear_program | China]] blinked) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>, along with the US halting military exports to both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>, obliterated trust in a Western nuclear umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. This reignited calls within India for building a bomb, believing India could only depend on itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.

## Indira Gandhi's Leadership and the Explosion
In January 1966, Shastri died, and Indira Gandhi, [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]]'s daughter, became Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. On the same day, [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Bhabha]] passed away in a plane crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>, leaving a massive void in India's nuclear policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

Gandhi appointed Vikram Sarabhai to take over several of [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Bhabha]]'s posts, including Secretary of the Department of Atomic Energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>. By 1966, the world presumed an Indian nuclear weapon was imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. It is likely that Shastri and [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Bhabha]] had already initiated a peaceful nuclear explosion program in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

In 1968, scientists at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) began work on a practical implosion-type plutonium bomb design, initiated by the [[criticism_and_challenges_faced_by_indias_atomic_energy_commission | AEC]]'s new chairperson, Homi Sethna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>. A team of 50-70 scientists, led by R. Chidambaram, worked on the design and sourced components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. Sarabhai, Sethna's boss, disliked nuclear weapons and advocated for nuclear reactor expansion, but did not stop the bomb effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. Sarabhai's death in December 1971 removed the last major political obstacle to a nuclear explosion test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.

### The Detonation
The nuclear bomb's basic design was completed at the end of 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. In January 1972, BARC technical teams began preliminary work on assembling the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. In September 1972, Homi Sethna received formal approval from Indira Gandhi to finalize the device and find a test site for a potential underground peaceful nuclear explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>.

In March 1973, a key milestone was achieved when the detonation system confirmed an implosion was possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>. The Thar desert in Rajasthan was chosen as the test site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>. In May 1973, the Indian Army's 61 Engineer Regiment was ordered to dig an underground shaft for a "seismic experiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. After initial refusal, they complied when Chief of Army staff G. G. Bewoor personally conveyed Prime Minister Gandhi's order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. A new site had to be found and dug after an aquifer was accidentally hit in January 1974, delaying the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.

On May 18, 1974, after a heated discussion, Gandhi made the final decision to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. The explosion, originally scheduled for 8 AM, was delayed by five minutes due to a faulty Jeep engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. [[criticism_and_challenges_faced_by_indias_atomic_energy_commission | Dr. Sethna]], who was present, recalled a "sense of relief" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.

### Indira Gandhi's Role and Motivations
Indira Gandhi took the final step to the detonation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. While she was an inscrutable person, Raja Ramanna, who led the technical team, noted she "listened and then decided" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>. Gandhi stated that the "Peaceful Nuclear Explosion" was simply done when the scientists were ready, denying political motives like upcoming elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. India did not conduct another detonation immediately, nor did it pursue a full-scale weapons program with bombers and missiles at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.

However, several circumstances suggest other motivations:
*   **US-India Relations (1971 War)**: During the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War, US President Nixon ordered the nuclear-powered USS Enterprise to enter the Bay of Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. Indian government members, including Gandhi, perceived this as nuclear intimidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>, which could have prompted the decision to proceed with the test, as momentum towards the detonation began in early 1972 after the carrier's arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.
*   **US-China Rapprochement**: Nixon's overtures to [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_chinas_nuclear_program | China]], culminating in his 1972 visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>, likely made India uneasy about improving US-[[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_chinas_nuclear_program | China]] relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>.
*   **Domestic Politics**: Despite Gandhi's claims, the detonation was highly popular in India and consolidated her political power amidst rising opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.

## Conclusion
Regardless of the precise reasoning, the 1974 Indian nuclear explosion had significant effects on non-proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>. India was the first country to use civilian nuclear energy technology to create a bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>. This led to new international efforts to control nuclear technology to prevent similar occurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. The immense international backlash, especially from Canada, surprised Indian scientists and the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. Consequently, India did not conduct a second peaceful nuclear explosion and only began producing actual nuclear weapons two decades later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. Nevertheless, India asserted its right to the Bomb, a stance that remained unwavering throughout its program's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

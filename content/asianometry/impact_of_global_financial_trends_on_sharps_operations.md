The [[rise_and_decline_of_japans_sharp_corporation | decline of Sharp Corporation]] was significantly influenced by global financial trends and intense market competition, particularly starting at the turn of the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Economic Weakness and Declining Profits (1990s)

Following the unraveling of Japan's real estate bubble, the nation's domestic economy weakened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. This period was characterized by a strong Yen, increasing wages, and the effects of manufacturing offshoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. These shifts fundamentally changed the direction of Japan's major electronic firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

[[sharps_iconic_products_and_market_competition | Cheap foreign imports]] began to challenge Sharp's traditional product lines, such as fax machines, calculators, and microwave ovens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Despite launching new, more advanced products, some like the Viewcam camcorder were hits, while others like the Wizard electronic organizer never gained traction, and saturated markets like notebook PCs failed to generate sufficient profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

Consequently, profits for Sharp declined throughout the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. In 1998, net income plummeted to 24.8 billion yen, representing a mere 1.4% profit margin and nearly a 50% year-over-year decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. This poor financial performance led to the resignation of Sharp's president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

## Risky LCD Investments and Market Oversupply

Sharp's one bright spot was its LCD panels and related products, which accounted for 30% of company revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Under new president Katsuhiko Machida in 1998, Sharp decided to reposition its [[innovation_and_challenges_in_sharps_lcd_business | LCD business]] at the core of its strategy, even ditching its long-standing CRT television business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

Sharp's pivot towards displays was risky due to intense competition emerging from the rest of Asia, particularly Taiwan and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. To maintain its lead against competitors like Samsung, Sharp invested billions of yen into new TFT LCD factories across Japan, most notably the Kamiyama plant, which cost a cumulative 4 billion USD and was the world's biggest at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

These massive investments, however, strained the company's finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. Sharp even waived its long-standing financial rule that restricted any single division's investment to a certain percentage of its sales, operating income, and cash flow due to the perceived importance of LCDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

### Price Erosion from Oversupply
Unfortunately, the Kamiyama plant came online concurrently with other huge facilities built by competitors like AU Optronics, Sony, Samsung, and LG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. This led to an industry-wide situation of oversupply in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. The impact on pricing was drastic: a 32-inch TV panel that cost approximately $865 in 2004 would cost only about $149 by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

Sharp's TV market share plummeted from as high as 80% to under 10% throughout the 2000s, as the LCD television market rapidly became a cheap commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

## The Global Financial Crisis and Near Bankruptcy

In 2007, Sharp announced plans for new factories in Sakai, Osaka prefecture, projected to cost 3.4 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. While Sony initially agreed to a 33% ownership share in these factories, conflicts between Sharp's own TV and display panel divisions led to Sony eventually selling its entire stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

Then came the [[impact_of_the_global_financial_crisis_on_shipping | global financial crisis]] of 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. Sales collapsed, and losses surged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. In March 2009, Sharp reported a net loss for the first time since going public in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. Despite admitting mistakes in local production investment, management continued to focus on LCDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

By 2009, Sharp's TV market share was just 6-7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. The new 3 billion dollar Sakai plant's operating utilization fell to less than 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. The inability to balance the LCD panel supply and TV businesses resulted in losses in both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

By the fiscal year ending March 2012, Sharp's sales had declined by 10 billion dollars from 2008, and the company reported a net loss exceeding 5 billion dollars, pushing it to the brink of bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

## Foreign Takeover

In 2012, Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics giant, bought a 9.9% stake in Sharp for about 854 million dollars and a larger share in Sakai display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Foxconn's interest stemmed from its strategy to vertically integrate and expand its manufacturing supply chain, where the display is often the most expensive component in electronics gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

Despite Foxconn's initial offers for a more substantial partnership or acquisition, Sharp declined for several more loss-making years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. Sharp also missed several critical industry transitions, including the shift to LED-backlit LCD screens and OLED technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

In March 2013, Sharp announced another staggering 5 billion dollar loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. By 2013, Sharp, along with Fujitsu, began losing its dominant grip on the Japanese domestic smartphone market as Apple surged ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

Finally, in 2016, after three more difficult years, Sharp accepted Foxconn's offer to purchase a controlling 66% stake for 6.2 billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. Although Foxconn later revised the offer down to 3.8 billion dollars due to new financial liabilities, Sharp's bank creditors ultimately sided with Foxconn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

This acquisition marked the first foreign takeover of a leading Japanese electronics firm, a sad end for a venerable 100-year-old company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. Under Taiwanese management, Sharp turned a small profit in its first full year, with a reorientation towards branded electronics products and rebuilding its semiconductor manufacturing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

Sharp's downfall was largely attributed to its over-reliance on and deep investment in the LCD business, clinging to a perceived technological superiority in a brutal, low-margin, high-insecurity industry that ultimately "ground up Sharp too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

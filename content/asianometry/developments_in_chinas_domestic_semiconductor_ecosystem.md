In late August 2023, Huawei began selling its own phone chips again, with the Huawei Mate 60 Pro appearing in its online store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The phone features the Kirin 9000s (麒麟9000s), a 7-nanometer class chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Although Huawei did not officially state the manufacturer, it is widely believed to be SMIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Kirin 9000s Chip

The Kirin 9000s is a 107 square millimeter die, approximately 2% larger than Huawei's last leading-edge chips, the Kirin 9000 and Kirin 9000E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The Kirin 9000 was briefly produced using TSMC's 5-nanometer process until [[impact_of_export_bans_and_political_influence_on_chinese_semiconductor_industry | American sanctions]] ended that collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The new 7-nanometer class chip is about 5-6 years behind the current leading edge, with TSMC shipping 3-nanometer class chips in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Teardowns and speed tests suggest the Kirin 9000s supports 5G connectivity, though Huawei appears to be obscuring this fact, with press releases not mentioning 5G support and the phone's OS reporting 4G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The SoC's CPU core is a customization of Arm IP, and the GPU appears to be a new custom design by Huawei or HiSilicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This new GPU design initially caused texture errors in games like Genshin Impact, which are expected to be fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

Regarding yields, Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis suggests that SMIC’s early yields for this node are likely to be higher than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Yields typically start low but improve as the fabrication facility matures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The more phones Huawei sells, the faster SMIC can ramp up production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This 7nm chip is considered real and the node that produced it is described as "really, really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## The Manufacturing Process: SMIC's Role

The appearance of this chip was not entirely unexpected. Predictions had suggested a HiSilicon (Huawei) chip using SMIC's 7nm N+2 process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Nikkei Asia also reported in early August 2023 that SMIC was collaborating with Huawei on a new 5G chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

News of the SMIC N+2 process first emerged in July 2022, when it was used for Bitcoin miners, which are good test cases for node improvement due to their repetitive structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Producing a phone SOC like the Kirin 9000s is much more complex, and the success demonstrates the "tremendous [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | progress]]" achieved by Co-CEO Liang Mong-song and SMIC in about a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Capabilities and Lithography

Legendary TSMC R&D director Dr. Burn Lin stated in January 2022 that SMIC could fabricate even 5-nanometer class chips using only multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Immersion lithography, a technology 1-2 decades old, remains crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. While the United States banned EUV lithography exports, 193-nanometer immersion machines (like the Twinscan NXT 2000i) continue to perform 70-80% of the lithography work for leading fabs like Intel, TSMC, and Samsung, and potentially for the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

The US initially hesitated on a 193i ban, as Japan and the Netherlands were reluctant to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. It wasn't until June 30, 2023, that the Netherlands and Japan joined the US in imposing export restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. ASML, a key lithography equipment supplier, expressed dissatisfaction and aimed to sell all DUV immersion machines before the end of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This means SMIC still has access to these machines to ramp up 7-nanometer production and potentially move to 5-nanometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

As a result, a 5-nanometer class Huawei chip is anticipated within 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Emergence of a China-Only Supply Chain

The Mate 60 Pro showcases more than just an advanced chip; it is integrated into an ecosystem of domestic Chinese suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Bloomberg reported on the phone's many domestic suppliers, including for the radio frequency front-end module and the satellite communications modem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. With the exception of memory, which appears to be from SK Hynix, the entire phone is effectively a China-only ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

This establishes the groundwork for a complete, self-contained ecosystem within China to produce various domestic electronics, including smartphone SOCs, CPUs, edge AI NPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Implications for the Semiconductor Industry

While a phone chip on par with a five-year-old release might not seem revolutionary, it is expected to significantly impact companies like Qualcomm, Apple, and MediaTek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Ming-chi Kuo noted that Qualcomm sells tens of millions of chips to Huawei, sales that are likely to be replaced by the Kirin 9000s and similar domestic chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This will lead to business losses for non-Chinese semiconductor makers and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

SMIC is expected to be occupied fulfilling Huawei's orders for the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. However, there's an expectation that SMIC will seek new N+2 node customers in high-powered computing, potentially partnering to create a domestic AI accelerator (a Chinese version of Nvidia A100 or TPU) within 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. These could be designed by companies like Biren, Baidu, Alibaba Cloud, or Tencent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## China's Next Steps

China is actively building its native semiconductor and technology ecosystem, which is described as real and deserving praise, especially after facing sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

From a manufacturing perspective, the main goal should be wide distribution of the Mate 60 phone to maximize scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Selling millions more units, not just to Chinese consumers but also to Europeans, Australians, Southeast Asians, and Latin Americans, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Huawei is engaging in influencer marketing to help users install Google products on their phones, despite their default absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Every export sale weakens Western phone makers and strengthens SMIC, allowing them to raise yields, achieve profitability faster, and fund their move to 5 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

SMIC should also focus on reviewing and replicating advanced packaging technologies, such as chiplets and 2.5D die-stacking, which are essential for future advanced AI applications that prioritize data bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

Additionally, the Chinese Government will need to strengthen its domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment ecosystem, aiming to replace foreign suppliers like ASML, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, Lam Research, and metrology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## International Response and Export Controls

The US Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security justified October 7th restrictions on foreign support for advanced semiconductors (logic ICs at 16/14nm or below) due to concerns about their impact on military modernization, weapons of mass destruction, and human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. US intelligence indicates that China's ability to manufacture advanced logic chips has "significant implications for the regional military balance of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Given the [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | progress]] by SMIC and Huawei, if the US government believes a Chinese 7-nanometer node poses a national security threat, they may intensify efforts to stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. SMIC still relies on foreign equipment, as domestic suppliers are years behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Equipment companies like Applied, Lam Research, Tokyo Electron, and KLA can currently sell most of their tools, as tools for deposition, etch, metrology, and epitaxy used for 7nm and 5nm can also be plausibly used in 28nm processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. These tools are ostensibly sold for lagging-edge nodes but are likely being repurposed for chips like the Kirin 9000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

To prevent China from developing leading-edge capacity at scale, the US, in cooperation with allies like Japan, the Netherlands, and Germany, should consider tighter [[impact_of_export_bans_and_political_influence_on_chinese_semiconductor_industry | export controls]] on tools currently being repurposed, such as Argon Fluoride Immersion lithography, mask, and CMP equipment. Additionally, less liberal use of licenses for firms like SMIC on the entity list is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Kirin 9000s and the Mate 60 Pro represent a significant moment in [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | technology history]], akin to Samsung's shock to Japanese manufacturers in 1986 with its 1 megabit DRAM chip, which closed the gap from five years to one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Two years later, Samsung achieved parity with Japan with its 4 megabit chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. China is adopting a similar approach to semiconductor manufacturing as South Korea, which proved successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

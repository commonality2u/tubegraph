Recent reports from TechInsights and SemiAnalysis indicate that the Chinese semiconductor national champion, SMIC, has commenced producing chips using their own 7-nanometer (nm) process node, referred to as N+2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Understanding the "7 Nanometer" Designation

It's important to clarify that "7 nanometers" and similar process node numbers are primarily marketing terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. They do not correspond to any physical dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Instead, such a designation signifies that the chips are approximately 70% better in terms of power, performance, or area than the previous generation, such as 10 nm chips, which were in turn 70% better than 14 nm chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. For context, TSMC refers to their 7 nm node as N7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## [[smics_7nm_process_and_semiconductor_manufacturing | SMIC's N+2 Node]]

[[smics_7nm_process_and_semiconductor_manufacturing | SMIC's N+2 node]] is an evolution of their N+1 process, which was first taped out in October 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Both N+1 and N+2 nodes utilize DUV immersion lithography with multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. While [[smics_7nm_process_and_semiconductor_manufacturing | SMIC's N+2 node]] is capable of using EUV technology, the United States has imposed an export ban on this equipment, preventing [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] from selling it to SMIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## [[comparison_with_tsmcs_n7_process | Comparison with TSMC N7]]

TechInsights and SemiAnalysis note that [[smics_7nm_process_and_semiconductor_manufacturing | SMIC's N+2 node]] is remarkably similar to [[comparison_with_tsmcs_n7_process | TSMC's N7]], described as "99% the same" in physical measurements of transistors, FinFETs, and their placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. [[comparison_with_tsmcs_n7_process | TSMC]] began shipping N7 chips in high volume in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This means that a high-volume equivalent node from SMIC would place them approximately four to six years behind the leading edge of [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## [[economic_competitiveness_of_smics_nplus2_node | Economic Competitiveness of SMIC's N+2 Node]]

While N+2 is one of the most advanced processes available from any foundry to its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, its [[economic_competitiveness_of_smics_nplus2_node | economic competitiveness]] without EUV is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Although it's technically possible to fabricate chips at nodes even more advanced than N7 using 193 nm immersion technology and multi-patterning, as noted by Dr. Burn Lin, the father of 193 nm immersion lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, the key challenge is achieving meaningful yield in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Foundries like Samsung and Intel have famously struggled with yield and performance for their advanced nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. However, given that N+2 is very similar to [[comparison_with_tsmcs_n7_process | TSMC's N7 node]], which was ramped up without significant reported issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, it's anticipated that [[smics_7nm_process_and_semiconductor_manufacturing | SMIC's N+2 node]] could follow a similar yield optimization curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

In an open market, [[smics_7nm_process_and_semiconductor_manufacturing | SMIC's N+2 node]] would likely not be economically viable due to the availability of superior alternatives like [[comparison_with_tsmcs_n7_process | TSMC's N6]], an EUV-equipped evolution of their N7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Multi-patterning without EUV introduces manufacturing limitations and serious design restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Strategic Importance and Volume

Given the similarities to [[comparison_with_tsmcs_n7_process | TSMC's N7]], [[smics_7nm_process_and_semiconductor_manufacturing | SMIC's N+2 node]] may intrude on trade secrets, potentially leading to import bans in the US, as happened in 2002 and 2006 with previous SMIC products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This would likely limit [[smics_7nm_process_and_semiconductor_manufacturing | SMIC's N+2 node]] to domestic Chinese products and exports to friendly countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Despite this, [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's semiconductor manufacturing efforts]] have matured significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. HiSilicon, Huawei's chip design arm and formerly China's largest semiconductor company, is a prime candidate to leverage [[smics_7nm_process_and_semiconductor_manufacturing | SMIC's N+2 node]] for mobile processors and server chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. HiSilicon was a flagship customer of [[comparison_with_tsmcs_n7_process | TSMC]], producing chips like the Kirin 980, 985, and 990 on N7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This partnership could provide the massive production volumes necessary for foundries to scale and yield-optimize their process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Key Drivers of Progress

[[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China]] has long prioritized leading-edge [[semiconductor_manufacturing|semiconductor manufacturing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. A key figure in SMIC's recent advancements is Co-CEO Liang Mong-song, a [[comparison_with_tsmcs_n7_process | TSMC]] alumnus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Liang, known for his technical brilliance and relentless pursuit of the leading edge, joined SMIC in 2017, bringing his 200-person R&D team and reorienting the company towards advanced manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. His continued presence at SMIC is seen as crucial for the company's push towards the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Challenges in Semiconductor Manufacturing]]: Export Controls

Access to the latest lithography technologies is vital for [[smics_7nm_process_and_semiconductor_manufacturing | SMIC's progress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The US government has been pushing the Netherlands ([[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]]) and Japan (Nikon) to prevent the export of their immersion DUV lithography machines to [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. While the US has long blocked the sale of advanced EUV machines to [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, expanding this block to immersion lithography represents a new escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

Immersion machines use water and other fluids to improve the resolution of older 193 nm ARF laser technology, known as "dry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. They are mature and fundamental to modern [[semiconductor_manufacturing|semiconductor manufacturing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, with [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] and Nikon being the only suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Converting dry machines to immersion lithography is possible but requires substantial technical effort and expertise, potentially taking less than five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. An N7 equivalent node, however, demands more sophisticated immersion technologies, further extending this timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

An export ban on 193 nm immersion lithography technology without a corresponding ban on dry ARF technology (which is seen as infeasible) could add four to six years to [[smics_7nm_process_and_semiconductor_manufacturing | SMIC's march]] towards the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Such a ban is also likely to stimulate significant investment in Chinese-made lithography equipment, focusing first on maintaining existing immersion equipment and then facilitating the dry-to-immersion transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Whether Chinese companies can ultimately ship complete systems on par with [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] or Nikon remains debatable, with a gap of several years, but it's not insurmountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## [[future_prospects_for_chinese_semiconductor_manufacturing | Future Prospects for Chinese Semiconductor Manufacturing]]

Achieving a legitimate 7 nm node at high volume and good yield is a significant triumph for [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's advanced manufacturing industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Only three other companies have reached this level of scale and sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. While an immersion ban could temporarily expand the Sino-American semiconductor gap, it would not be a permanently damaging blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. The US administration likely values this bought time highly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. The American semiconductor industry, much like its response to the Japanese semiconductor challenge decades ago, must use this time to build new markets, improve manufacturing weaknesses, and adopt innovative suppliers to maintain its leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

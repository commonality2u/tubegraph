Today, Europe is a minor producer and consumer of chips, with EU firms making up a small percentage of semiconductor design, fabrication, and assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While there are world-leading equipment and chemicals companies like ASML, STMicroelectronics, and Infineon, the overall presence is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This current state was not inevitable, as Europeans independently invented the first transistor just months after the Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. France, in particular, was an early research pioneer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. However, this early optimistic lead was squandered, with Japan producing more transistors than France by 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The European semiconductor lag has persisted for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Early Innovations and Missed Opportunities (1940s-1950s)

While Bell Labs created the first transistor in 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, two scientists in Paris, Herbert Matera and Heinrich Welker, invented something similar just six months later, in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Matera and Welker had studied semiconductor materials to develop radar receivers for the German radar program during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. After the war, they relocated to France, resuming their work in Paris at a subsidiary of Westinghouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

On the side, they investigated an electrical effect Welker had previously noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. They constructed a device with two electrodes extremely close together, touching a sliver of high-purity germanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. They found that varying the voltage in one electrode could control and amplify electrical fields in the other, despite physical separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This contraption, known as the point-contact transistor, was conceptually similar to Bell Labs' invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Upon Bell Labs' public announcement of the transistor in 1948, Matera and Welker realized the significance of their own device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. France's Secretary of Post, Telephones, and Telegraphs, Eugene Thomas, urged them to patent it and suggested the name "transistron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. In May 1949, Thomas held a press conference announcing the transistron, hailing its superiority to vacuum tubes and demonstrating its use in high-quality radio receivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Patents for the transistron were granted in the United States in 1951 and in France in 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. By late 1949, Westinghouse had built a factory in France capable of producing tens of thousands of transistrons monthly for telephone system amplifiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

However, the French government, prioritizing nuclear technology after Hiroshima, decided to focus resources there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The telecommunications industry was left to private enterprise without government funding, causing work on the transistron to languish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Matera and Welker eventually moved on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Welker returned to Germany to work at Siemens R&D Labs, where he pioneered work for LEDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Matera also returned to Germany, founding a small semiconductor production company, Intermetal, before immigrating to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Manufacturing and Research Challenges

Europe's semiconductor efforts in the 1950s centered on France, as West Germany faced technology restrictions from the Allied occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Despite impressive early achievements, including the transistron and replication of the original transistor, the French effort struggled with manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The early years of semiconductor manufacturing were complex and unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, leading French teams to conservatively turn towards more abstract and theoretical research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

This contrasted with the American semiconductor industry, which effectively managed early unpredictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Bell Labs openly dispersed production knowledge and liberally granted licenses, believing in the widespread adoption of the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. American teams were also more interdisciplinary; for example, the "Traitorous Eight" co-founders of Fairchild Semiconductor were recruited by William Shockley, with only Robert Noyce having a formal semiconductor background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Shockley encouraged scientists to handle technological processes themselves to devise improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

Another reason for France's abstract focus was a lack of joint business-government initiatives to bring theoretical breakthroughs to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Pierre Aigrain, the unofficial patron of French semiconductor research, founded a solid-state physics lab, but his interests did not extend to industry, keeping most of his students in theoretical research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. French businesses also underinvested in R&D, with a survey finding less than a quarter of French companies from 1880-1940 had in-house R&D labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The French electronics industry continued to use outdated vacuum tube technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, and transistorized French radios did not widely appear until around 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

Economic and political crises in France (1957-1958), partly due to the Algerian War, led to austerity policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The French transistor industry, 90% government-dependent, lost funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. French consumer electronics companies turned to imports, but a falling franc eroded profits and impeded future investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. By the end of the 1950s, the French semiconductor industry had squandered its early research lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## The Integrated Circuit Era and Divergent Demands (1960s)

The 1960s saw the rise of the integrated circuit (IC), jointly invented in 1958 by Texas Instruments and Fairchild Semiconductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The military played a critical role in shaping the American semiconductor industry, buying half of its total output by the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Projects like the Minuteman 2 ICBM and the Apollo program drove demand for smaller, lower-power, and reliable devices, forcing American firms to hone techniques for high-performing devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

In contrast, European semiconductor demand in the 1960s primarily came from the consumer sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. While the military made up 50% of the U.S. semiconductor market in 1960, it was only 29% in France and 8% in West Germany in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Consumer demand, in contrast to military demand, emphasized price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. European electronics companies like Philips and Siemens were vertically integrated giants, viewing semiconductors as components rather than end products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. They focused on evolutionary improvements to in-house transistor technologies, prioritizing cheapness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Philips and Siemens also believed silicon was only suitable for high-temperature applications, focusing instead on germanium transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

Meanwhile, the U.S. industry was characterized by startups and spin-offs (e.g., Shockley Semiconductor, Fairchild, Intel, AMD) that produced semiconductors as end products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Fairchild's mass production of silicon planar transistors obsoleted the alloy junction transistor space, widening the technological gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

Japan, starting in a similar position to France or Germany, rapidly adopted transistor technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Driven by domestic demand for transistor radios and TVs, and with government support gating imports, Japan's industry built semiconductor manufacturing competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Mass semiconductor production grew 125 times in the latter half of the 1950s, matching American levels by 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Japanese companies signed over 250 technology licensing agreements with foreign companies from 1952-1968, quickly mastering and innovating upon these acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. In Europe, despite companies like IBM and Texas Instruments building factories, successful technology transfer did not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

In 1961, the French government's plan to support its calculator and computer industries inadvertently turned them against the nascent semiconductor industry, as computer makers found French semiconductors uncompetitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. France's 1966 "Plan Calcul" aimed for a national computer, further sidelining the domestic semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. The issue was primarily production scale; French chip makers could not keep up with foreign competitors' aggressive cost-cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. European manufacturers largely survived in niche markets like analog circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

## The Rise of LSI and VLSI, and Europe's Lag (1970s-1980s)

The 1970s brought rapidly increasing complexity with Intel's introduction of the first microprocessor, the Intel 4004, in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. This new era of Large-Scale Integration (LSI) meant significant investment was needed for new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. By 1969, computers overtook government/military as the leading demand driver, consuming 44% of the American IC market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. This demand emphasized high performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. Europe lacked the production capability for high-performance LSI devices and a strong source of demand for them, as European computer companies were much smaller than their American counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

Traditional European semiconductor demand industries (military, telecommunications, consumer electronics) could not compensate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. European military and avionics demand was weak, especially in West Germany, and favored established firms over disruptive technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. The fragmented Telecom market also did not drive leading-edge chip demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

Japan's semiconductor industry, after a strong start, also fell behind the U.S. in LSI systems, with Japanese IC output worth just a quarter of the American industry in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. In 1978, Japan held 20% of the worldwide IC market, trailing America's 74% share, while Europe had only 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

To combat IBM's dominance, Japan's political leadership launched the Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) project in 1976, budgeting hundreds of millions of dollars to unite computer makers for cooperative development of next-generation VLSI technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. The VLSI project helped Japanese semiconductor makers hone techniques for putting tens of thousands of transistors onto a single chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

In West Germany, industrial policy was more market-oriented and decentralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Flagship companies like Siemens and AEG, the two largest indigenous semiconductor producers in 1972, significantly lagged the Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Siemens estimated a decade-long lag in the late 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. Although the West German government budgeted $1.4 billion from 1974-1979 to advance its domestic semiconductor industry, this money was funneled through Siemens and AEG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. Siemens was notably conservative, preferring bonds to technology investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. The decline of AEG in the 1970s further weakened West Germany's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Both Siemens and AEG lost market share in Europe's largest semiconductor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.

### Strategic Alliances and Pan-European Efforts

The 1980s presented a mixed European semiconductor landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. While high-performing semiconductors were made, a European producer capable of challenging Americans was hard to find <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. Encouraging foreign chipmakers to build factories in Europe in the 1970s only increased pressure on domestic companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. Europe developed a large and growing Information Technology trade deficit, reaching almost $7 billion in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. This deficit partly resulted from European tech companies' tendency to form technology alliances with American firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. For example, Ericsson's component subsidiary, Rifa, allied with National Semiconductor, AMD, and Texas Instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. Siemens formed alliances with Intel, Toshiba, and Fujitsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>. Only 25% of European IT companies formed alliances with other European companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

Despite past spending on "national champions," European policymakers shifted direction in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. In 1982, French President François Mitterrand unveiled a five-year microelectronics plan to spend 4.5 billion francs annually on chip R&D and industrial-university connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. French subsidies drove new investment but paled in comparison to American and Japanese economic might <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.

In 1984, West Germany launched a semiconductor R&D program, allocating a billion Deutsche Marks over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. A prominent initiative was the "Mega project," a joint effort with the Dutch government to help Siemens and Philips develop 4-megabit DRAM and 1-megabit SRAM, respectively, by 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. Siemens successfully debuted its 4-megabit chip in March 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>. However, Siemens had licensed 1-megabit DRAM technology from Toshiba, and Philips worked with Matushita for SRAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. The pace of innovation was too fast; Japan's NTT had already debuted a 16-megabit DRAM chip by March 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

In 1989, the Mega project evolved into the "Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative (JESSI)," a €4 billion pan-European consortium to develop 6-megabit DRAMs and advanced custom chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. JESSI faced significant issues: Philips exited memory production in 1990 due to financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>, Britain's ICL was ejected after Fujitsu acquired a majority stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>, and Siemens allied with IBM, abandoning its 16-megabit memory plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. JESSI's budget consistently shrank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.

By 1979, European producers had 60% of world semiconductor production; this fell to 12% in 1985 and 10% in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. By 1991, European companies held less than 30% of their own market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.

## Intensified Competition and Niche Markets (1990s-Present)

The 1990s brought skyrocketing technological and financial barriers to semiconductor entry; a 250-nanometer memory fab cost $1-2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. Competition intensified with the rise of Asian foundries like TSMC, Charter Semiconductor, and Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. TSMC's pioneering independent foundry model opened the gates for semiconductor outsourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

Semiconductor demand structures continued to disfavor Europe. European firms lost the consumer electronics space to Asian companies, military and government spending declined after the fall of the Soviet Union, and computing remained dominated by American firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Europe's strengths remained in industrial, telecommunications, and automobile fields, but these did not capture the majority of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

Europe's decline in semiconductors is attributed to a combination of factors compounded over half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>:
*   **1950s:** Europe fell behind the U.S. due to political, technological, and production issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **1960s:** Strong American military spending drove technological progress and competence, favoring disruptive startups over traditional giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.
*   **1970s:** European policy focused on building larger computers to match IBM, incorrectly disregarding semiconductors as a future focus, unlike Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.
*   **1980s-1990s:** Despite some R&D success, the trend of semiconductor manufacturing outsourcing and the rise of the Asian supply chain intensified market competition, relegating European manufacturers to specialty markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

In 2021, the EU announced plans to build strategic autonomy by increasing its share in high-end chip fabrication, aiming to double Europe's share in semiconductor production from its current 10% to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. Historically, European governments and the EU have been willing to financially support their semiconductor industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. However, past rounds of government money, R&D coordination, and forced company consolidations have yet to reverse the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

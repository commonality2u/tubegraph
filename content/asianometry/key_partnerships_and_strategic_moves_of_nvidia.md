In 1995, over 30 companies competed to build the best graphics chips for personal computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Six years later, only three remained, with [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] clearly in the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. As of the video's writing, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] was the 15th biggest company globally, valued at half a trillion dollars, with its graphics cards selling out instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The company was also seeking to acquire ARM for $40 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Founding and Early Challenges

[[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Huang served as president and CEO, while Malachowsky and Priem focused on the technical side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The company's core intention was to create microprocessors capable of rendering high-quality 3D graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Their name, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]], is derived from the Latin word meaning "envy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

The concept of dedicated hardware for 3D graphics predated [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]], with early examples like Atari's graphics chips in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Commercial video cards emerged in the 1980s, such as the [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | IBM]] Professional Graphics Controller (PGA), which used an onboard Intel micro-processor to offload video tasks from the CPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Although the PGA was expensive and limited to [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | IBM]] PCs, it established the idea of a video card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

In the late 1980s, Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) dominated the graphics market, refining the "graphics pipeline" concept and releasing OpenGL, a widely adopted 3D graphics standard, in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. While SGI excelled in workstations, it didn't focus on the consumer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Consumer interest in graphics surged with Microsoft Windows 3.1's graphical user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> and especially with the release of 3D games like *Doom* (1993) and *Quake* (1996) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. *Quake*'s demand for high-performance 3D rendering led to the rise of specialized graphics cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

3dfx, a graphics chip startup, capitalized on this by releasing the Voodoo video card, leveraging OpenGL compatibility (via a wrapper) and falling RAM prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The Voodoo card, designed by 3dfx, manufactured in Taiwan, and sold to board partners, was the first consumer card capable of running *GL Quake* well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Despite only offering 3D acceleration and requiring a separate 2D card, it sold extremely well, giving 3dfx 80% of the 3D acceleration market at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Nvidia's Initial Strategic Partnerships and the NV1 Flop

During this period of market dominance by 3dfx, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] was struggling in a downturned Silicon Valley market, being just one of many graphics chip startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Jensen Huang secured $2.5 million in funding from two VC firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, and established three crucial early partnerships:

1.  **Manufacturing Partnership with SGS-Thomson Microelectronics**: Founded in 1994, this partnership allowed [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] to focus on design while SGS-Thomson handled chip manufacturing, as [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] could not afford its own fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
2.  **Board Partner Deal with Diamond Multimedia Systems**: Diamond Multimedia agreed to buy [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s chips and integrate them into their multimedia accelerator boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
3.  **Gaming Partnership with Sega**: Sega, a popular video game company, sought [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s help to port their arcade and console games to PCs. Crucially, Sega allowed [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] to use its brand name for the launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

These partnerships led to [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s first product, the NV1, released in May 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The NV1 was an ambitious multimedia PCI card that integrated graphics, sound, and Sega gamepad support, aiming to be the "Sound Blaster of multimedia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. However, it tried to do too much, resulting in compromises, and critically, it was not compatible with leading graphics APIs like OpenGL or 3dfx's Glide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. As a result, the NV1 was a flop and was discontinued in late 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. A planned collaboration with Sega for the NV2, their next-gen console, also fell through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## The "Change Everything" Moment and Three Key Bets

After the NV1's failure, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s leadership decided to "change everything," similar to Samsung Group Chairman Lee Kun-hee's famous command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. They abandoned the multimedia space and bet on three rising trends:

1.  **Betting on Microsoft Direct3D**: Microsoft had noticed the surge in 3D PC gaming and wanted a "horse in the race" against OpenGL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. In 1996, Microsoft acquired RenderMorphics and created Direct3D, a 3D graphics API that was part of its DirectX bundle and built into Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Despite initial criticism from developers like John Carmack of id Software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] bet its future on Direct3D's promised improvements and its tight integration with Windows, believing it would become the dominant API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
2.  **[[vertical_integration_and_business_strategy_in_tech_companies | Vertical Integration]] of Device Drivers**: Historically, board partners (OEMs) wrote most device drivers for graphics chips, leading to misaligned incentives and suboptimal device experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] decided to take driver development in-house, aligning incentives and allowing them to dedicate significant time and resources to creating high-performing drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This became a critical, lasting competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
3.  **Outsourced Manufacturing and Moore's Law with [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]]**: [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] sought a partner that could keep pace with their relentless product cycle and Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. In 1998, they ended their partnership with SGS-Thomson and partnered with [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Jensen Huang contacted [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]] founder Morris Chang, appreciating [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]]'s pure intentions: their success was tied solely to their partners' success, pledging never to compete with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. This partnership allowed [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] to focus entirely on design, optimizing for speed and rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] became one of [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]]'s biggest customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

## The RIVA 128 Success and Nvidia's Relentless Cycle

With these strategic changes, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] launched its second product, the RIVA 128, in 1997, with less than six weeks of cash left in the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. The RIVA 128 was specifically designed to accelerate Direct3D and crucially supported both 3D and 2D graphics, a key advantage over 3dfx's Voodoo cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. It retailed for about $140 and sold well, with Diamond Multimedia reselling it as the Diamond Viper 330 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

[[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s partnership with [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]] enabled a relentless six-month product cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. The company organized its design teams into three groups: one for the upcoming design, one for a refresh of the previous year's design, and one for the next year's design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. They adopted advanced chip design processes, including extensive computer-aided design verification and validation, to minimize costly errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. This aggressive cycle ground down the graphics card industry, forcing many companies to drop out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Only ATI (later acquired by [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | AMD]]) was able to keep up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

## Competitor Missteps: 3dfx and Intel

While [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] executed its strategy, competitors made critical errors:

*   **3dfx's [[vertical_integration_and_business_strategy_in_tech_companies | Vertical Integration]] Blunder**: In 1998, 3dfx, concerned about its brand image, acquired boardmaker STB for $141 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. They announced that their chips would only be available in their own name-branded boards, directly competing with their former board partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. This alienated their customers, who defected to [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. 3dfx also struggled with manufacturing, as STB's Mexico-based facilities could not compete with Asian manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. This [[vertical_integration_and_business_strategy_in_tech_companies | vertical integration]] strategy destroyed value and burned cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. 3dfx eventually dissolved and sold its assets to [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.
*   **[[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | Intel]]'s Failed Entry**: [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | Intel]] predicted that 80% of PCs would have 3D graphics by the millennium and aimed to dominate the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. In 1998, [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | Intel]] released the Intel 740 card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. However, it struggled with adoption of its AGP port format over the popular PCI standard, and real-world performance lagged despite good speed tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | Intel]], accustomed to longer CPU development cycles, could not keep up with the rapid pace of the graphics market and discontinued the i-740 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. While [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | Intel]] later leveraged its CPU monopoly to gain massive market share in integrated graphics, these low-performance solutions wiped out the market for low-margin graphics needs, further consolidating the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

## Market Consolidation and Beyond Graphics

By the early 2000s, the graphics card market had consolidated from over 30 companies to just three: [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] and ATI formed a clear duopoly, with [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | Intel]] occupying the low end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] and ATI battled until [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | AMD]] acquired ATI in 2006 for $5.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | AMD]]'s graphics cards now sell well and are used in game consoles, but [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] holds the leading position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

[[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s successful [[vertical_integration_and_business_strategy_in_tech_companies | vertical integration]] into device drivers, adding significant business value and a competitive edge, contrasted sharply with 3dfx's misstep into manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

Since its dominance in graphics chipsets, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] has looked beyond solely video game graphics. In 1999, they coined the phrase "General Processing Unit" (GPU), popularizing the concept of general-purpose computing and envisioning new applications beyond traditional graphics, a vision that would come to pass in the years to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This foresight paved the way for [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s pivotal role in the modern [[the_ai_and_ai_chip_boom_landscape | AI]] and [[nvidia_and_competition_in_the_ai_chip_market | AI chip market]] landscape.

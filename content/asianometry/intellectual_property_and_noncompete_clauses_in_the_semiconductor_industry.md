The semiconductor industry, characterized by its rapid innovation and significant strategic importance, places a high value on [[Intellectual property and noncompete clauses in the semiconductor industry|intellectual property]] and frequently utilizes non-compete clauses to protect its technological advancements and competitive edge. This is exemplified by the dramatic defection of Liang Mong-song, a prominent figure in the industry.

## The Case of Liang Mong-song: A Renegade's Journey

Liang Mong-song, described as "unquestionably brilliant but scathingly difficult to work with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, was a key figure at TSMC for nearly two decades before his defection to Samsung, TSMC's biggest competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This event is considered one of TSMC's most dramatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Early Career and Contributions at TSMC

After studying at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in Tainan and the University of California, Berkeley, under Professor Hu Ten-ming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, Liang worked at AMD for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. During his time at AMD, he was named in over 180 critical semiconductor patents and published over 350 technical papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

In 1992, at the age of 40, Liang returned to Taiwan to join TSMC's R&D department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. He was part of a group of brilliant semiconductor minds, including Professor Hu, Chiang Chang-yi, Rick Tsai, and Douglas Yu, who returned from the United States to contribute to Taiwan's semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Morris Chang, TSMC's founder, was also a significant "American migrant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Liang played a critical role in TSMC's adoption of the FinFET technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. He was instrumental in TSMC's decision to develop its own copper interconnect implementation in 2003, rejecting IBM's licensed technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This move allowed TSMC to surpass IBM and was a critical event in the company's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. For his contributions, Liang was awarded the 2003 Outstanding Scientific and Technological Worker award by the Taiwan government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. He is named on nearly 500 TSMC patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

TSMC compensated Liang handsomely, with his total stock and cash compensation over 17 years exceeding $21 million USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Departure from TSMC and Non-Compete Agreement

Despite his brilliance, Liang's stubborn personality led to frequent clashes with colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. He was described as "very strict on technology, very rigorous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, and "inflexible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This personality led to his transfer in 2005 to a new initiative called "Beyond More or More than More," which focused on trailing edge foundry capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Liang viewed this as a "banishment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a> due to his obsession with leading-edge technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

In February 2009, Liang resigned from TSMC after 17 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. As part of his resignation agreement, TSMC implemented "golden handcuffs," holding back a significant portion of his payout until he fulfilled a two-year non-compete agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Liang stated he would care for his parents and teach at National Tsing Hua University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

### Defection to Samsung and Legal Battles

However, in October 2010, six months into his non-compete period, Liang took a visiting scholar position at Sungkyunkwan University in Korea, which has close ties with Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. TSMC became suspicious when Samsung rapidly gained ground in process node development after Liang's departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Liang repeatedly denied working at Samsung during his non-compete period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

On July 2011, two months after his non-compete expired, Liang officially joined Samsung as Executive Vice President of Samsung Foundry and Technical Director of Samsung LSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. He brought with him a team of 10 to 20 TSMC engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

Four months later, TSMC filed a lawsuit in Taiwan against Liang, alleging he had broken his non-compete agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Liang's defection and the subsequent legal battle had a significant impact on Samsung's manufacturing progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

Samsung, under Liang's guidance, abandoned their 20 nanometer process plans and successfully jumped directly from 28 nanometers to 14 nanometers, adopting FinFET technology at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This allowed Samsung to announce their 14 nanometer process node ahead of TSMC's 16 nanometer process in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, breaking TSMC's near-monopoly in advanced semiconductor foundry business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. This led to major clients like Qualcomm and Apple splitting their chip production with Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

TSMC's lawsuit against Liang initially failed, but on appeal, the company presented compelling evidence:
*   Liang's lectures at Sungkyunkwan University were to Samsung employees and took place on Samsung's campus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.
*   Technical analyses showed Samsung's 45nm, 32nm, and 28nm chips became "very technically close to TSMC's after 2009" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.
*   Liang used a Samsung email address as early as 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

The Taiwan Supreme Court ruled in favor of TSMC, mandating that Liang could not work for Samsung until after the end of 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. In 2015, Samsung encountered issues with their Apple A9 chips, which reportedly ran hotter than TSMC's counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. TSMC, under Morris Chang's renewed leadership, mobilized a massive R&D effort to regain node leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. Apple's subsequent A10 chip and all following chips became TSMC exclusives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

### Second Defection to SMIC

In 2015, SMIC, a Chinese foundry, aimed to return to the leading edge and targeted Taiwanese talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. After his Samsung contract ended in 2017, Liang joined SMIC with a team of 200 Taiwanese and South Korean engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. He was appointed co-CEO, focusing on leading-edge technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. Under Liang, SMIC improved the yield of its 28 nanometer process node from 60% to over 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. He then pushed for a multi-generational jump to 14 and 12 nanometers, achieving a 95% yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. His efforts to acquire an EUV machine from ASML were blocked by the US government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>, impacting China's ability to compete in leading edge manufacturing, a significant aspect of [[Impact of export bans on semiconductor technology|impact of export bans on semiconductor technology]]. Liang is now pursuing the 7 nanometer node, the last achievable with older DUV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

## Industry Perspectives on Non-Compete Clauses

The semiconductor world is described as "twisted and ruthless" due to its [[Impact of geopolitical tensions on semiconductor industry|national security implications]] and government subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Companies engage in fierce competition, including legal battles over [[Intellectual property and noncompete clauses in the semiconductor industry|intellectual property]]. For instance, TSMC previously sued China-based SMIC for patent infringement and won, effectively stifling a competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

While non-compete clauses are not popular in the West, where there's a belief in freedom to work anywhere (e.g., California prohibits them) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, they are a critical tool in the high-stakes semiconductor industry. The story of Liang Mong-song highlights that success in the industry is not just about advanced machinery but fundamentally "about the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a> and the [[Intellectual property and noncompete clauses in the semiconductor industry|intellectual property]] they develop.

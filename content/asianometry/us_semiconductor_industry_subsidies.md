The United States has enacted significant measures to bolster its domestic [[semiconductor industry water usage | semiconductor industry]], primarily through substantial subsidies. This has led to major investments and developments, particularly concerning TSMC's operations in Arizona and other major chip manufacturers.

## The CHIPS Act of 2022

A primary driver behind the current surge in US semiconductor manufacturing is the [[government_subsidies_and_their_effects_on_the_semiconductor_industry | CHIPS Act of 2022]], which allocates $50 billion in subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. These subsidies are designed to incentivize the construction and expansion of semiconductor facilities within the United States.

## Major Investments Driven by Subsidies

The presence of these subsidies has prompted significant investments from major players in the semiconductor industry:

*   **Samsung**: Building a $17 billion plant in Taylor, Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Intel**: Developing a massive $20 billion chip plan in Columbus, Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **TSMC**: Has been working on a new production facility in Arizona since May 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Initially planned for N5 chips, TSMC later announced they would bring their N4 process to Arizona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   TSMC is also investing another $28 billion over three years (into 2026) to open a second Arizona factory, which will be equipped with N3 technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This N3 factory should be in high volume production by 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Strategically, TSMC should accept these subsidies as it means fewer funds are available to support the build-outs of competitors like Intel and Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Customer Influence

The decisions by companies like Apple to source from the US also influence TSMC's investments. Apple, which accounts for approximately 25% of TSMC's total revenue, is a singular customer bankrolling the most advanced chip rollouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. According to Bloomberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated, "we have already made a decision to be buying out of a plant in Arizona" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. If Apple expresses a desire to source from the US and the economics align, TSMC will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. TSMC aims to avoid the risk of Apple returning to Samsung or defecting to Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Concerns and Perspectives on US Subsidies

The expansion of TSMC's operations outside of Taiwan, particularly to the US, has caused nervousness in Taiwan, leading to discussions about whether America is "stealing" TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. However, the move is rooted in a confluence of demand and financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Scale of Investment

Despite the significant investments in the US, the speaker argues that the claims of America "stealing" a lot of Taiwan's manufacturing, causing "massive loss" to the Taiwanese economy, are difficult to credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

*   **Capital Expenditure**: TSMC's second Arizona Fab investment adds about $28 billion over three years, or roughly $9 billion per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This represents about 25% to 30% of TSMC's proposed annual capital expenditure of $36 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The majority of the company's spending will still be in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Wafer Shipments**: The Arizona factory, when it starts production in 2024, will produce around 20,000 300mm equivalent wafers a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This is less than 1/50th of TSMC's current annual production of 1.3 million wafers a month, a significant number of which are produced in Taiwan (estimated 75% to 85%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Even after planned expansion to 50,000 wafers a month in 2026, it will still not be enough to represent a massive shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Continued Investment in Taiwan**: TSMC is simultaneously juggling at least five other build-outs in Taiwan, including new N2 plants in Baoshan and potentially Taichung, and future plans for an N1 plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. They are also moving ahead with an N28 build in Kaohsiung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### No Evidence of Technology Transfer

The notion that America is forcing a [[government_subsidies_and_their_effects_on_the_semiconductor_industry | technology transfer]] from TSMC to an American company is not supported by evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Such transfers typically involve joint ventures with indigenous companies, specific requirements for indigenous product content, and enhanced knowledge transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. TSMC is not engaged in a joint venture in Arizona and has historically owned its Fabs outright, including in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Limitations of US Self-Sufficiency

The assumption that the Arizona Fab makes America self-sufficient in silicon is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a> for several reasons:

1.  **Chip Types**: The Arizona Fab will produce leading-edge N4 and N3 chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. However, the majority of the world's most industrially important semiconductors (for fridges, airplanes, cars) are older nodes like 130nm, 65nm, and N28, which are high in volume but low in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
2.  **Other Taiwanese Foundries**: Taiwan also hosts other significant semiconductor foundries like UMC (number three largest), Powerchip (seventh), and Vanguard (eighth), which possess specialty processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
3.  **Supply Chain Dependence**: Taiwan holds leading positions in other parts of the chip supply chain, including wafers, packaging, assembly, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. America's share in global packaging, assembly, and test capacity is only 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. There is no comparable Arizona Fab or national government funding for conventional packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Taiwan has three of the world's five largest outsourced semiconductor packaging, assembly, and testing companies, including ASE Group, SBIL, and Powertech Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Duplicating this global supply chain would be immensely expensive, possibly economically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
4.  **Human Capital**: The managers running the fabs, including thousands of difficult-to-replace R&D, operations, and supply chain management personnel, are primarily in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Billions of dollars and 50 years of industrial development have made Taiwan a leader not just in semiconductor manufacturing but also in electronics assembly and specialty plastics, which cannot be replaced quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

Taiwan remains TSMC's greatest asset, and TSMC has no choice but to go "all in" on Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Competing on Intel's home turf without this core strength is seen as a "recipe for eventual failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The speaker concludes that the current "status quo" has benefited everyone and hopes it continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

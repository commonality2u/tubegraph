From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 
The [[history_of_hard_disk_drives | hard disk drive]] (HDD), once the most expensive component of a PC, is a complex piece of technology featuring magnetically enabled heads flying over glass platters to read and write data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Despite its technical marvel, the [[competitive_dynamics_and_market_saturation_in_the_hard_disk_drive_industry | hard disk drive]] industry has often been a "graveyard for profits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This article explores the birth, boom, and bust of the [[competitive_dynamics_and_market_saturation_in_the_hard_disk_drive_industry | Hard Disk Drive]] industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Beginnings

In 1952, IBM established a new research laboratory in San Jose, led by Reynold B. Johnson, a talented inventor who had previously created a machine for grading pencil-marked multiple-choice tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. IBM acquired the rights to his machine and hired him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The San Jose lab was chosen for its location between major IBM customers in Los Angeles and Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Johnson's team was given broad freedom to work on various projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. One significant project involved developing a random access processing system to replace "tub files" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Tub files were part of punched card systems, offering a form of random access, meaning any piece of information could be accessed quickly, unlike sequential access where all data must be cycled through first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. For memory systems, random access is superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Disks

The IBM team explored magnetic recording systems to achieve this random access function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. After evaluating various magnetic media like tape, drums, plates, wires, and rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, Johnson opted for a stack of rotating magnetic disks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This format offered significant surface area and the potential for simultaneous data access on multiple disks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

An early prototype used about 120 aluminum disks, each two feet wide and spaced a quarter-inch apart, stacked on a shaft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This array spun at approximately 3,600 revolutions per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Building RAMAC

Two main technical challenges emerged during development:
1.  **Even Coating**: Applying iron oxide paint evenly and smoothly onto the disk surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This was solved by spinning the disks at high speed and pouring the paint (the same type used for the Golden Gate Bridge) at the center, a technique now known as "spin-on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
2.  **Wobble Management**: Maintaining a consistent thousandth-of-an-inch distance between the read/write heads and the disk surface despite disk wobble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. A team led by Bill Goddard and John Lynott integrated an air nozzle into the head, using air pressure to create a stable air cushion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

In 1956, IBM introduced the 305 "Random Access Method of Accounting and Control" (RAMAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. RAMAC was a transaction processing system built around what is widely considered the first [[history_of_hard_disk_drives | hard disk drive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. The drive featured 50 iron oxide-coated disks, each about 61 centimeters wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. It cost a quarter of a million dollars, stored about 4.4 megabytes, and was the size of two refrigerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Despite these seemingly comedic stats today, it was an engineering marvel for its time, particularly for its ability to retrieve data in under a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. IBM President Thomas Watson Jr. hailed it as the "greatest product day in IBM's history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## An Industry is Born

IBM's success with the [[history_of_hard_disk_drives | disk drive]] made it an essential part of computers, thus birthing a new industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Initially, other computer manufacturers like General Electric and Burroughs began producing their own HDDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Soon, independent disk companies such as Bryant Computer Products and Data Products emerged, offering third-party HDDs to computer makers without in-house expertise or capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. By the mid-1960s, Japanese firms like NEC, Fujitsu, and Hitachi also started producing their own hard drives, primarily for internal use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

In 1966, IBM introduced its 2314 File Facility and disk packs, which not only improved speed and performance but also offered a 29-megabyte disk pack format that allowed for easier swapping of storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. This led to a new wave of independent companies copying the disk pack format and marketing "plug compatible" products to IBM customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Winchester

Throughout the 1960s, IBM continued to lead in [[innovations_and_challenges_in_hard_disk_drive_technology | hard disk drive]] storage innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Their most significant contribution came in 1973 with the introduction of the Winchester drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The name "Winchester" originated from a comment by IBM San Jose manager Kenneth E. Haughton, who nicknamed the project "30-30" (for its two 30-megabyte spindles), referencing the Winchester rifle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

Previously, disks were removable and accessible, leading to particle contamination issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. IBM's solution was to seal the disks, individual arms, and motors within a dust-proof container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This not only resolved contamination but also allowed for greater storage capacity by significantly reducing the distance between the head and the disk surface (to a thousandth of the RAMAC's distance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The closer the head, the higher the data density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, resulting in a 30% cost-per-megabyte reduction over competing designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The Winchester design became an industry standard, with HDDs often referred to as "Winchester Drives" for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Shugart

Alan Shugart, involved in the early development of the Winchester drive at IBM's San Jose lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, led various memory projects, including a small, cheap read-only device for program transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Released in 1973 as the "Type 1 Diskette," this device is now commonly known as the floppy disk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Shugart left IBM in 1969 due to a transfer to New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. After a stint at Memorex, he founded Shugart Associates, which later dominated the eight-inch and 5.25-inch commercial floppy drive markets before being acquired by Xerox in 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Shugart 2 (Seagate)

After leaving Shugart Associates, Alan Shugart founded another company in Scotts Valley, originally named Shugart Technology, but later renamed Seagate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Shugart's goal with Seagate was to adapt the IBM Winchester drive for the emerging microcomputer (PC) market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Recognizing that PC-makers had adopted the 5.25-inch floppy drive (which came about at the request of Dr. An Wang of Wang Laboratories for a smaller, cheaper alternative to the 8-inch floppy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, Seagate aimed to build an [[history_of_hard_disk_drives | hard disk drive]] that fit the same space but offered significantly more capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

In 1980, Seagate announced their ST506 hard drive, which offered 5 megabytes of storage, far surpassing a floppy disk's 160 kilobytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Despite costing over $1,000, it was an immediate success, generating $9.8 million in revenues in 1981, and growing to $110 million two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## Engineering Marvels

Modern [[history_of_hard_disk_drives | HDDs]] operate on the same core concept as RAMAC and early floppy disks, comprising four key sub-components: platters, motors, read-write heads, and supporting electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Data bits are stored on tracks on double-sided glass platters, which are mounted on spindles and spun by motors at 3,600 to 7,200 revolutions per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Heads, positioned by actuators, "fly" over the platters to access data, with electronics monitoring and supporting their movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

While the concept remains, the engineering has been completely overhauled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Seagate's first 5-megabyte Winchester HDD in 1980 was considered an engineering marvel, compared to a Boeing 747 flying at Mach 4 just an inch off the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Today, heads fly as little as 3 nanometers above the disk surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Producing these machines requires significant capital expenditure for component sourcing, assembly in cleanrooms, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Commoditization

Despite the advanced engineering, the [[competitive_dynamics_and_market_saturation_in_the_hard_disk_drive_industry | hard disk drive]] market largely became a commodity market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Computer memory, especially secondary memory, tends to be a commodity, with customers always seeking more storage and willing to switch suppliers for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. "Brand value" never gained significant traction in the HDD industry; users typically upgrade PCs for other reasons (e.g., OS, CPU), not specifically for a new HDD brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

As a result, PC assemblers like IBM leveraged competition among HDD makers, buying from whoever offered the lowest price meeting specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. IBM, for example, sourced most HDDs for its growing PC business in the early 1980s from startups like Seagate, MiniScribe, and IMI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. IBM demanded rigorous qualification and second-sourcing, and refused long-term contracts due to the fast-moving market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

## Piling In

The modular nature of the [[innovations_and_challenges_in_hard_disk_drive_technology | HDD]], with its four precisely engineered but separate components, contributed to intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Only the platters and read/write heads directly influenced storage capacity and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This allowed new firms to quickly tweak one of these critical parts, integrate it, and bring a new product to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

Initially, HDD firms did not aggressively protect their trade knowledge and innovations with patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Ideas flowed freely among the small community of HDD researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. When a firm introduced a new hit format or technology, competitors quickly developed their own versions, eroding any potential profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. For example, the Scottish firm Rodime patented the 3.5-inch HDD format in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. However, its popularity only surged in 1986 when Conner Peripherals sold it widely to Compaq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. The format's success invited massive competition, and Rodime, unable to keep up with scale and capability, filed for bankruptcy twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

A later example is Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR), a Nobel-winning quantum effect that revolutionized the HDD's read/write head, enabling greater area density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Although discovered in Europe, IBM first commercialized GMR in 1997 with a 16.8 Gigabyte HDD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. American competitors like Seagate and Read-Rite had their own GMR heads two years later, and Japanese firms rapidly licensed and bought the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Toshiba introduced their first GMR-equipped HDDs in 1998, famously later developing a tiny 1.8-inch HDD used in the Apple iPod in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

## Venture Capital

The influx of new firms was heavily financed by venture capital (VC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Changes in capital gains tax rates and pension fund investment regulations at the end of the 1970s spurred the rise of VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Seagate's successful IPO in September 1981, just over a year after launching their HDD, raised $26 million and provided significant returns for its VCs, paving the way for modern VC investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

By mid-1983, 12 VC-backed [[history_of_hard_disk_drives | HDD manufacturers]] were publicly traded, with a combined market capitalization of $5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. VCs poured money into the [[competitive_dynamics_and_market_saturation_in_the_hard_disk_drive_industry | disk drive industry]], recruiting talent to found startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. Between 1977 and 1984, 43 different disk drive manufacturers raised $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. By then, around seventy firms were operating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. When the PC market experienced a pullback in 1983-1984, it triggered a massive shakeout, with many startups failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. This "Zerg rush" of entrants drastically changed the market; the "Old Guard" vertically integrated HDD companies saw their market share drop from 84.8% in 1978 to just 7.9% a little over a decade later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

## Globalization

Initially dominated by US firms, the [[impact_of_globalization_on_the_hard_disk_drive_market | hard disk drive industry]] faced increasing competition from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. Japanese computer makers (Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC, Toshiba) shifted from internal HDD production to an OEM model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. However, American firms aggressively globalized their manufacturing, mitigating the initial impact of foreign competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

In 1984, Seagate began outsourcing HDD assembly to Singapore, a move facilitated by the Singapore Government's Economic Development Board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. By 1990, Singapore became the world's largest producer of HDDs, holding 55% of shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. As Singapore's labor costs rose, lower-value work, such as actuator arm assembly, moved to other Southeast Asian regions like Malaysia and Thailand, while Singapore focused on higher-value tasks like platter fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

Japanese firms eventually caught up by outsourcing their production abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. In the early 2000s, they even captured a majority share of the HDD market when Hitachi merged with IBM's HDD division, though this advantage was later eroded by further competition and mergers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

## Responses

The intense [[competitive_dynamics_and_market_saturation_in_the_hard_disk_drive_industry | competition]] and [[impact_of_globalization_on_the_hard_disk_drive_market | globalization]] in the HDD industry yielded enormous benefits for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. From 1976 to 1987, HDD data density increased twenty-fold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. The cost of a megabyte of data storage plummeted from $560 in 1977 to $11.89 in 1986, $6.86 in 1990, and just 4.3 cents by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

However, this unsustainable market led to widespread company exits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. The number of HDD firms peaked at 66 in 1990 but was cut in half to 33 by 1994, with many startups failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. By 1998, only 16 firms remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. Even after this shakeout, the market still had too many players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. Between 2000 and 2010, four more major HDD firms exited: Quantum, IBM, Maxtor, and Fujitsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. IBM, the inventor of the [[history_of_hard_disk_drives | HDD]], merged its HDD operations with Hitachi's in 2002 after struggling to gain more than 25% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

## Conclusion

Today, the [[competitive_dynamics_and_market_saturation_in_the_hard_disk_drive_industry | hard disk drive market]] is dominated by three major makers: Seagate, Western Digital, and Toshiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. The [[history_of_hard_disk_drives | HDD]] is gradually being replaced by new technologies like Solid State Drives (SSDs), indicating a fading period of growth and innovation for the traditional HDD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

The "crazy boom and bust" of the HDD industry highlights how aggressive [[impact_of_globalization_on_the_hard_disk_drive_market | globalization]] by American firms allowed them to retain significant market share despite competition from Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. By the mid-1990s, no HDD assembly factories remained in the United States, but higher-paying American jobs in R&D, head manufacturing, and gimbals were preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. The industry's brutal competition raises questions about whether different architectural or strategic decisions could have altered its fated trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

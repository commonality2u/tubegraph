From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The People's Republic of Albania, often called Europe's most isolated country, pursued economic self-reliance throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, which ultimately led to it becoming the third poorest country globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This strategy involved repeatedly aligning with and then splitting from major Communist powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Early Economic Context

Before its communist era, Albania was a small country in Southeast Europe, about 25% smaller than Taiwan, with a population of about 2.8 million people today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Its capital is Tirana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The country has beautiful landscapes, with 20% covered in forest, numerous rivers, and massive mountain ranges like the Albanian Alps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. However, the mountainous, swampy, and forest-laden terrain makes finding arable land difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

In 1912, newly established Albania was a feudal society of about a million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. It possessed rich natural resources like oil, but these were largely undeveloped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. In 1927, the average national income was a mere $40, and the economy was dominated by large, absentee landowners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Foreign powers, particularly Italy, exerted significant influence, though they contributed little to economic development beyond starting some oil production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. King Zog I, who declared himself king in 1928, clashed with Italians over economic integration but could not improve the country's economy, which relied on natural resources like oil, and exports such as cheese, animal skins, eggs, and livestock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The Great Depression in the 1930s further deepened Italian influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Adoption of Stalinist Economic Policies

After World War II, Albania became the only country in Central or Eastern Europe "liberated" without Allied help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Under the leadership of [[enver_hoxhas_leadership_and_stalinist_policies | Enver Hoxha]] and the Communist Party of Albania, the country swiftly moved to establish a centrally planned socialist economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

The **Stalinist economic model** implemented in Albania involved:
*   **Central Planning**: The government decided all economic aspects, including prices, production levels, investment, and wages, laid out in 5-year plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
*   **Collectivization of Agriculture**: Though slower due to limited arable land, by 1956, 696 collective farms held 40% of the land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Labor for these farms often required "greater force" from party officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
*   **Rapid Build-up of Heavy Industry**: This was prioritized at the expense of consumer products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Massive textile factories, like the Stalin Textile Complex, were built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

This system led to "strange contradictions and shortages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. While employment was guaranteed, individuals had no choice in their jobs, and failure to meet goals could result in labor camp sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Despite official claims of meeting quotas, people ate less meat in 1953 than in 1949, and food rationing continued until 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

## Economic Alignments and Splits

### Severing Ties with Yugoslavia
Initially, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia helped found Albania's Communist Party and provided military and governmental assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. In return, Yugoslavia pushed Albania to join its federation, leading to close technical and economic agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Albania supplied natural resources to Yugoslavia, which then sold industrial goods back at inflated prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Hoxha, feeling exploited and under threat of replacement, seized the opportunity when Stalin turned against Tito, securing Soviet guarantees against Yugoslav attack and a free hand to purge pro-Yugoslav elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. After 1948, Albania severed ties with Yugoslavia and joined COMECON, entering the Soviet orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

### Breaking Up With the Soviets
From 1949 to 1951, all of Albania's trade was with COMECON states, with the Soviet Union accounting for half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. The Soviets provided significant food and military aid, totaling about $200 million between 1948 and 1960, and transferred technologies, including building airfields and a submarine base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

However, after Stalin's death in 1953, Khrushchev's new policies, such as repudiating the Stalin cult of personality and reconciling with Tito, clashed with Hoxha's views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. Albania began to align with the People's Republic of China, which also had a rift with Khrushchev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. By 1957, Chinese aid grew to 21.6% of Albania's total trade balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

The Sino-Soviet Split eventually led to Albania's full break with the Soviets in November 1960, when Hoxha criticized Khrushchev in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. In April 1961, the Soviets withdrew their considerable aid, which had made up 50% of Albania's economy from 1946 to 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. In October 1961, Khrushchev publicly called Hoxha an "unreconstructed Stalinist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Albania was subsequently expelled from the Warsaw Pact and COMECON, leaving China as its sole significant ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

### Breaking Up With China
China attempted to replace Soviet aid, sending technicians and advisors who took the same salaries as average Albanians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. Mao Zedong even declared Albania the "only beacon of true socialism left in Europe" in 1966, promising military support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. However, China itself was a developing country facing a severe famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. Geographical distance caused delays in aid, with one delivery of textile plant machinery taking a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. Chinese aid struggled to replace what was lost from the Soviets, making the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) highly challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

The "Chinese love affair" ended when China began overtures to the West in 1969, leading to President Nixon's visit in July 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. This alienated Albania, which had valued its position as China's "only real" ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. In 1976, Hoxha purged army and Party members with pro-Chinese leanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. After Mao's death and a visit by Tito to Beijing in 1977, Albania ramped up its rhetorical attacks on China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. In July 1978, China cut off all aid to Albania, which at that point constituted half of the country's economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

## Extreme Self-Reliance (Autarky)

After the Chinese aid cut, the concept of **self-reliance** became the cornerstone of Albania's economic strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. This was a fundamental concept in Stalinist economies, but Albania's unique isolation pushed it to an extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. Hoxha declared Albania as the only country still building socialism and enshrined the principle of self-reliance in the 1976 Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

For the next 12 years, Albania went completely alone, rejecting all foreign aid or credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. Albanian companies were forbidden from engaging in joint ventures with foreign countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. Key aspects of this policy included:
*   **Ramped-up Exports**: To acquire hard currency for investment goods, Albania focused on exporting its major goods: oil, chrome ore (chromite), copper, and electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. It diversified trade partners, even semi-relaxing relations with Yugoslavia and COMECON (excluding the Soviet Union) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.
*   **Data Control**: Economic data was tightly controlled, with only positive results released publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
*   **Food Self-Sufficiency**: The country aimed for complete self-sufficiency in food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. Swamps were drained to expand arable land from 391,000 hectares in 1950 to 713,000 in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. In 1976, Albania claimed self-sufficiency in bread grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

## Economic Stagnation and Decay

Despite initial claims of victory by Hoxha, the policy of self-reliance led to deep and prolonged economic stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.
*   **Slow Growth and Decline**: Throughout the 1980s, Albania's economy grew at an average of 1.7%, effectively zeroed out in the latter half of the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. With a population growth rate of 2%, the average Albanian became poorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.
*   **Environmental and Market Shocks**: A five-year drought (1983-1988) crippled agricultural output and hydropower generation, impacting both electricity exports and chromite mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. A global oil glut simultaneously crashed petro-prices, further damaging a key economic pillar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   **Technological Backwardness**: Oil production fell far short of targets (1.2 million tons vs. 3 million target in 1985) due to obsolete and broken equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. Engineers attempted to rebuild machinery, costing more than simply purchasing new equipment from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. An exhibition of "Albanian technology" in 1984 featured tractors from the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.
*   **Widespread Poverty and Hardship**: Families were severely rationed for meat, butter, and eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. The average monthly wage in 1984 was $15, and people could not even keep their own livestock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. Even in Tirana, water and electricity were only available for a few hours daily, and living conditions were extremely cramped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.

## The Fall of the Self-Reliance Policy

Hoxha's successor, Ramiz Alia, recognized the economic decay and began to introduce gradual changes after Hoxha's death in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. He made quiet outreaches to the West, establishing diplomatic relations with West Germany, Spain, and Canada, and relaxed travel restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. However, these reforms were insufficient, and popular discontent grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. By 1989, other Communist governments in Eastern Europe were collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.

Massive protests erupted in 1990, leading to a breakdown of law and order and widespread looting, causing further economic damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>. Industrial output in the third quarter of 1991 was 60% lower than the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>. Alia's final attempts at reform failed, and he called for free elections instead of using force against protestors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. In March 1992, the Democratic Party won power, marking the end of the communist era and the beginning of [[albanias_transition_from_communism | Albania's transition from communism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

## Conclusion

Albania's pursuit of total economic "self-reliance" under [[enver_hoxhas_leadership_and_stalinist_policies | Enver Hoxha]] led the country down a path of anti-development and into severe economic stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. Despite being blessed with natural resources and a strategic position, its isolationist policies prevented it from leveraging these advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. After 1992, Albania began one of the fastest transitions to capitalism, though a profound need for further economic reform remains today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.

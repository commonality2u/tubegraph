From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 
In late August 2023, [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | Huawei]] quietly started selling its own phone chips again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | Huawei]] Mate 60 Pro went on sale without much fanfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The phone's System-on-Chip (SOC), the Kirin 9000s (麒麟9000s), is a 7-nanometer class chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | Huawei]] didn't disclose the manufacturer, it is most likely [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### The Phone and the Chip

The Mate 60 Pro is described as a very nice phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. TechInsights reported the Kirin 9000s has a die size of 107 square millimeters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This is approximately 2% larger than the Kirin 9000 and 9000E, which were [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | Huawei]]'s previous leading-edge chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The older Kirin 9000 was briefly produced using [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]]'s 5-nanometer process before American sanctions ended that collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The new 7-nanometer class chip is about 5-6 years behind the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]] has been shipping 3-nanometer class chips in 2023 for the September iPhone 15 launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Teardowns and speed tests suggest the Kirin 9000s supports 5G connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, though [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | Huawei]] appears to be concealing this functionality, as their press releases don't mention 5G, and the phone's OS reports 4G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

The SoC's CPU core is a customization of [[the_significance_of_arm_and_riscv_in_chinas_semiconductor_industry | Arm IP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The GPU seems to be a new custom [[chip_design_process_and_techniques | design]] by [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | Huawei]] or HiSilicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This new GPU [[chip_design_process_and_techniques | design]] initially caused texture errors in games like Genshin Impact, which are expected to be fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

Yields are a significant point of discussion; Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis suggests [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]]'s early yields for this node are likely better than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Yields typically start low but improve as the fab refines its processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]] successfully scaled its N7 yields for iPhone launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, and the same can happen for [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]]; increased phone sales will accelerate this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Despite limited public information, the 7nm chip is real, and the manufacturing node appears to be very good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Why Are We Surprised?

The emergence of this chip shouldn't be a surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Previous predictions indicated the expectation of a HiSilicon chip utilizing [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]]'s N+2 process node at 7nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. HiSilicon is a subsidiary of [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | Huawei]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Furthermore, Nikkei Asia had mentioned in early August that [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]] was collaborating with [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | Huawei]] on a new 5G chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

News of the [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]] N+2 process first appeared in July 2022, when it was used for a Bitcoin miner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Bitcoin miners, with their repetitive structures, serve as good use cases for improving a node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. A phone SOC like the Kirin 9000s is a much more complex chip to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. The successful production of the Kirin 9000s demonstrates significant progress by Co-CEO Liang Mong-song and [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]] in about a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### More Chips are Coming

More advanced chips are anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. In January 2022, Dr. Burn Lin, a former [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]] R&D director and colleague of Liang Mong-song, stated that [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]] could fabricate even 5-nanometer class chips using only multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

Immersion lithography, a technology 1-2 decades old, remains critical and perhaps the best lithography technology available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. While the United States banned EUV lithography exports, 193-nanometer immersion machines like the Twinscan NXT 2000i may still perform 70-80% of the lithography work for [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | Intel]], [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]], and [[impact_on_tsmc_and_samsung | Samsung]]'s latest nodes for the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The US administration initially held back on banning 193i due to concerns about cooperation from Japan and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. These countries only joined the export restrictions on June 30, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

[[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]] still possesses many of these machines to ramp up 7-nanometer production and move towards 5-nanometer, despite potential issues with spare parts and maintenance due to sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Consequently, a 5-nanometer class [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | Huawei]] chip is fully expected within 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### A China-Only Supply Line is Emerging

The Mate 60 phone represents more than just a high-performing chip; it is embedded within an ecosystem of domestic Chinese suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. These suppliers have collaborated to create a phone that achieves feature-parity with the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Bloomberg reported on the phone's numerous domestic suppliers, including its radio frequency front-end module and satellite communications modem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. With the exception of memory, which appears to be from SK Hynix, the entire phone is essentially a China-only ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This sets the stage for a complete, self-contained ecosystem within the People's Republic of China for producing various domestic electronics, including smartphone SOCs, CPUs, edge [[the_ai_and_ai_chip_boom_landscape | AI]] NPUs, GPUs, and [[the_ai_and_ai_chip_boom_landscape | AI accelerators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### [[the_ai_and_ai_chip_boom_landscape | AI]] is the Next Big Move

While a phone chip on par with a five-year-old release might not seem like a major breakthrough universally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, it is expected to significantly impact Qualcomm, Apple, and MediaTek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Ming-chi Kuo noted that Qualcomm sells tens of millions of chips for [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | Huawei]] phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. These sales are likely to be replaced by the new Kirin 9000s and similar chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, causing non-Chinese semiconductor makers and Apple to lose business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

[[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]] will likely be busy fulfilling [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | Huawei]] orders for the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. However, [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]] is encouraged to seek new N+2 node customers in high-powered computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, specifically a partner to develop a domestic [[the_ai_and_ai_chip_boom_landscape | AI accelerator]] akin to an Nvidia A100 or TPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. A Chinese 7-nanometer [[the_ai_and_ai_chip_boom_landscape | AI accelerator]] is expected within 1-2 years, potentially designed by Biren, Baidu, Alibaba Cloud, or Tencent, unless sanctions intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### What China Does Next

China is actively building its native [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | semiconductor manufacturing]] and technology ecosystem, which deserves praise given the impact of sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. From a [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | semiconductor manufacturing]] perspective, the primary goal should be to widely distribute the Mate 60 phone to maximize scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Millions of units are currently being sold, but more are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. The phone and its chips should be sold not only to Chinese domestic consumers but also to Europeans, Australians, Southeast Asians, and Latin Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

Despite [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | Huawei]] phones not shipping with Google products, [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | Huawei]] has engaged in influencer marketing to inform users on how to install Google products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Every export sale not only impacts Western phone makers but also strengthens [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Increased chip sales lead to more manufacturing, accelerating yield improvements and profitability, which in turn funds the move to 5 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

[[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]] should also focus on reviewing and replicating advanced packaging technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. For phone chips, packaging emphasizes thinness and heat, using technologies like Chip Scale Packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. However, for advanced [[the_ai_and_ai_chip_boom_landscape | AI]], considerations like data bandwidth require new architectures such as chiplets and 2.5D die-stacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. The Chinese Government also needs to strengthen its domestic [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | semiconductor manufacturing]] equipment ecosystem, aiming to replace foreign suppliers like ASML, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, Lam Research, and metrology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Foreign equipment likely includes remote kill switches, making domestic replacement essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### What America Does Next

Jordan Schneider of ChinaTalk offers insights on how the United States should respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security justified cutting off foreign support for "advanced semiconductors" (logic ICs at 16/14nm or below) in the October 7th restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

> “The restrictions implemented in this rule follow extensive United States government consideration of the impact of advanced computing ICs, “supercomputers,” and [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | semiconductor manufacturing]] equipment on enabling military modernization, including the development of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and human rights abuses." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>

This implies that the US government believes China's ability to manufacture advanced logic chips has significant implications for the regional military balance of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Given the progress by [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]] and [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | Huawei]], if a Chinese 7-nanometer node is still considered a national security threat, the US government might intensify efforts to stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

This requires a better understanding of which [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | semiconductor manufacturing]] equipment is still reaching China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]] relies on foreign equipment for this node, as domestic suppliers are years behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Equipment companies like Applied, Lam Research, Tokyo Electron, and KLA can currently sell most of their tools for deposition, etch, metrology, and epitaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Tools used for 7nm and even 5nm can plausibly be used for 28nm processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. These tools are sold to [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]] ostensibly for lagging-edge nodes, but are almost certainly repurposed for chips like the Kirin 9000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

To prevent China from developing leading-edge capacity at scale, the US government, in cooperation with allies like Japan, the Netherlands, and Germany, should consider tighter export controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. These controls should target repurposed tools such as Argon Fluoride Immersion lithography, mask, and CMP equipment, and restrict liberal use of licenses for firms like [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | SMIC]] on the entity list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

### Conclusion

The Kirin 9000s represents a significant mark in technology history, sending ripples beyond the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. The People's Republic of China is adopting a similar approach to [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | semiconductor manufacturing]] as South Korea did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. In 1986, [[impact_on_tsmc_and_samsung | Samsung]] surprised Japan with its 1 megabit DRAM chip, reducing the Korean-Japanese semiconductor gap from five years to one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. By 1988, [[impact_on_tsmc_and_samsung | Samsung]] achieved parity with Japan by releasing its 4 megabit chip, contributing to Japan's subsequent decline in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This approach worked for South Korea, and it appears to be working for China as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

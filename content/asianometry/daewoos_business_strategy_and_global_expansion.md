The Daewoo Group, at its peak, was Korea's fourth-largest business conglomerate, alongside Hyundai, Samsung, and LG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The company experienced a rapid ascent driven by a favorable political climate and significant debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. However, it eventually collapsed due to its liabilities, a severe recession, and widespread fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This article details the [[rise_and_fall_of_daewoo_group | rapid rise and startling collapse of Korea's Daewoo Group]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Early Strategy and Textile Dominance

Founded in 1967 by Kim Woo-joong at age 30, Daewoo Industrial began as a textiles trading company with modest capital and four employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The name "Daewoo" (大宇) literally translates to "great universe," signifying Kim's ambitious vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Kim's initial breakthrough came in 1970 by convincing major American department stores like Sears, J.C. Penney, and Montgomery Ward to sell Daewoo textiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. A crucial strategic move occurred when American customers informed him of an upcoming U.S. government quota on textile imports, which would allocate percentages based on current market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Daewoo aggressively prioritized gaining market share over immediate profits and even product quality before the quota's imposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This bold tactic paid off, and in 1972, Daewoo secured 30% of the quota, providing significant initial capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Within four years, Daewoo became Korea's second-largest exporter, with over four million dollars in textile exports, establishing a de facto monopoly that funded future expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Diversification and Expansion through Acquisitions

Throughout the 1960s, President Park Chung-hee's administration promoted [[export_growth_and_international_competitiveness | exports and capacity building in strategic industries]], offering favorable loans to compliant companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Daewoo embraced this directive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

Starting in 1973, Daewoo diversified into a wide array of new industries, including:
*   Machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   Shipbuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   Construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   Automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>

This expansion was primarily achieved through acquisitions and joint ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Daewoo was noted for its ability to turn around struggling companies, exhibiting relentless perseverance and a high appetite for risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Hankook Machinery (1976)**: Acquired a struggling industrial machinery manufacturer, renamed it Daewoo Heavy Industries, and turned a profit in its second year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Okpo Shipbuilding (1978)**: Acquired and merged with Daewoo Heavy Industries; the shipyard became profitable five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Core Business Playbook and Export Focus

Daewoo's strategy across its diverse businesses mirrored its textile success:
*   **Market Share Over Profits**: Prioritizing high volume and low prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Limited Brand Focus**: Rarely prioritizing brand development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Underinvestment in Technology**: Little focus on upgrading technologies or moving into more valuable market segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

In line with government preferences, Daewoo heavily focused on exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Chairman Kim Woo-joong famously traveled 260 days a year, with Daewoo selling most of its goods in emerging markets across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Government Ties and Debt-Fueled Growth

Daewoo's rapid growth was significantly bolstered by its close relationship with the Korean government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Founder Kim Woo-joong had personal ties to President Park Chung-hee, whose primary school principal was Kim's father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The company also regularly hired government elites and retired state bankers for executive positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

These connections allowed Daewoo to secure "absurdly favorable loans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. While annual inflation reached 40% and private banks charged high interest rates, Daewoo's loans were in the 6-9% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. In exchange for these preferential loans, monopoly protections, favorable labor laws, and silent backing, Daewoo and other chaebols contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to presidential slush funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Ownership Structure and Control

Initially, Daewoo's core holding company was privately owned by Kim and his family, a common structure for Korean chaebols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. In the 1970s, the Korean government pressured chaebols to go public to boost stock market liquidity and allow public participation in economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Daewoo resisted, as they relied on bank funding, but eventually complied after the government protected family control by curbing certain shareholder rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

To guarantee control, the family established a complex cross-ownership structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. By 1997, Chairman Kim and his family owned, on average, only 6.1% of shares in Daewoo Group companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. However, with subsidiaries owning about 30% of each other, Kim effectively controlled an average of 38.3% of the votes, making him unchallengeable by other shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This intricate structure and interlocking dependencies (Daewoo companies primarily used each other's services) made it difficult to assess true profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Entry into the Automobile Business

In 1978, Daewoo entered the car business by partnering with GM Korea to acquire 50% of Sehan Motor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. By 1992, Daewoo acquired full control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Daewoo Motors applied the same business playbook: low prices and low quality, with minimal focus on R&D and technical upgrading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This strategy, especially in a cut-throat industry, strained the company's finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## Challenges and Shifting Landscape

The assassination of President Park Chung-hee in 1979 marked a significant shift in Korea's regulatory and economic climate, placing Daewoo on less stable ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Subsequent governments began opening up markets to foreign competition, and the era of easy, cheap loans started to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

The 1980s introduced new challenges to Daewoo's low-price, low-quality strategy:
*   **Appreciating Won**: The South Korean won appreciated, making Daewoo's exports more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Rising Labor Costs**: South Korean labor wages increased as living conditions improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Protective Trade Barriers**: Other countries began adopting trade barriers to favor domestic industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **China's Emergence**: China began opening up, with its exporters adopting similar low-cost strategies, directly competing with Daewoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Shipbuilding Bailout and Moral Hazard

In 1988, Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery faced near bankruptcy, carrying $1.8 billion in debt and grappling with difficult market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Daewoo sought a government bailout, arguing that they had only acquired the shipyard at Park Chung-hee's request and that the Korea Development Bank had not fully delivered on promised equity injections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Both Daewoo and its employees expected a bailout, with employees even striking for significant wage increases, confident in government intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

The government did bail out Daewoo Shipbuilding in 1989, providing 200 billion Korean won in preferential loans and injecting another 50 billion won directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This reaffirmed Daewoo's perceived closeness to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Although Kim acknowledged the need for change towards "more quality, less quantity" and initiated product quality improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, these initiatives lost momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. The bailout fostered a "moral hazard," where Daewoo felt shielded from the full consequences of its risky actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

## Global Automotive Buying Spree

Instead of focusing on quality, Kim plunged back into what became his most costly obsession: cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. After gaining full control of its unprofitable motor subsidiary in 1992 (which lost $200 million that year), Daewoo Motors embarked on a massive global buying spree to become a leading automotive player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. This expansion was likely funded partly by the 1989 bailout money given to Daewoo Shipbuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

Notable acquisitions and ventures include:
*   **1994**: Acquired a technical center in the UK and started a joint venture in Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **1996**: Spent $1.8 billion to purchase a Polish car company and a truck factory, making Daewoo the country's second-largest automaker after Fiat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
*   **1996**: Opened an $800 million car plant in Uzbekistan, capable of producing 200,000 cars annually for the Russian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Later Acquisitions**: Bought a Czech truck manufacturer and entered Ukraine and India via joint ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Total Scope**: In total, Daewoo purchased 14 car factories in 13 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

Many of these ventures failed, yet Daewoo refused to pull out, believing in their growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. For instance, they were losing $30 million a year in India and sold only 423 cars in Vietnam in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This culminated in a majority takeover of the troubled SsangYong Motor Company in January 1998, at the peak of the [[Impact of financial crises on South Korean business practices | Asian Financial Crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## Reliance on Debt and Structural Vulnerability

Daewoo's aggressive expansion was overwhelmingly financed by debt. While all chaebols used debt (averaging a 400% debt-to-equity ratio in the 1980s and 1990s), Daewoo carried the most debt, exceeding $11 billion into the 1990s, and was the most structurally vulnerable to [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt crises]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

Unlike other chaebols centered around a profitable "cash cow" core company (like Samsung Electronics), Daewoo's core, Daewoo Corporation, was primarily a trading and financial company that prioritized revenues over profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. It funded its subsidiaries through borrowings, leaving the entire group on "thin ice" without a strong internal source of cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

## Recklessness During the Asian Financial Crisis

By April 1997, on the eve of the [[Impact of financial crises on South Korean business practices | Asian Financial Crisis]], Daewoo had the lowest price-to-book ratio among Korea's top chaebols (1.12 compared to Samsung's 6 and Hyundai's 3.66), indicating market suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

The crisis, which saw the Korean won plunge and the economy shrink by nearly 7% in 1998, triggered Daewoo's insolvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. While other chaebols pulled back, Daewoo continued its reckless expansion, discounting products and acquiring new companies, including SsangYong in January 1998, which added even more debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. Throughout 1998, despite immense existing debt, Daewoo raised another $14.1 billion, becoming the nation's single most indebted company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Investors likely believed the government would intervene with another bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

## Accounting Fraud and Collapse

Daewoo had been in discussions with the government for a bailout since June 1998, but Chairman Kim resisted austerity measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. In late 1998, recognizing the financial contagion risk, the government restricted financial institutions from holding more than 5% of their portfolio in Daewoo debt, effectively cutting off Daewoo's credit lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

While Daewoo agreed to a downsizing plan in December 1998, consolidating 51 companies into 10 and aiming to reduce its 500% debt ratio, this restructuring lacked enforcement, and creditor banks failed to withdraw funding when targets were missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Rumors of last-minute deals and political connections sustained false hopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

The reality was that by the end of 1998, Daewoo was already bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Despite reporting sales increases, the company recorded a half-trillion Korean won loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. This loss was masked by widespread accounting fraud, particularly "fictitious overseas asset sales" between sister subsidiaries at inflated prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. These schemes allowed Daewoo to record false profits and revalue assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Without these fraudulent practices, Daewoo's loss in 1998 was estimated to be eight times higher, around four trillion won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. Other estimates put the total fraud in 1997-1998 as high as 23 trillion won ($19 billion), marking Korea's largest accounting fraud at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

By mid-1999, it became clear Daewoo was not meeting debt reduction targets and was heading for default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. On August 1999, Kim was removed, and Daewoo's subsidiaries were placed into bankruptcy, to be sold off in parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. At its collapse, Daewoo owed over $50 billion in debt to 140 banks in more than 100 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Kim fled the country for five years before returning, facing trial, and eventually receiving a presidential pardon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

The [[impact_and_aftermath_of_daewoos_accounting_fraud | collapse of Daewoo]] led to trillions of won in losses for banks and insurance companies, requiring government injection of public funds to prevent further collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. It spurred extensive reforms in investor transparency, banking oversight, and the Korean accounting industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

Australia stands as the world's leading [[australias_role_in_global_lng_exports | exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, having exported $25 billion worth of natural gas to Asian markets in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite this global leadership, the country occasionally experiences [[domestic_natural_gas_shortages_in_australia | natural gas shortages]] within its own domestic markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This paradox highlights Australia's sprawling size, abundant natural resources, and complex energy politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Natural Gas Reserves and Distribution
Australia possesses significant proven natural gas reserves, estimated at approximately 3 trillion cubic meters in conventional reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. If unconventional gas fields like coal seam gas and shale gas are included, the total could be as high as 12 trillion cubic meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

However, a major challenge lies in the uneven distribution of these resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Almost 80% of Australia's conventional gas resources are concentrated in its northwest region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.

> [!INFO] Natural Gas Types
> *   **Conventional Gas**: Free gas trapped in porous reservoir rocks like carbonates, sandstones, and salt stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
> *   **Unconventional Gas**: An umbrella term for gas that is more difficult to tap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. This includes shale gas (trapped in tiny pores within shale rock) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a> and coal seam gas (absorbed and trapped in coal deposits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## Challenges in Transporting Natural Gas
Transporting natural gas is inherently difficult, as reserves are often located far from population centers where they are consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
Traditionally, pipelines have been used for transport, offering convenience and economy for shorter distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>, but they lack flexibility and their construction can be politically controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

For longer distances, especially beyond 700 miles overseas or 2,200 miles on land, [[australias_role_in_global_lng_exports | liquefied natural gas (LNG)]] becomes more economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Natural gas is cooled to -260 degrees Fahrenheit, condensing into a liquid that takes up 1/600th of its former volume, making it easier to transport in tanker ships or trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. However, the significant downside of the LNG approach is the need for expensive liquefaction plants, which represent a large upfront cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

## Lack of an Integrated National Pipeline System
A critical challenge for Australia, given its vast size, is the absence of an integrated nationwide gas pipeline system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. The country's 47,000-kilometer pipeline network is a patchwork quilt of three largely separate subsystems:
*   Northern market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>
*   Western market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>
*   Eastern market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>

Each of these markets operates largely independently, relying on local gas fields and their own pipeline systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. This fragmented system exists due to physical distance and varying regulatory regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>, contributing to a significant national energy security problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>: Australia struggles to transport natural gas from areas of abundance to areas of urgent need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

For instance, the distance from Dampier (Western Australia) to Sydney is roughly 3,202 miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>, too far for private entities to economically build a sustainable pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

## Historical Export Bans and Policy Shifts
In the 1960s and 1970s, as new natural gas fields were discovered, foreign interest emerged, sparking feelings of [[government_policies_and_international_partnerships_in_australias_lng_market | economic nationalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. In 1970, Australia's federal government imposed a general export embargo on [[australias_role_in_global_lng_exports | LNG]] to prioritize domestic requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

### The Northwest Shelf Venture
The Northwest Shelf project, a joint venture that began in the mid-1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>, discovered significant natural gas at Scott Reef in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>, followed by discoveries at North Rankin and Goodwin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. These fields contained over 300 billion cubic meters of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>, more than enough for the Western Australian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. The venture planned a $12 billion project to develop resources, build an LNG plant, and export to the world market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

However, the nationwide export ban remained in effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. The left-wing federal government of the time resented foreign involvement and requested at least 50% local ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. The project, being capital-intensive, required foreign funds and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. Without export capability, the project would not proceed, as the Western Australian market was too small to justify the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

In 1975, a more right-leaning and business-friendly government came to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Obstacles began to fall away:
*   The venture naturally reached the 50% local ownership threshold when Burma Oil sold its stake to BHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
*   In 1977, the federal government lifted its export embargo, allowing the Northwest Shelf venture to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. They stipulated that exports would be permitted only after domestic requirements were considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>, initially allowing 50% of production for export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.
*   Tax benefits were introduced, including an extended investment allowance, an income tax rebate, and waived oil and resource taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.

The Northwest Shelf venture struck deals with eight Japanese customers in 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a> and began construction in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. It involved offshore platforms, undersea gas pipelines, a massive LNG plant, LNG tankers, and a pipeline from Dampier to Perth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. The first LNG exports to Japan commenced in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. Today, Japan and China purchase 75% of Australia's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.

While the Northwest Shelf project has been highly beneficial for Western Australia, providing 64% of the state's energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>, it did not resolve the broader national distribution issues. The state governments in Australia's eastern markets, the country's largest, were disheartened by the lack of progress on a nationwide gas pipeline project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

## Current Distribution Challenges
Australia's northern and eastern markets, particularly the eastern market covering major cities like Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Hobart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>, face significant supply challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. Australian energy demand is growing rapidly, with average consumption increasing by 0.6% annually, driven by industrial demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

### Unconventional Gas Developments
The large market size and rapid growth spurred new developments in unconventional natural gas, particularly coal seam gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. While the southern and eastern regions lack conventional gas fields, they possess significant coal deposits with absorbed methane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>. Capturing this methane, previously vented as a workplace hazard, began with BHP's breakthrough in Queensland's Bowen Basin in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. This led to a coal seam gas boom in eastern Australia, with gas production growing ninefold due to domestic market growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.

State governments have encouraged the shift from coal to gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>, such as Queensland's 2005 gas scheme requiring electricity retailers to produce 13-15% of their electricity from gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>.

However, once again, the export markets beckoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>. The Queensland state government approved three consortia to build LNG plants and export coal seam gas to Asian markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. By 2016, all three plants were operational, capable of producing 26 million tons of [[australias_role_in_global_lng_exports | LNG]] each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
In 2020, Australia became the world's leading [[australias_role_in_global_lng_exports | exporter of liquefied natural gas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>. The country's rise as a natural gas export power, combined with its reputation as a reliable Western-aligned country, has significantly helped stabilize global energy markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>.

Despite this international success, Australia's [[domestic_natural_gas_shortages_in_australia | domestic markets face significant energy shortages]] and rising prices, which impede growth and cause political awkwardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. While ideas such as a transcontinental pipeline or a nationwide gas reservation policy exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>, there is no single solution. Australia's [[domestic_natural_gas_shortages_in_australia | natural gas dilemma]] requires a coherent nationwide strategy incorporating various ideas to be fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>.

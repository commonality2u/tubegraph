Robots play a crucial role in responding to and mitigating the aftermath of nuclear disasters, particularly in environments too hazardous for human entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These machines are designed to perform critical tasks such as site inspection, decontamination, debris removal, and fuel debris management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The [[fukushima_daiichi_nuclear_disaster | Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster]]

In March 2011, a massive tsunami, triggered by the Great East Japan Earthquake, crippled the cooling systems of the [[fukushima_daiichi_nuclear_disaster | Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This led to nuclear fuel meltdowns and hydrogen explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Tepco, the plant's owner, and the Japanese government have invested billions in the site's safe [[decommissioning_process_of_fukushima | decommissioning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The Fukushima plant had six units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Units four, five, and six were not operational during the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. While units five and six suffered only minor tsunami damage, unit four was damaged by the tsunami and experienced a hydrogen explosion from exhaust spillover from unit three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:01:03]</a>. However, since unit four's reactor was shut down, its fuel rods sustained little damage, resulting in tolerable radiation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:12]</a>. Units one through three, which were operational when the tsunami hit, suffered the most severe damage, including meltdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:17]</a>. Units one and three also had hydrogen explosions that released radioactive materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:23]</a>.

## [[history_of_nuclear_response_robots | History of Nuclear Response Robots]]

The development of nuclear response robots began after the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:31]</a>.

*   **Three Mile Island**
    *   Two robots were first used for site inspection in high-radiation areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   The "Surveillance and In-service Inspection Robot" (SISI) was deployed in August 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:46]</a>. This crawler-like robot took photographs, collected samples, and measured radiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   "FRED" (Fuel Removal Equipment Device), introduced a year later, was equipped with a high-pressure water spray for decontamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:02:05]</a>.
    *   Three "Remote Reconnaissance Vehicles" were built to de-fuel the reactor core, which was flooded with radioactive water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:13]</a>. These early robots were practical, tethered, small, and built with familiar technologies, successfully flushing, scraping, and cleaning walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:24]</a>.

*   **Chernobyl**
    *   After the Chernobyl disaster, hundreds of thousands of human "liquidators" were called upon to clean up debris, partly because radiation levels were so high that available robots failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:48]</a>. Bureaucratic issues also contributed to the reliance on human labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   Eventually, robots were brought in, notably the "Specialized Transport Robot" (STR-1), a wirelessly controlled bulldozer adapted from an unmanned lunar vehicle, used for debris removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Robotics at Fukushima Daiichi

The first robots arrived at Fukushima in April 2011, three weeks after the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:22]</a>.

*   **Initial US Robot Deployment**
    *   Four "Pakbot" military multipurpose robots from American company iRobot Corporation were deployed to enter the damaged units 1, 2, and 3 reactor buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:34]</a>. Pakbot, first used in Iraq and Afghanistan for detecting improvised explosive devices, is small (30 kg) and resembles metal extension arms on a tread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:49]</a>. After training, they entered Unit 2 to measure radiation, temperature, and oxygen concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:04:04]</a>.
    *   A larger iRobot "Warrior" was brought in for cleaning, vacuuming, and clearing obstacles throughout the second half of 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:16]</a>. Other cleaner robots included "Bobcat" and the Swedish-built "Brock 90" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:19]</a>.
    *   The "T-Hawk," a small unmanned aerial vehicle from Honeywell, flew over units one through four from April to July 2011 to review the situation and collect dust samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:33]</a>.

*   **Japanese Robot Development and Challenges**
    *   The reliance on American robots sparked mild controversy given Japan's reputation in robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   Following a 1999 criticality accident, Japanese technology centers had developed nuclear disaster robots, such as the "Remote Surveillance Squad" (Rescue Robots) by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:05:00]</a>. However, due to a lack of budget, these robots received few upgrades after their 2001 completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:10]</a>. Consequently, when the disaster struck ten years later, they were not ready, with many critical components out of stock and no trained operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   JAEA re-engineered a "Rescue" robot into the "JAEA-3" by grafting parts from a Brock robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:47]</a>. It began missions in September 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:51]</a>.

*   **Kinsei Robots and [[challenges_faced_by_robots_in_highradiation_areas | Radiation Hardening]]**
    *   Pakbot's limitations, including radio communication range and difficulty with stairs, prompted Tepco to seek more advanced robots for dose measurement and installing water gauges in the reactor building basement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:06:24]</a>.
    *   Tepco turned to the "Kinsei" series of search and rescue robots developed by the Neato Project at the Chiba Institute of Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:35]</a>. Kinsei robots were designed to be waterproof and highly mobile across difficult terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:49]</a>.
    *   A significant modification requested by Tepco was to harden Kinsei against radioactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:58]</a>. Radiation, including alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, x-rays, and neutron particles, interacts with semiconductor materials in two primary ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:12]</a>:
        *   **Displacement Effect**: Particles like neutrons and alpha particles collide with semiconductors, displacing atoms and altering structural arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:27]</a>. This leads to higher current leakage and decreased device lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:34]</a>.
        *   **Ionization Effect**: Electrons, protons, and x-rays passing through semiconductors create electron-hole pairs, causing permanent glitches and erratic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   Damage can occur at the device, circuit, and system levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:05]</a>. Radiation hardening requires measures at all these levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:08]</a>:
        *   **Device Level**: Modifying transistor layout, adding insulating substrates (e.g., silicon-on-insulator fab), or increasing device size for higher current capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:24]</a>.
        *   **Circuit Level**: Duplicating critical circuits or adding monitoring circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:36]</a>. These protections are generally hardware-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:42]</a>.
        *   **System Level**: Incorporating software benefits, radiation armor, redundancies, and preventive scrubbing algorithms to correct errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:53]</a>.
    *   Testing showed Kinsei's components, including its CPU, motherboard, and motor driver boards, could survive about 200 grays (20,000 rads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:23]</a>. Given initial measurements of about 100 grays at Fukushima, Kinsei was estimated to operate for over 100 hours with a 10% chance of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:35]</a>. The new Kinsei entered reactor buildings in June 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:43]</a>.
    *   After five successful missions, a broken communications link forced the abandonment of the first Kinsei in October 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:52]</a>. Kinsei 2 and 3 were redesigned to fix this flaw and deployed in February 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:57]</a>.

## [[decommissioning_process_of_fukushima | Decommissioning Process of Fukushima]] and Fuel Debris Removal

The Japanese government's long-term goals involve [[decommissioning_process_of_fukushima | decommissioning]] the plant and rebuilding the surrounding area, a multi-step process overseen by Tepco and the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning (IRID) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:15]</a>.

### Site Cleanup
The hydrogen explosions scattered rubble across the site, which needed to be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   "Ashtaco Sora," a heavy-duty robot developed by Hitachi, collects rubble into recycling bins using its two arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   Smaller cleaner robots like "Raccoon" and "Arounder" spray high-pressure water or dry ice to decontaminate areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   "Meister" is a heavy-duty robot capable of drilling for samples or vacuuming particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:52]</a>.

### Spent Fuel Rod Removal
Each unit has a spent fuel assembly for storing fuel no longer used for energy generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   In December 2014, Tepco successfully removed 1,535 spent fuel rods from the damaged unit 4 reactor pool, relocating them to a cooling pool in unit 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   Tepco began removing 566 spent fuel rods from unit 3 in 2019, completing the task by February 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   Removal of spent fuel rods for units 1 and 2 is scheduled to begin in 2023 or later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Melted Fuel Debris (Corium) Inspection and Removal
In units one through three, the nuclear fuel melted down, burning through the reactor pressure vessel and its concrete pedestal, eventually reaching the primary containment vessel (PCV) before being cooled with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:12:02]</a>. This resolidified material, known as corium, needs to be inspected and removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:10]</a>. IRID uses different robots due to the unique circumstances of each reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:18]</a>.

*   **Unit 1**:
    *   The PCV is flooded to a depth of 2 meters, likely with corium at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:25]</a>.
    *   In 2012, Tepco and the team punched a small hole in the PCV for a wired camera and water tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:34]</a>.
    *   In 2014, IRID developed a "P-morph" morphing robot designed to squeeze through a 100 mm hole, then transform into a U-shape to bypass a lead plate used for radiation shielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:49]</a>. An initial P-morph encountered an obstacle, but improvements led to mission completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:13:02]</a>. The next step is to build a robot to collect the pebble-like nuclear fuel debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:08]</a>.

*   **Unit 2**:
    *   Unit 2 suffered a meltdown but no hydrogen explosion, leaving its building structure relatively intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:21]</a>.
    *   Tepco developed a "Scorpion" robot, similar to P-morph, which could crawl through a small hole and reconfigure itself for mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:34]</a>. Deployed in 2017 after extensive clearing, the Scorpion's left tread failed, and it was left inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:48]</a>.
    *   The inside of the reactor was eventually photographed using a camera on what resembled a fishing rod, creating a panorama from multiple shots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:14:00]</a>.
    *   IRID and Tepco plan to begin collecting and removing nuclear fuel debris from Unit 2 first, using a massive stainless steel robotic arm that will reach into the PCV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:15:09]</a>. This project is delayed until 2023 to improve the arm's capabilities and add attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:15]</a>.

*   **Unit 3**:
    *   Corium inside unit 3 was the last to be photographed, as its PCV is almost entirely flooded to a depth of about 6 meters, necessitating new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:13]</a>.
    *   The entrance approach used for unit 2 was not feasible due to flooding, and a robot in 2015 only reached the first-floor grating outside the pedestal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:22]</a>. The best entry point was only 14 centimeters across <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:26]</a>.
    *   It took two years to build a suitable robot for this task, the "Mini Manbo" (little sunfish), which is 13 cm across and 30 cm long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:38]</a>. In 2017, the Mini Manbo successfully recorded video of the nuclear debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:44]</a>.

IRID expects it will take at least 10 years to remove all nuclear fuel debris from the Fukushima site, with further work needed for cleaning and decontamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:29]</a>. While conditions have improved, allowing some residents to return to towns like Kuma, a small percentage have returned, indicating the significant work remaining for both people and robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:51]</a>.

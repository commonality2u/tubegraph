Recently, Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) unveiled its first generation of [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] for commercial use, marking a renewed interest in this technology [00:00:02]. Scientists initially developed [[development_history_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] alongside [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]], but lithium eventually became dominant [00:00:12]. However, concerns regarding raw material supply and [[the_influence_of_patents_on_lfp_battery_development | intellectual property rights]] in the 2000s led to a resurgence of interest in sodium-ion technology starting in the 2010s [00:04:41].

## Basic Structure and Components

[[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | Sodium-ion batteries]] share a similar structure with [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]], consisting of a cathode, an anode, a porous separator, and an electrolyte [00:01:03]. Ions migrate between the cathode and anode when the battery is in use [00:01:13]. The primary difference lies in the specific compounds used for these components [00:01:17]. A significant advantage is that [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | commercial sodium-ion batteries]] can often utilize the same engineering and production methods as [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] [00:01:27].

## Anode Materials

Most studies on sodium-ion batteries have converged on using "hard carbon" for the anodes [00:05:42]. Hard carbon can be colloquially described as charcoal [00:05:49]. [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries | CATL]]'s first-generation battery, for instance, uses a hard carbon anode with a unique porous structure that improves cycle lifetime and allows for more sodium ion movement [00:09:42].

## Electrolyte Materials

The electrolyte facilitates the travel of sodium ions from the anode to the cathode [00:05:53]. Researchers generally choose sodium salts dissolved in organic carbonate solvents for electrolytes, seeking low viscosity, high conductivity, and electrochemical stability [00:06:04].

## Cathode Materials

Significant research has focused on cathode materials because the cathode is the single most expensive component and crucial to the battery's overall viability [00:06:17].

### Sodium Layered Oxides
The most common and studied class of cathode material is sodium layered oxides [00:06:35]. These materials possess a crystalline structure with sheets of metal oxides and sodium ions sandwiched in between [00:06:43]. Their promise stems from their crystalline structures having much in common with lithium cobalt oxide, an early cathode material in lithium-ion batteries [00:07:01].

### Other Research Candidates
Other materials explored for cathodes include sulfides, phosphates, fluorophosphates, carbon phosphates, and vanadium-based polyanionic compounds [00:07:14].

### Prussian White
[[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries | CATL]] has chosen a substance called Prussian white for their cathodes [00:09:55]. Prussian white is an analog of the pigment Prussian blue, first synthesized over 300 years ago [00:10:00].
*   **Properties**: It is very cheap, easily made, and non-toxic [00:10:14].
*   **Battery Suitability**: Researchers noticed its suitability for [[development_history_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion battery]] cathodes in the early 2010s [00:10:19]. Prussian white cathodes exhibit good discharge rates and can maintain capacity over many charge cycles, with some tests showing 95% retention after 10,000 cycles [00:10:25].
*   **Drawback**: A significant drawback is that they lose much of their capacity in the presence of moisture [00:10:38].
*   **Other Adopters**: Other companies exploring Prussian white cathodes include Sweden-based Altris AB and US-based Natron Energy [00:10:46].

## Energy Density and Performance

[[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries | CATL]]'s first-generation [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion battery]] can achieve energy densities of up to 160 watt-hours per kilogram [00:10:55]. This is comparable to an advanced prototype from Washington State University and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory [00:11:02] and competitive with current [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | lithium-ion phosphate (LFP) batteries]] [00:08:43]. [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries | CATL]]'s second generation aims for over 200 watt-hours per kilogram [00:11:11].

However, sodium has a lower ionization potential than lithium, meaning [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] will inherently have lower energy densities and operating voltages than their lithium counterparts [00:08:50]. It is uncertain if they can ever match top-line [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] in this regard [00:09:02]. Despite this, [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] show potential for short-range [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles and_energy_storage | electric vehicles]] and, especially, [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles and_energy_storage | stationary power systems]] where space is less of a concern, making their lower energy density less of a confounding factor [00:13:07].

## Production Integration and Cost Implications

Since the engineering and manufacturing processes for [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | sodium-ion]] and [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] are similar [00:11:18], companies like [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries | CATL]] can integrate their [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion offerings]] into existing [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion infrastructure]] and product ecosystems [00:11:23].

While shared processes exist, [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | sodium-ion battery costs]] will not be drastically lower than [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] [00:11:39]. Most savings will come from the significantly cheaper raw material costs [00:11:45]. Raw sodium costs $150 per ton compared to lithium's $5,000 per ton, a 30-times decrease [00:02:11]. One paper estimates that end users may see 10% to 30% [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | price savings]] with [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]], all else being equal [00:11:53].

Furthermore, [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries | CATL]] has highlighted battery system integration capabilities, allowing for the combination of [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | sodium-ion]] and [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] into a single system [00:12:03]. In such systems, the higher energy density [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] are automatically used when [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | sodium-ion]] falls short [00:12:12].

## Historical Context: Molten Salt Batteries

Early [[development_history_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion battery development]] in the early 20th century focused on molten salts capable of conducting high amounts of sodium ions [00:02:25].

*   **Sodium-Sulfur Battery (Ford, 1968)**: Scientists at Ford developed the [[development_history_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-sulfur battery]] for use in [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles and_energy_storage | electric vehicles]] [00:02:33]. It consisted of metallic sodium and liquid sulfur tubes [00:02:40]. Ford believed a 350-pound battery could provide 200-300 miles of range for a 1,350-pound car at 40 miles per hour, with a minimum charge time of half an hour [00:02:45].
    *   **Challenge**: The primary challenge was its operational temperature of 570-660 degrees Fahrenheit (300-350 degrees Celsius) [00:03:00]. These high temperatures led to safety and longevity issues, such as aluminum-based container tubes reacting with battery chemicals and rupturing [00:03:10].
    *   **Commercialization**: Ford never commercialized the technology for electric vehicles [00:03:24].
    *   **Modern Applications**: Molten salt batteries have not seen wide use in mobile electronics [00:03:30] but are used to power missile guidance systems and are ideal for extreme environments [00:03:35]. Ford eventually sold this technology to the Japanese company NGK, which now sells them as stationary battery solutions for peak energy use and grid stabilization [00:03:51].
*   **Zebra Battery (South Africa, 1985)**: The oil crises of the 1970s revitalized interest in this technology [00:04:01]. South African researchers created a new version of the molten salt battery using nickel chloride and sodium tetrachloroaluminate, known as the Zebra battery [00:04:06]. This held promise, but in 1989, Sony successfully [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | commercialized the lithium-ion battery]], which quickly dominated the industry [00:04:18].

Research on sodium-ion batteries largely shifted back to room-temperature operation starting in the 2010s, leading to a rapid increase in related publications [00:05:15].

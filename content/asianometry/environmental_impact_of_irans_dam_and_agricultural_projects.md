Iran faces a long-running water crisis, stemming from its historically arid climate and low rainfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Much of its central lands are uninhabitable without water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Over the years, the country developed a vast industrial water system to support agriculture and a growing population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, which ultimately contributed to its current water challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Iran's Arid Climate and Limited Water Resources

Iran is naturally dry, ranking 158th out of 189 countries for annual average precipitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
Key precipitation statistics:
*   75% of precipitation falls on just 25% of the country's area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   50% of rainfall occurs during winter months, with only 4% in summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   Central deserts receive less than 50 millimeters of rainfall annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

While Iran borders the Caspian Sea (the world's largest inland body of water) to the north and the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman to the south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, these provide limited usable water. The Caspian Sea water is brackish and requires desalination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, and the southern water basin, while holding nearly half of Iran's renewable water resources, covers only a quarter of its land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Snowmelt from mountains creates several large rivers, but most are seasonal, often drying up in summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Similarly, most of Iran's 10 lakes are very salty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Ultimately, less than 1% of Iran's 1.6 million square kilometers is surface water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## [[irans_historical_water_management_and_its_evolution | Evolution of Water Management]]

Historically, Iran's aridity necessitated sophisticated water management. Around 3,000 years ago, ancient Persians pioneered the "qanat" system, an underground tunnel that used gravity to bring snowmelt water from mountains to plains, sometimes over tens of kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Qanats prevented evaporation and allowed water storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This prudent management enabled the Achaemenid Empire's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. By the 1700s, over 500 qanats supplied Tehran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, and by the 1900s, Iran had built over 270,000 kilometers of underground qanat tunnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Shift to Modern Systems and Decline of Qanats

In the 20th century, population growth outpaced qanat capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. After World War I, Reza Shah Pahlavi's government modernized the country, settling nomadic populations who then required consistent water sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Iran turned to hydraulic mega-projects like dams and irrigation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Modern water wells, first built in 1915, quickly gained popularity due to their speed and ease compared to labor-intensive qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Authorities promoted these new systems, leading qanats to fall into disrepair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. By 1950, qanats supplied only 50% of the country's water, down from 75% in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

The 1963 "White Revolution" land reform further impacted qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Landlords, who previously paid for qanat maintenance, no longer did so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. New centralized authorities, like the Ministry of Water and Power (established 1964), largely neglected qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. By 2000, less than 10% of Iran's water came from qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Agricultural Expansion and Water Use

With only 10.5% of its land arable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, Iran built dams and pumped groundwater to irrigate land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This industrial-level water management expanded irrigated lands from 8,000 square kilometers in 1968 to 22,662 square kilometers in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

After the Islamic Revolution, trade restrictions and the Iran-Iraq War fueled a drive for food self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This coincided with rapid population growth, averaging 1 million people per year over three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. By late 2022, Iran's population reached 88.5 million, more than quadrupling since 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. To feed this population, crop production grew 175% from 1980 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, with wheat, barley, and rice being major crops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

Agriculture accounts for 93% of all water used in Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. The government heavily subsidized water and fertilizer costs for farmers, encouraging inefficient use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:11:03]</a>. Iran's average irrigation efficiency is under 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, largely because over 70% of land is surface irrigated, leading to substantial water loss through evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Despite these efforts, Iran remains short of complete food self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

## Environmental Impacts of Modern Water Management

The Iranian government's strategy has focused on growing water supply rather than cutting demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, leading to significant environmental consequences.

### Dam Building and Its Effects

Iran has become one of the world's biggest dam-building countries, with over 588 large and small dams and about 100 more under construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. While dams provide water reservoirs and hydroelectric power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, years of water impoundment can severely damage the environment. For instance, the Upper Gotvand Dam, completed in 2012, has accumulated over 66.5 million tons of salt in its reservoir, raising salinity levels in surrounding agricultural soils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

The government is also building high-profile desalination plants on the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf to meet urban water demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. However, transporting this water to central cities is expensive, and it is not economically viable for agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. This also raises [[environmental_concerns_of_desalination | Environmental Concerns of Desalination]].

### Surface Water Depletion

Increased agricultural demand and development have severely drained Iran's surface water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>:

*   **Lake Urmia**: Once Iran's and the Middle East's largest lake, it has shrunk aggressively due to persistent drought and water mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. A bridge project completed in the early 2000s exacerbated its decline by cutting the lake in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Today, Lake Urmia is a tenth of its former size, and its dry bed causes massive salt storms that ruin nearby farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **Hamoun Lake**: Eastern Iran's largest freshwater body, located on the border with Afghanistan, is naturally seasonal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. However, during a severe drought in 2001, it vanished entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. The dry lake bed led to large dust storms, a serious health hazard, necessitating the evacuation of 124 surrounding villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

### [[groundwater_overextraction_and_its_consequences_in_iran | Groundwater Overextraction]]

Groundwater has become Iran's primary water source, accounting for 55% of total supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. A 2021 Nature study estimated that over 74 cubic kilometers of water were extracted from Iran's wells between 2002 and 2015 alone, equivalent to the 34th largest freshwater lake globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:17:07]</a>. While groundwater drilling should be regulated, there is little enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. The number of wells in Iran surged from 47,000 in 1979 to 789,000 in 2013, with almost all being illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

Consequences of declining groundwater levels:
*   **Increased Salinity**: Soil and groundwater become saltier. Electrical conductivity measurements of soil in areas like the Karkheh Basin (a major agricultural area) are 85% higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
*   **Land Subsidence**: The ground literally sinks, with Iran's land shrinking at an average of about 6 centimeters per year, reaching 19 centimeters in some areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Subsidence damages infrastructure such as transmission lines, bridges, and buildings, and undermines structural safety, especially during earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
*   **Permanent Aquifer Damage**: Subsidence can permanently damage the aquifer's capacity to carry water, making recovery impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

## Conclusion: [[challenges_and_reforms_needed_in_irans_water_management_system | Challenges and Reforms]]

While Iran's large population contributes to the water problem, the core issue is demand and mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. Difficult decisions are necessary regarding water usage in homes, industry, and especially agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Implementing these reforms is challenging for a populist government, particularly given [[effects_of_climate_change_and_drought_on_irans_water_resources | climate change and a turbulent political situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. However, the long-term costs of current water mismanagement are heavy, necessitating substantial reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

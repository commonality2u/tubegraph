Methamphetamine, originally discovered by a Japanese scientist, gained significant, though not widespread, use before and during World War II in Japan, particularly within its military forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Discovery and Properties
In 1885, [[dr_nagayoshi_nagai_and_the_discovery_of_methamphetamine | Dr. Nagayoshi Nagai]], one of the first Japanese scientists to train abroad, isolated one of the four forms of ephedrine from the Chinese herb ephedra (ma Huang), known for its traditional medicinal uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40">[01:40]</a>. He then synthesized methamphetamine in 1893, naming it "m33n" as it was his 33rd extract from the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50">[01:50]</a>. Initially, few paid attention to this discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56">[01:56]</a>. Decades later, in 1919, Akira Ogata, one of Nagai's students, synthesized a more potent variant known as crystal meth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59">[01:59]</a>.

Crystal meth rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier, triggering a release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, which induces feelings of well-being, and norepinephrine, which prepares the brain for "fight or flight" responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12">[02:12]</a>. This results in a quick rush of energy and euphoria that can last 8 to 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34">[02:34]</a>. However, excessive use can lead to hallucinations, delusions, and sleeplessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43">[02:43]</a>. Withdrawal symptoms include decreased energy, anxiety, irritability, and disrupted sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52">[02:52]</a>.

## Early Medical and Commercial Use
Initially, meth was used in Japan as a cough suppressant or bronchodilator for asthmatics, and occasionally for patients suffering from depression and lethargy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12">[03:12]</a>. It was not widely popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24">[03:24]</a>.

In 1938, after the German Army adopted methamphetamine (Pervitin) for its stimulant effects, Japanese researchers, including Kenosuke Miora, encouraged the government to follow suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26">[03:26]</a>. Miora's Dai Nippon Pharmaceutical Company produced the most popular meth brand, Philopon (or Hiropon), introduced in 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44">[03:44]</a>. The name "Philopon" literally means "loving labor" and became synonymous with all stimulants for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55">[03:55]</a>.

In 1941, the Japanese government approved the commercial sale of both amphetamine and methamphetamine without limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02">[04:02]</a>. These drugs were marketed as "Awakening drugs" or "wakeamines," with advertisements promoting them for "night work and other times demanding mental alertness" and "over exertion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12">[04:12]</a>.

## Military Adoption During World War II
As World War II progressed, the Japanese military extensively adopted methamphetamine for the war effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28">[04:28]</a>:
*   **Sentries** on nighttime duty received a special meth tablet called the "cat eye tablet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33">[04:33]</a>.
*   **Munitions factory workers** received tablets to facilitate working through the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39">[04:39]</a>.
*   **Kamikaze pilots** and other special forces were given a "storming tablet," a meth tablet mixed with green tea powder and stamped with the emperor's crest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46">[04:46]</a>.
*   **Air pilots** were reportedly given meth injections, told they were "nighttime vision hormones" imported from Germany, though post-war records suggest these were likely melanotropins extracted from cows and pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03">[05:03]</a>.

Methamphetamine was widely used throughout the military complex, almost always in tablet form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56">[04:56]</a>. The military stockpiled large quantities of these drugs, referring to them as a "Mainland decisive battle weapon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18">[05:18]</a>. Despite this, Japan ultimately lost the war, suggesting that meth did not aid in victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22">[05:22]</a>.

## Post-War Aftermath
The war's end left Japan in ruin and chaos, with widespread joblessness and food shortages, exacerbated by the return of millions of soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29">[05:29]</a>. Many Japanese turned to alcohol and drugs to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43">[05:43]</a>. The drugs fueling the subsequent [[japans_postwar_methamphetamine_crisis | post-war meth crisis]] came from three main sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56">[05:56]</a>:
1.  **Pharmaceutical companies** dumped huge post-war supplies into the civilian market, believing they were aiding in national rebuilding and aiming to make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58">[05:58]</a>. Meth was often cheaper than alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17">[06:17]</a>.
2.  **Military stockpiles** leaked out, despite efforts by American post-occupation forces to seize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22">[06:22]</a>. Many caches remained scattered across islands, hospitals, supply depots, and caves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44">[06:44]</a>.
3.  **Informal markets and crime gangs** diverted drugs through corrupt servicemen and street gangs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53">[06:53]</a>. Methamphetamine, referred to as "Shabu," was easily manufactured in small labs with ingredients from Hong Kong pharmacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03">[07:03]</a>.

Many returning soldiers simply took their pills home, unaware of the hazardous side effects, believing them harmless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16">[07:16]</a>. This lack of awareness, coupled with the abundant supply and terrible economic conditions, contributed to the escalating post-war crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30">[07:30]</a>.

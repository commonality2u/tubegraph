In the 1960s, as the [[economic_history_of_the_Soviet_Union | Soviet economy]] faced stagnation and a desperate need for reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, a radical idea emerged: a single, nationwide computer network known as OGAS (Obshchegosudarstvennaya Avtomatizirovannaya Sistema, or All-State Automated System for the Management of the Economy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. This ambitious project, often referred to as the "Soviet internet," was envisioned as the nervous system for the entire nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, designed to autonomously gather and process data from all factories and command production as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Despite its promise to usher in a tech-led future, this vision never materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Soviet Command Economy: Context for Reform

For much of its history, the Soviet Union operated a command economy where the state owned virtually everything, and economic activity was coordinated through directives, quotas, and commands rather than a free market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Key state entities included:
*   **Gosplan (State Planning Commission)**: Responsible for writing five-year plans and defining economic inputs, including prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Gossnab (State Commission for Materials and Equipment Supplier)**: Tasked with implementing the plans by procuring and supplying producer goods to factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Gosbank**: Handled accounting and transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Initially, this command economy facilitated rapid growth, especially in military and aerospace sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. However, behind the scenes, the centralized planning system struggled with immense paperwork, distorted incentives, and frequent miscommunications, often failing to properly assign quotas or redistribute outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Many quotas were only met through an informal network of "pushers" who acted as fixers, navigating the clogged formal channels through unofficial negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Attempts at reform often exacerbated the bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Cybernetics and Khrushchev's Embrace

The death of Stalin in 1953 ushered in a new era, with Nikita Khrushchev taking leadership from 1953 to 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Khrushchev initiated a series of reforms, including the normalization and adoption of cybernetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. At the 20th Congress of the Communist Party in 1956, he praised cybernetics as a "major tool of the creation of a communist Society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a> and encouraged the development of computer science and industrial automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Previously banned during Stalin's reign due to assertions that information was a substance of its own and analogies between the brain and computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, Khrushchev's reversal allowed cybernetics to flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Soviet cybernetics evolved into a project focused on introducing mathematical methods to life and social sciences, imbuing it with an "aura of Truth and objectivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Soviets became convinced that computers could provide a universal method for problem-solving, potentially applicable to their ailing economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Military Precedent and Early Networking Concepts

News of the American Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system in 1958, a groundbreaking air defense network coordinating radar data, deeply alarmed Soviet military planners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. SAGE, powered by the largest computer ever built at the time, cost more than the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. In response, the Soviets developed their own centralized computer networks for air defense, missile defense, and space surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The air defense network, "System A," boasted capabilities like hitting a "fly in outer space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, connecting supercomputers like the M40 and M50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This military success demonstrated the potential of networked computers for civilian applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Anatoli Kitov's Vision

Anatoli Kitov, an early pioneer in Soviet cybernetics, proposed the first national networking effort in 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Having read Norbert Weiner's seminal work, Kitov concluded that cybernetics held "high potential for the Soviet Union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> and authored the country's first positive article on the subject, "The Main Features of Cybernetics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

In 1956, Kitov wrote a book outlining how computers could model and regulate the Soviet economy, replacing existing tabulating machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. In January 1959, he wrote to the Communist Party Central Committee, urging the adoption of computers for economic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. His first letter also likely proposed a "unified State network of computing centers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. While Khrushchev likely didn't see it, government officials supported his proposals, except for the network aspect, instead adopting a resolution to speed up computer production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

Buoyed by this, Kitov pushed further in late 1959, proposing the installation of large computers at local factories and government agencies, linked together into "automated systems of management" (ASUS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Ultimately, he envisioned a "unified automated management system" for the entire nation, both military and civilian, called the "economic automatic management system" (EASU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This system would use powerful, underground military computers accessible via terminals for data submission and processing, maximizing the command economy's centralization advantages and replacing much of the bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

However, Kitov's "red letter" also criticized Ministry of Defense leaders for slow computer adoption and suggested sharing military technology with civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. This led to a show trial where he lost his job, Communist Party membership, and military honors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Though not executed, Kitov spent the rest of his life advocating for a networked Soviet future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## The Rise of OGAS and Glushkov's Efforts

Despite Kitov's setback, the idea of networking persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. In the West, concepts of shared computing power emerged, such as GE's time-sharing service and American Airlines' SABRE reservation network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. In the Soviet Union, cyberneticists like Alexander Kharkevich proposed a national unified communications network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

The most prominent figure to champion this cause was Victor Glushkov, head of the Kiev Institute of Cybernetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. He aimed to create the ASUS systems Kitov had described, even hiring Kitov as a consultant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. In late 1962, Glushkov wrote to Khrushchev, highlighting the growing technology gap with the West and advocating for accelerated Soviet computerization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. In 1963, Soviet leadership approved research into economic reform using these automated computer networks (ASUS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

ASUS allowed mainframe computers to receive and process information from factories, resembling local network factory automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Glushkov's team successfully demonstrated computer control of a steel smelting factory 300 miles away and a carbonization process 400 miles away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

Glushkov's ambitions extended beyond factory automation, leading to the emergence of OGAS, a shortened abbreviation for the "All-State Automated System for the Management of the Economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

### The OGAS Vision

As conceived in the early 1960s, OGAS was a highly ambitious three-tiered hierarchy:
*   **Tier 1**: 20,000 computer terminals and ASUS systems at the local level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Tier 2**: 100 to 200 mid-level regional planning decision systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Tier 3**: Rolled up to a central planner in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

Glushkov even proposed computerization of currencies and a moneyless system of receipts, a concept likely designed to appeal to Khrushchev's Marxist ideals, though it was later dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. The vision driving OGAS was a single computer network that would "rationally and automatically plan, optimize, and produce the country's National economy as dictated by the Party Center" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. It aimed to plan every bureaucrat's work, providing detailed lists of duties and timetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

OGAS was imagined as the "nervous system" connecting the factories and workers (the "body") to the Soviet leadership (the "brain"), allowing for coordinated output and eliminating bureaucratic inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This system would have been the Soviet counterpoint to the Western capitalist view of a self-regulating market economy, using historical data for rational forecasts and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## Why OGAS Never Fully Launched

The original 1964 vision of OGAS faced insurmountable obstacles:
*   **Cost**: The project was estimated to take 30 years and cost 160 billion rubles (approximately 1.4 trillion USD in 2016 dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, exceeding the combined cost of the Soviet space and atomic bomb programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Technological Lag**: While Soviet military computers had "World leading capabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, civilian computer [[soviet_versus_western_computing_capabilities | technology lagged far behind]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. The military was also unwilling to transfer its specialized technology to civilian use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   **Bureaucratic Resistance**: Various players, including Communist Party bureaucrats, Gosplan, and industrial managers, objected to the idea of being replaced or dictated to by a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. The Central Statistical Administration feared the "objective collection of data" would curb their power to control information flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

Furthermore, Glushkov's plans were "all or nothing," requiring a "complete Reformation of the country's management system" to realize its benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

### Shifting Political Sands and Iterations

In 1964, Khrushchev lost power, replaced by Leonid Brezhnev, who reversed many of his predecessor's economic reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. However, the directive for economic restructuring via computer remained on the agenda due to high-level backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Gosplan and the Central Statistical Administration rejected OGAS's "utopian Vision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>, leading to infighting over control of its resources. For OGAS to be implemented, it had to conform to the existing Soviet way of doing things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

In 1969, widespread news of ARPANET, the predecessor to today's internet, caught Soviet leadership by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, providing a competitive impetus for the OGAS project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Glushkov adapted the OGAS concept: instead of controlling the entire economy, it would function as a "universal information Bank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, organizing and controlling data flows between national agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>, much like a system of canals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

At a momentous Politburo meeting on October 1, 1970, Glushkov presented his revised OGAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. While several higher-ups spoke positively and hardliners remained silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, the Ministry of Finance, Vasily Garbuzov, interceded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. Fearing the erosion of his ministry's power, he dismissed OGAS as a "silly project" and proposed a more conservative counter-proposal that won over the Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

As a result, the full OGAS proposal was neither fully accepted nor rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. Throughout the 1970s, some individual ASUS systems were built in factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>, but they were built haphazardly and without standardization, making a nationwide unified network impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

### Conclusion: The Real Reasons for Failure

The proximate cause for the failure of the [[challenges_and_bureaucratic_infighting_in_implementing_soviet_internet | Soviet internet]] was [[challenges_and_bureaucratic_infighting_in_implementing_soviet_internet | bureaucratic infighting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>, as various power centers objected to its capabilities and hijacked the project for their own ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. However, the fundamental reason OGAS never took off was its direct challenge to the existing [[impact_of_centralized_planning_on_technology | centralized planning on technology | how the Soviet Union ran things]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. An invention cannot be separated from its context, and the Soviet Union itself was only a couple of decades away from implosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. The [[soviet_computer_development_history | Soviet computer development history]] and its [[challenges_in_soviet_computer_production | challenges in Soviet computer production]] illustrate the broader [[strategic_decisions_in_soviet_computing_industry | strategic decisions in Soviet computing industry]] and the [[rise_and_decline_of_soviet_economic_strategies | rise and decline of Soviet economic strategies]], where [[soviet_industrial_growth_and_technological_lag | industrial growth and technological lag]] were deeply intertwined with bureaucratic structures.

On February 17, 1979, the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China began shelling the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, with 100,000 PLA troops crossing the border shortly thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This [[sinovietnamese_war_overview | military invasion]] came despite shared Marxist ideologies and previous statements by Ho Chi Minh affirming China and Vietnam as comrades and brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. China had also played a crucial role in helping Vietnam eject the imperialist French and Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This conflict was the result of a long history of escalating offenses and disagreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Centuries of Complexities

Vietnam and China have maintained a conflicted and complex relationship for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This history includes a period of nearly 1,000 years of Chinese colonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Additionally, Vietnam experienced a 20-year invasion by the Ming Dynasty in the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, contributing to inherent tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

From the Vietnamese perspective, Chinese intentions were often not pure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The Chinese viewed Vietnam as a junior partner rather than an equal, growing agitated whenever the Vietnamese asserted their independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Post-Vietnam War Tensions

The relationship between Vietnam and China had been increasingly strained ever since the reunification of Vietnam by the Vietnamese Communist Party at the end of the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Chinese Aid and Conditions

During the war effort against the United States, China provided significant aid and resources to Vietnam, valued at nearly $20 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. However, this assistance came with a crucial condition: Vietnam was prohibited from accepting any aid from the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Conversely, the Chinese were angered by what they perceived as Hanoi's lack of gratitude for the aid provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. These sentiments, combined with escalating border clashes and explosions involving ethnic Chinese in Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, led China under Deng Xiaoping to believe that Vietnam had become "too big for their britches" and deserved a "lesson for their insolence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This reinforced the Vietnamese notion that China would perpetually treat them as a junior partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Shifting Alliances

The increasingly strained relationship was further complicated by the Chinese Communist Party's desire to improve relations with the West and distance itself from the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. At this time, China viewed the Soviet Union as its primary foreign policy threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The [[sinosoviet_relations_and_treaty_of_friendship | Sino-Soviet Split]] had been ongoing, stemming from disputes such as Mao's disagreements with Khrushchev's denouncement of Stalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Soviet attempts at thawing relations were met with distrust by China, especially given the continued positioning of major Soviet military forces and live ammunition exercises at the Soviet-Chinese borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

Sri Lanka's [[historical_economic_development_of_sri_lanka | economic development]] has been extensively studied, with recent events adding a challenging new chapter to its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Following the end of its civil war in 2009, the country experienced a period of significant economic growth driven primarily by debt-fueled public sector construction and [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources | infrastructure]] projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. However, this growth proved to be unsustainable, leading to increased fiscal deficits and a fragile economy vulnerable to external shocks.

## Post-Civil War Economic Boom (2009-2014)

After the civil war concluded in 2009, the five years that followed saw the Sri Lankan economy growing at a robust pace of about 7% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
During this period:
*   The stock market boomed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   Per capita income rose significantly from approximately $1,000 in 2004 to $3,200 by 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
*   Inflation dropped from 22% in 2008 to 3.17% in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   Unemployment halved from 8% in 2004 to 4% in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   Poverty rates declined from 15% to 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

By 2019, Sri Lanka had attained upper middle-income country status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

## Unhealthy Growth and Rising Debt

Despite the seemingly positive statistics, the underlying drivers of this economic boom were not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
A significant portion of the GDP increase (70% from 2004 to 2013) stemmed from debt-fueled major public sector construction and [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources | infrastructure]] projects, rather than labor-intensive manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

### Fiscal Deficits and Debt Accumulation
Sri Lanka has consistently run fiscal deficits and has frequently breached deficit reduction agreements with the IMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. The country's annual debt-to-GDP ratios have steadily increased since 2012, reaching a 10-year high of nearly 87% in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. This was exacerbated by massive tax cuts introduced by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

### Mega-Infrastructure Projects
Notable [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources | infrastructure]] projects include the massive Colombo Port City project, envisioned as a "city of the future" built on reclaimed land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. This project, part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, had a budget exceeding $15 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

While debt can be beneficial if invested productively, the economic viability of these projects was questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. For instance, the Colombo Port City is located in the south, far from Sri Lanka's war-torn northern and eastern provinces, but close to the government's political power base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Concerns about corruption also emerged, with billions of dollars in no-bid contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

#### Chinese Debt
Despite claims of "Chinese debt trap diplomacy," only about 10% of Sri Lanka's total debt is owed to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. The vast majority of its debt is owed to international bond markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

## Shift Away from Traditional Economic Drivers
The emphasis on [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources | infrastructure]] development came at the expense of Sri Lanka's traditional economic drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Manufacturing's share of GDP peaked at nearly 20% in the early 2000s but subsequently declined to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. The manufacturing that did grow focused on the domestic sector (e.g., food, beverage, tobacco) rather than export-oriented industries like garments or electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. This contrasts with nations like Vietnam, which later embarked on their manufacturing push and surpassed Sri Lanka in global market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

## Reduced Economic Resiliency
The shift towards debt-funded [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources | infrastructure]] and an increased reliance on remittances from migrant workers reduced Sri Lanka's economic resiliency against external shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Remittances became a significant economic driver, representing 6-8% of the country's economy and its second-biggest earner of foreign income after exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. In 2019, remittances covered over 85% of the country's foreign exchange shortfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

## Consequences
This economic structure made Sri Lanka particularly vulnerable to unforeseen events, such as the [[impact_of_the_covid19_pandemic_on_sri_lankas_economic_crisis | COVID-19 pandemic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. The pandemic significantly impacted foreign exchange earners, including garment, tea, and rubber exports, as well as remittances and tourism, all of which experienced sharp declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This exacerbated existing fragilities, contributing to domestic shortages, power cuts, rationing, and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. The Sri Lankan Rupee experienced a substantial drop in value against the US dollar, worsened by extensive money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.

The economic hardship was a long time coming, with COVID-19 providing the final push for a country that had been on the brink for a significant period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. The path out of the crisis necessitates coherent political leadership, debt restructuring, economic reform, and improved relations between the government and its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

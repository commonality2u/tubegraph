The [[development_of_thermonuclear_weapons | hydrogen bomb]], a staged thermonuclear weapon, possessed terrifying destructive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Its emergence and development profoundly impacted the dynamics of the [[impact_of_cold_war_technology_race_on_computing | Cold War]].

## The Escalating Arms Race

The United States accelerated its development of the hydrogen bomb in response to the first Soviet atomic bomb test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Remarkably, the Soviets achieved their own H-bomb just three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While [[role_of_espionage_in_soviet_and_american_nuclear_programs | Soviet spycraft]] aided their initial atomic bomb efforts, their H-bomb development was largely an independent scientific achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

After World War II, the United States briefly held a nuclear monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. However, this monopoly ended with the successful Soviet atomic bomb test (RDS-1) in August 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. This event significantly altered the geopolitical landscape, as the US leadership not only realized the end of their advantage but also doubted their ability to predict the speed of the Soviet nuclear program's progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

In response to the Soviet atomic bomb, U.S. President Truman ordered the accelerated [[development_of_thermonuclear_weapons | development of the superbomb]] in January 1950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>, a decision that made headlines globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. This immediately spurred the Soviets to intensify their own efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

## Soviet Drive for the "Superbomb"

Even before the first Soviet atomic test, Soviet scientists were receiving intelligence reports about the American "Classical Super" design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The idea of a "superbomb" gained traction in October 1945 after Professor Marcus Oliphant's remarks were reported, suggesting the possibility of a 2-megaton TNT-equivalent bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Although figures like Niels Bohr expressed skepticism about a "superbomb," American intelligence reports convinced the Soviets to pursue the idea, as they felt they were already behind in atomic bomb technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

Soviet leaders, including Stalin and Lavrenty Beria, the head of the NKVD, were alarmed by the perceived advanced progress of the Americans and pushed for the acceleration of alternative nuclear bomb designs like the H-bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Unlike in the United States, there was no internal debate in the Soviet Union about whether to proceed with a bigger bomb once they had the atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

## The Layer Cake (RDS-6s) and Pressure to Perform

The Soviet "Layer Cake" design (RDS-6s), developed by Andrei Sakharov and his team, was a "boosted" fission bomb that also harnessed nuclear fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Its first prototype detonation was scheduled for August 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. The period leading up to this test was marked by intense tension, with both superpowers vying for nuclear supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

In November 1952, the U.S. detonated Ivy Mike, the first test of a staged thermonuclear device, based on the Teller-Ulam design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Despite its immense size (70 tons, the size of a two-story house) and impracticality as a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>, it demonstrated the potential for massive yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. This put immense pressure on Soviet scientists to deliver a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Beria reportedly threatened scientists with prison if they failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

On August 8th, 1953, Soviet official Georgy Malenkov publicly declared that the United States would not have a thermonuclear monopoly, further increasing the stakes for the scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Four days later, the RDS-6s (dubbed Joe-4 by the U.S.) was successfully detonated, yielding 400 kilotons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Crucially, unlike Ivy Mike, the RDS-6s was small enough to be deployed as a practical weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

## Achieving Parity and a New Stage of Rivalry

While the Layer Cake had limitations in scaling its yield, the Soviets soon independently developed the "Third Idea" of [[development_of_thermonuclear_weapons | radiation implosion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, similar to the American Teller-Ulam design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. This led to the creation of RDS-37, which was detonated on November 22nd, 1955, with a yield of 1.6 megatons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

The successful detonation of RDS-37 marked the Soviet Union's achievement of a true hydrogen bomb, establishing parity with the United States far faster than anticipated in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Although analyzing fallout from U.S. tests like Ivy Mike may have indicated the possibility of massive yields, Soviet scientists lacked the technical capability to decipher the exact design secrets from radiological measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. The awareness that such massive weapons were indeed possible was often enough to drive further development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

Soviet scientists expressed immense pride in their rapid achievement, believing their work prevented a nuclear war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. The rivalry between the two superpowers, now both possessing thermonuclear weapons, entered a new, more precarious stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. This ongoing arms race, fueled by mutual development, shaped the strategic landscape of the Cold War, emphasizing deterrence through mutually assured destruction.

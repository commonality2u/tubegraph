Hong Kong's [[deindustrialization_and_its_impact_on_hong_kongs_economy | demanufacturing]] of its economy, specifically the loss of its electronics manufacturing industry, is considered by some to be a significant mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This shift illustrates what happens when an entire economy loses its ability to produce tangible goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Rise of Manufacturing in Hong Kong

After the Chinese Civil War, Shanghai industrialists and refugees relocated to Hong Kong to escape the Communist Party of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. These industrialists brought capital and manufacturing expertise, re-establishing factories in their new home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. They sought to leverage the labor opportunities provided by an estimated 1 million poor Chinese migrants squatting in Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Due to limited land, even then, Hong Kong's factories produced lightly manufactured items from high-rise buildings, such as plastic flowers, clothes, and radio assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The timing was fortuitous, as the United States and other Western countries began outsourcing manufactured goods from Asia in the 1950s, a trend that intensified over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. By the early 1960s, Hong Kong became the single largest manufacturer in the developing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. These low-skilled jobs enabled many people to earn a living and build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Challenges to Manufacturing

However, [[impact_of_competition_from_china_and_other_asian_economies_on_hong_kong | competition quickly emerged]] from places like South Korea and Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. As workers' salaries improved, costs rose, and newer generations of Hong Kongers desired a richer lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Hong Kong's manufacturing industries had little to offer beyond cheap labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The city's economy lacked the technological expertise to produce native technologies for critical components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. For example, in electronics, Hong Kong's Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) spent 60% of their cost budget on integrated circuits imported from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

This resulted in an uncompetitive industry, leading manufacturers to request government assistance for technological upgrades as early as 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. In contrast, governments in Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea were investing millions to acquire and "naturalize" their own technologies for commercial use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Economic History and Policies During British Colonial Rule

Hong Kong's [[economic_history_and_policies_during_british_colonial_rule_in_hong_kong | economic history during British colonial rule]] was unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The British colonial administration likely intended Hong Kong to be no more than a small trading post connecting China and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. An early fiscal compromise involved no import or export taxes, with the government generating revenue primarily from land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The government held superior title to all land, leasing it to private parties for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This created an economy centered on ever-rising land prices, trading, and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

By 1949, Hong Kong's largest companies were banks, land development firms, and trading houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Many former industrialists, such as Li Ka-shing, had already closed their factories to become landlords, finding it more profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. These powerful companies saw no reason for government intervention on behalf of the manufacturing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, leading the Hong Kong government to maintain a non-interventionist stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## The Shift to a Service Economy

Manufacturing largely moved to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This resulted in a massive loss of lower and middle-income jobs in Hong Kong, and the city significantly increased its focus on finance and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Hong Kong ceased primarily making and exporting goods, instead concentrating on serving as a value-added intermediary for handling investments and cargo between China and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Hong Kong's British heritage, English language, laws, and pro-business attitudes facilitated this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

The service industry's contribution to Hong Kong's GDP dramatically increased:
*   **1980**: 68% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
*   **2000**: 86.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>
*   **2019**: 93.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>

Construction remains the second largest sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Hong Kong is now primarily a service economy, producing little beyond the efforts of its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Hong Kong Chief Executives, such as Tung Chee-hwa and Donald Tsang, did not attempt to reverse the [[the_impact_of_globalization_and_manufacturing_shifts | demanufacturing trend]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Instead, they promoted the idea that Hong Kong benefits most from the free flow of capital and trade between China and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Growing Competition and Declining Relevance

The challenge with this view is that as China reforms and opens up, Hong Kong's service economy model becomes less beneficial for its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The Pearl River region has become a major logistics and transport hub <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, and Shanghai has increasingly absorbed many of Hong Kong's service economy functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Mainland Chinese cities have reformed financial restrictions, allowing foreign capital to flow directly into their ports and logistics networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Hong Kong's share of China's trade with the rest of the world has declined significantly:
*   **1997**: 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
*   **2007**: 28% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
*   **2020**: 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>

With transport, trade, and logistics declining, the financial services sector has been the only significant growth area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Its contribution to the Hong Kong economy increased from 18% in 2000 to nearly 30% in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. However, even this sector faces increasing competition as China lifts foreign ownership restrictions in its investing and banking markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. In 2020, China allowed foreign banks, securities firms, and fund management firms to fully own their Chinese subsidiaries, enabling direct offering of financial products to Chinese consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. For example, BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager, began offering wholly-owned mutual funds in China in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Challenges for Young People and the Labor Market

The shift has significant implications for [[challenges_facing_young_people_and_the_labor_market_in_hong_kong | young Hong Kongers]] seeking wealth and economic security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Historically, buying a house was a pathway to wealth, but Hong Kong property prices are now exorbitant, far outpacing wage growth, making homeownership unattainable for most young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

The Hong Kong government's inability to address housing prices is tacitly acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>:
*   The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar since 1983, removing interest rate control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   Much undeveloped land is controlled by large land development monopolies like Sun Hung Kai Properties and CK Hutchison Holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   Attempts at housing price reform in the 1990s failed and were rolled back after the 1997 Asian financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   Public spending for housing as a percentage of GDP has not increased since 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

The government's current policy vision is to encourage "labor flexibility" for high-tech industries and wealth accumulation through investment in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. However, there are significant issues with this approach:
1.  **Job Creation**: The financial sector, even with Chinese IPOs, will not provide enough high-paying, high-value jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Finance, insurance, and real estate (excluding construction) provide less than 10% of the city's jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Nearly 85% of Hong Kong's adult population (over 3.1 million people) work for large service-oriented companies like supermarkets, utilities, and business services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This domestic landscape is stagnant, dominated by land developer conglomerates, with anti-competitive markets making it difficult for new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This contributes to massive and growing wage inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, with many service workers being over-educated for their jobs and having few career upgrading prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
2.  **Investment Assets**: While policies encouraging stock ownership have increased participation in the Hong Kong stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, primarily as a market for Chinese companies fleeing US markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, this does not help the lower classes achieve wealth or financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. The average Hong Kong retail stock investor in 2015 was 47 years old and already had a substantially higher income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Stocks are seen as a way to stay rich, not get rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Furthermore, Hong Kong stocks have not grown fast enough to help average salary earners catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, with the Hong Kong 2550 index fund returning 8.2% annually over 10 years and the Hang Seng Index fund only 3.56% over 5 years, compared to the S&P 500's 16.6% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Many of Hong Kong's listed companies operate within the city, meaning their efforts to become shareholder-friendly (e.g., layoffs, non-standard employment) shift economic burdens onto residents, increasing income insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

Since real estate is too expensive for the average Hong Konger, the government and financial sector have sought new assets to package for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. These actions have benefited some, but at the long-term detriment of others:
*   **MTR Privatization**: In 2000, the Hong Kong government partially privatized the MTR, the railway company also known for land development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. After privatization, the MTR stopped receiving free land grants and instead focused on land management, expanding landlord services to include advertising and telecom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. While financially independent, an MTR focused on monetizing existing networks rather than extending them is a long-term failure for public transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Link REIT IPO**: The government sold car parking and retail facilities of public housing complexes to a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) called The Link, ostensibly to raise funds for the housing authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. The Link was IPO'd, with retail investors subscribing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. The IPO valued The Link at up to five times its IPO price, and subsequently, The Link raised rents, driving many shop owners into economic hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## Missed Opportunity

While Hong Kong's shift to services and finance has generated significant wealth for many and its GDP has never been higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, it has come at a cost. The city could have had its prosperous service sector *in addition* to a sophisticated manufacturing sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. The electronics industry could have ascended the technology ladder, building and exporting sophisticated products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. A "Hong Kong TSMC" (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) was not out of the question, given close ties with the West at the time and the opportunity for technology transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

Instead, Hong Kong let this opportunity go, and now it does not produce things that other people want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. As a result, it has converted its public goods and even its people into investable assets or cash flow streams, at considerable cost to its majority poor population, who now see no way out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This serves as a lesson in economic diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

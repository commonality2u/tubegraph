The zipper, also known as a slide fastener, is a device designed to join and bind the edges of two fabrics together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. While seemingly simple, its invention and subsequent evolution involved significant engineering and manufacturing advancements.

## Early Innovations and Naming

The modern slide fastener was invented by Whitcomb Judson in 1891 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. His primary motivation was to alleviate the tedious task of buttoning and unbuttoning high-button boots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Judson, an engineer, primarily focused on pneumatic systems for public transit, with the zipper being a side project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Judson's business partners quickly recognized the product's potential, establishing a company to sell it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This company underwent several ownership changes and transformations, eventually becoming Talon Inc., the original zipper company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Twenty years later, Talon hired Gideon Sundback, a Swedish-American electrical engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Sundback became their head engineer and dedicated years to refining the fastener's design, aiming to improve its reliability and manufacturability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. In 1917, he patented the "hookless number two," a device featuring the interlocking teeth structure characteristic of modern zippers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Crucially, Sundback also invented a machine capable of efficiently producing this new fastener design at scale, which was vital for its widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Initially, Talon faced challenges in convincing textile companies to use their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. During World War One, zippers found use in soldiers' belts, life vests, and sleeping bags, and also had a niche in tobacco bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The term "zipper" didn't come into common use until 1923, when B.F. Goodrich used it for a rubber boot product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This boot significantly boosted demand, leading Talon to halt other productions and concentrate solely on zippers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Although Goodrich intended the term to refer to the boot as a whole, people quickly associated it with Talon Inc.'s hookless fastener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Talon was displeased with "zipper" becoming a generic trademark they couldn't control, even running ads in the 1930s urging people to "Call this slide fastener Talon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Market Adoption Challenges
The rise of the zipper was gradual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Despite the success of the zipper boot, Talon struggled to convince garment manufacturers to integrate zippers into clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Zippers were more expensive than buttons, offered fewer color options, and manufacturers worried about their weight and difficulty of integration into existing workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Talon's strategy included:
*   Starting with girdles for women and work clothing for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   Including zippers in home sewing kits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   Hiring a sales force to target trouser makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   Holding zipper-themed fashion shows for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

These efforts eventually paid off, and Talon grew steadily through the Great Depression, producing over 200 million zippers by 1939, up from 80 million just three years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Zipper Manufacturing Process and Components
Zippers consist of three main components: the tape, the teeth (or elements), and the slider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Teeth (Elements):** These are the parts that mesh together to open and close the zipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. When meshed, they form a chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Slider:** This part moves up and down, engaging with the elements to lock or unlock them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Stops at the ends prevent the slider from coming off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Tape:** This is the fabric portion of the zipper to which the teeth are attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

For a few cents, a zipper's cost is largely driven by its main materials and labor (88%), which is unusual for a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Linings, fastenings, and other accessories account for the remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

[[zipper_manufacturing_process_and_components | Creating a metal zipper]] involves several steps:
1.  **Wire:** It begins with pre-made metal wire in a Y-shape, often an alloy of copper and zinc for rust resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
2.  **Shearing:** A tiny chip is sheared off the wire's end, forming the element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
3.  **Forging:** A small hook-like protrusion (sometimes called a "scoop") is made into the element, which catches the teeth and helps keep them together when zipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
4.  **Attaching/Bending:** The tooth is attached to the tape by bending the element's two legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

Economic and effective production requires mechanical automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Chain machines automatically and accurately attach the teeth to the tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## YKK's Impact on Zipper Evolution
The story of [[history_of_ykk_and_its_founder_tadao_yoshida | Tadao Yoshida]] and YKK began in Japan, where Yoshida started San S Shokai in 1934 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Faced with poor quality zippers (over half were defective), Yoshida prioritized quality control, even physically testing zippers with a hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. His shop began producing its own zippers, establishing a metal factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

A turning point for YKK was Yoshida's acquisition of American-made chain machines in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. These machines, arriving in 1950, provided YKK with a significant [[competition_and_innovation_in_the_zipper_industry | competitive advantage]], allowing six workers to do the work of 160 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. YKK quickly commissioned 100 replicas from a Japanese company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

YKK continually improved these machines:
*   In 1953, they modified the machines to attach teeth at regular time intervals, eliminating the need for spacers and significantly speeding up the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   Further improvements were made to enable single-person operation and increase production volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

YKK's strong belief in vertical integration was another key evolutionary factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. From 1954, Yoshida began work on the Kurobe Factory, an integrated campus capable of producing everything from the metal for wires to the textiles for tapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This philosophy was extended overseas, with YKK USA factories melting their own brass, creating polyester, and weaving their own zipper tapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This control over raw material production gave YKK advantages in developing new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

[[global_zipper_market_and_ykks_dominance | YKK's dominance]] by 1958 was a result of its automation prowess, ability to produce its own machines, and control over the entire supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Talon's Decline and Modern Zipper Trends
Talon's decline and YKK's rise accelerated in 1975, when Talon and its trade association failed to persuade the American government to restrict foreign zipper imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Talon's market share plummeted from 70% in 1971 to just 35% by 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. However, this decline wasn't solely due to imports, as YKK was already producing zippers in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. YKK began importing zipper parts for assembly in the U.S. in 1960 and opened a vertically integrated factory in Macon, Georgia, in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. YKK has since followed textile manufacturers globally, establishing factories in 71 countries to overcome tariff barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

Talon's acquisition by the industrial conglomerate Textron in 1968 also contributed to its downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Textron, as brand managers, lacked the textile expertise needed to compete effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Talon lost market share in industrial garments and failed to adapt to new fashion trends emphasizing freer, more colorful clothes made from stretchier synthetic fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

In contrast, YKK offered new zippers that aligned with these trends:
*   **Concealed Zipper:** This design hides the teeth, blending into the garment and offering an "invisibility" feature long desired by manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Plastic Injection Mold Zippers:** These could be dyed into vibrant colors, appealing to the flashy fashions of the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

Today, the zipper market is segmented:
*   **Ultra-high luxury:** Dominated by European brands like Switzerland's Riri and Italy's Lamppo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **Low end:** Controlled by manufacturers in China or India who compete solely on price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Middle to high-end:** Where YKK makes approximately 80% of its $6 billion annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

A significant competitor in the middle to high-end market is Fujian SBS Zipper, founded in China in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. SBS aggressively sells cheap but high-quality zippers to mid-fashion garment manufacturers like Zara, Target, and Michael Kors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. In response, YKK has focused on producing higher-quality luxury zippers while also expanding aggressively in China to counter SBS on their home turf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

The evolution of the humble zipper over more than a century demonstrates that manufacturing can be as technologically sophisticated as any modern software, requiring immense research and development for advancements that are often taken for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

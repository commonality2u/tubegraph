In late August 2023, Huawei quietly reintroduced its own phone chips to the market with the release of the Huawei Mate 60 Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Central to this launch was the phone's system-on-a-chip (SOC), the Kirin 9000s (麒麟9000s), identified as a [[smics_7nm_chip_production | 7-nanometer class chip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Although Huawei did not officially disclose the manufacturer, it is widely believed to be [[comparison_with_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | SMIC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This development has sparked significant discussion within the semiconductor industry and geopolitical circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Mate 60 Pro and its Kirin 9000s Chip

The Mate 60 Pro is described as a high-quality phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. TechInsights analysis indicates the Kirin 9000s is a 107 square millimeter die, roughly 2% larger than Huawei's previous leading-edge chips, the Kirin 9000 and 9000E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The Kirin 9000 was briefly produced using [[comparison_with_tsmcs_n7_process | TSMC's 5 nanometer process]] until American sanctions halted the collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

The new [[smics_7nm_chip_production | 7-nanometer class chip]] is approximately 5-6 years behind the current leading edge, as [[comparison_with_tsmcs_n7_process | TSMC]] has been shipping 3-nanometer class chips in 2023 for products like the iPhone 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Teardowns and speed tests suggest the Kirin 9000s supports 5G connectivity, though Huawei appears to be discreet about this functionality in its press releases and operating system interface, which reports 4G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The chip's CPU core uses a customized Arm intellectual property, and its GPU seems to be a new custom design by Huawei or HiSilicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Early reports noted texture errors in some games, which are expected to be resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Yields and Production Scale

A critical aspect of the [[smics_7nm_chip_production | Kirin 9000s]] production is its [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | yields]]. Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis suggested that [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | SMIC's]] early [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | yields]] for this node are likely better than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Historically, [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | yields]] start low but improve as the fabrication process matures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. [[comparison_with_tsmcs_n7_process | TSMC]] successfully scaled its [[comparison_with_tsmcs_n7_process | N7's yields]] to support iPhone launches, and a similar trajectory is expected for [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | SMIC]]; increased sales of Huawei phones will accelerate this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The [[smics_7nm_chip_production | 7nm chip]] and the manufacturing node that produced it are considered "really, really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## The Evolution of [[smics_7nm_chip_production | SMIC's 7nm Process]]

The emergence of the [[smics_7nm_chip_production | Kirin 9000s]] was not entirely unforeseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Previous predictions indicated the likelihood of a HiSilicon (Huawei's chip design arm) chip utilizing [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | SMIC's]] [[smics_7nm_chip_production | N+2 process node]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. In early August 2023, Nikkei Asia also reported that [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | SMIC]] was collaborating with Huawei on a new 5G chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

News of the [[smics_7nm_chip_production | SMIC N+2 process]] first surfaced in July 2022, when it was being used for Bitcoin miners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Bitcoin miners, with their repetitive structures, serve as effective tools for improving and refining a process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Producing a complex phone SOC like the Kirin 9000s demonstrates significant progress by [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | SMIC]] and Co-CEO Liang Mong-song within approximately one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## [[future_prospects_for_chinese_semiconductor_manufacturing | Future Prospects for Chinese Semiconductor Manufacturing]]

Experts anticipate the development of even more advanced chips from [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | SMIC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Dr. Burn Lin, a former [[comparison_with_tsmcs_n7_process | TSMC]] R&D director and colleague of Liang Mong-song, stated in January 2022 that [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | SMIC]] could fabricate [[future_prospects_for_chinese_semiconductor_manufacturing | 5-nanometer class chips]] using only [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | multi-patterning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### The Role of Immersion Lithography

[[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Immersion lithography]], specifically 193-nanometer immersion machines like [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML's Twinscan NXT 2000i]], remains crucial for advanced semiconductor manufacturing, performing 70-80% of the lithography work for major foundries like Intel, [[comparison_with_tsmcs_n7_process | TSMC]], and Samsung even in their latest nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. While the United States banned Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography exports to China, this may have been a "red herring" as [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV lithography]] might still lack competitive throughput, power, and cost for full utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

The US administration initially hesitated to ban 193i machines due to concerns about cooperation from Japan and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It wasn't until June 30, 2023, that these countries joined the US in imposing export restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] expressed dissatisfaction, attempting to sell as many Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) immersion machines as possible before year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This means [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | SMIC]] likely possesses enough of these machines to expand [[smics_7nm_chip_production | 7-nanometer production]] and potentially transition to 5-nanometer production, despite ongoing [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | challenges]] related to maintenance and spare parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. A [[future_prospects_for_chinese_semiconductor_manufacturing | 5-nanometer class Huawei chip]] is anticipated within 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## The Emergence of a [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China-Only Supply Line]]

The Mate 60 Pro signifies more than just an advanced chip; it represents the convergence of [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | domestic Chinese suppliers]] to create a phone with feature-parity to global market offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Bloomberg identified numerous domestic suppliers, including for the radio frequency front-end module and the satellite communications modem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. With the exception of memory components (reportedly from SK Hynix), the entire phone essentially constitutes a [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China-only ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

This indicates the groundwork is laid for a self-contained ecosystem within the People's Republic of China capable of producing a wide array of [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | domestic electronics]], including smartphone SOCs, CPUs, edge AI NPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Impact on the Industry and Future Moves

While a phone chip comparable to five-year-old technology might not seem groundbreaking, it poses a significant threat to companies like Qualcomm, Apple, and MediaTek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Ming-chi Kuo suggests that Qualcomm's sales of tens of millions of chips for Huawei phones are likely to be supplanted by the [[smics_7nm_chip_production | Kirin 9000s]] and similar domestic chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Dylan Patel also notes that non-Chinese semiconductor makers and Apple stand to lose business to this new domestic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

After fulfilling Huawei orders, [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | SMIC]] is expected to seek new [[smics_7nm_chip_production | N+2 node customers]] in high-powered computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. A key objective would be to partner in creating a [[future_prospects_for_chinese_semiconductor_manufacturing | domestic AI accelerator]], akin to an Nvidia A100 or TPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. A [[future_prospects_for_chinese_semiconductor_manufacturing | Chinese 7-nanometer AI accelerator]], potentially designed by Biren, Baidu, Alibaba Cloud, or Tencent, is anticipated within 1-2 years, unless sanctions intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### What [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China]] Does Next

[[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's semiconductor manufacturing efforts]] are a testament to their resilience in the face of sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The immediate goal, from a manufacturing perspective, should be to widely distribute the Mate 60 Pro to maximize scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Scaling production by selling millions of units, not just domestically but also to Europe, Australia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Huawei is actively marketing to help users install Google products on their phones to overcome market challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Every export sale not only reduces business for Western phone makers but also strengthens [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | SMIC]], enabling faster yield increases, profitability, and funding for a move to 5 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

[[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | SMIC]] should also focus on replicating and advancing packaging technologies. While phone chips prioritize thinness and heat management (using Chip Scale Packaging), advanced AI applications require new architectures like [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | chiplets]] and [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | 2.5D die-stacking]] to manage data bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

Furthermore, the [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | Chinese Government]] will need to bolster its domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment ecosystem, aiming to replace foreign suppliers like [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]], Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, Lam Research, and metrology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Concerns exist that foreign equipment may contain "kill switches," making self-sufficiency imperative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## United States Response

The US Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security justified cutting off foreign support for advanced semiconductors (logic ICs at 16/14nm or below, or non-planar architectures) citing concerns about military modernization, weapons of mass destruction, and human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

> "The restrictions implemented in this rule follow extensive United States government consideration of the impact of advanced computing ICs, “supercomputers,” and semiconductor manufacturing equipment on enabling military modernization, including the development of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and human rights abuses." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>

This implies that the US government possesses intelligence indicating that [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's]] ability to manufacture advanced logic chips has significant implications for regional military balance of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Given the progress by [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | SMIC]] and Huawei, if the US government perceives [[smics_7nm_chip_production | a Chinese 7 nanometer node]] as a national security threat, further efforts to halt its development may be undertaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

To achieve this, a better understanding of remaining semiconductor manufacturing equipment flows is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | SMIC]] still relies on foreign equipment for this node, as domestic suppliers are years behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Currently, equipment companies like Applied, Lam Research, Tokyo Electron, and KLA can sell most of their tools (for deposition, etch, metrology, epitaxy, etc.) that are used for 7nm and 5nm processes, ostensibly for lagging-edge 28nm nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. These tools are likely being repurposed for manufacturing chips like the [[smics_7nm_chip_production | Kirin 9000s]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

To prevent [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China]] from developing leading-edge capacity at scale, the US government, in collaboration with allies like Japan, the Netherlands, and Germany, should consider tighter export controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. These controls could target currently repurposed tools such as Argon Fluoride Immersion lithography, mask, and CMP equipment, and implement far less liberal use of licenses for firms like [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | SMIC]] on the entity list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[smics_7nm_chip_production | Kirin 9000s]] represents a significant milestone in technology history, analogous to Samsung's 1986 achievement of the 1-megabit DRAM chip, which rapidly closed the semiconductor gap with Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Two years later, Samsung reached parity with Japan with its 4-megabit chip, contributing to Japan's subsequent decline in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

The People's Republic of China appears to be adopting a similar strategy in [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | semiconductor manufacturing]], mirroring South Korea's successful approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The impact of this development is expected to ripple far beyond the immediate semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

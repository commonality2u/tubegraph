In its early years, the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union]] attempted to establish a moneyless society, a policy which ultimately proved disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Despite the country being severely affected by years of [[economic_impact_of_war_and_revolution_on_the_soviet_union | war and revolution]], the Bolsheviks aimed to immediately create their ideal socialist Utopia, paradoxically involving the printing of hundreds of billions of rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This period, characterized by the [[economic_impact_of_war_and_revolution_on_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union's]] "first flirtation with Communism," was devastating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Marxist Economic Theory and the Goal of a Moneyless Society

Classical economists viewed money as a neutral facilitator of trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Karl Marx acknowledged this but emphasized money's problematic role in capitalist society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Marx's criticisms of money included:
*   **Cyclical Booms and Crises**: Money contributed to cycles of overproduction and underproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Capitalists only engage in transactions (M-C-M') if they expect a profit (M' > M), leading to hoarding and subsequent overproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Exploitation of the Working Class**: Money was seen as the mechanism through which the bourgeoisie extracted wealth from the working class, leading to workers' alienation from their labor's valuable output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

According to Marxist thought, a socialist, centrally planned society would not require money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The notion of eliminating money was widespread among the Bolsheviks, who considered it a major facet of the new economy for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Economic Devastation Leading up to War Communism

Russia's economy was in a dire state even before the Bolshevik takeover due to the [[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_soviet_economy | impacts of World War I and the Russian Civil War]].

### Impact of World War I
World War I prompted European governments, including Imperial Russia, to abandon the gold standard and print money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Financial Collapse**: Russia left the gold standard in June 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The government ran massive deficits: 39% in the first year and 75% in the two subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Economic Decline**: The war led to budget overruns, foreign borrowing, physical destruction, and a collapse in economic output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   Between 1913 and 1917, industrial workers declined by 16.4% and total industrial output fell by 22.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Inflation**: By early 1917, paper rubles in circulation increased from 1.6 billion in July 1914 to 9 billion, a 5.5-fold increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The government's 1917 deficit was 82% of its budget, with 73% funded by the printing press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Consequences of Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and Civil War
The new revolutionary government faced severe territorial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Territorial Losses**: The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 1918) caused Russia to lose a third of its population, nearly a third of its agricultural land, and over half of its industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   The oil wells of Baku and the Caucasus (97% of Russia's total oil output) were inaccessible until late 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
    *   Ukraine, a vital region, had provided 78% of Russia's coal, 74% of its iron ore, and 80% of its grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The Bolsheviks only reliably regained control of Ukraine by 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Russian Civil War**: Many territories remained occupied by anti-Bolshevik forces as the country plunged into the [[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_soviet_economy | Russian Civil War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

At the time of the Bolshevik takeover, the Russian economy was in a "sorry state," largely semi-industrialized and agricultural, which was not ideal for transitioning to socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## War Communism: Bolshevik Economic Policies

Despite the dire economic situation, the Bolsheviks pressed forward with their plans, laid out by Lenin in "The Immediate Tasks of Soviet Rule," aiming for a dictatorship of the proletariat and centralized economic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Nationalization of Banks
Marx believed banking was central to capitalism, and the Communist Manifesto advocated for a single central bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Russia's financial system was already highly centralized, with 12 banks holding 80% of the country's capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Process**: The Bolsheviks declared a state monopoly on banking on November 20, 1917, seizing the Russian State Bank (Gosbank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Private banks were ordered to fund worker-controlled factories, and upon their refusal, troops occupied the largest banks in December 1917, transferring their capital to Gosbank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Consequences**: By the end of 1918, all banks were liquidated and merged into Gosbank, which ceased lending and became an accounting unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This cut off credit, leading to 405 enterprises and 205,000 workers being shut down in the first quarter of 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Nationalization of Industry
In June 1918, the Council of People's Commissars announced the nationalization of industry, seen as "pulling out and cutting the wires through which the capitalists controlled the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Process**: Throughout late 1918 and early 1919, key sectors like railways, shipping, and mining were nationalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This process was chaotic; less than 14% of nationalizations were managed by the central government, with the majority handled by local organizations and trade unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Consequences**: Many skilled workers and business owners were ejected, and new owners often lacked the expertise to run the industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Funding the War and Government
The Bolsheviks faced the challenge of funding the [[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_soviet_economy | Russian Civil War]] and government operations without traditional capitalist finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Lack of Funds**: No one would lend money to the Bolshevik government after it repudiated foreign debts and nationalized assets in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Income taxes provided only 7.3% of spending in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, forcing the government to raise indirect taxes and implement extraordinary income taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Printing Press**: The only way to fill budget gaps was to print more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. By the end of 1918, inflation hit 598%, with over 60 billion rubles in circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The value of rubles measured in 1913 terms fell from 2.4 billion in 1917 to 222 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Food Requisitioning
Food supply was a major concern early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Grain Monopoly**: The Tsarist government had introduced a grain monopoly during World War I, prohibiting private trading and forcing farmers to sell surpluses to the state at fixed prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. This was continued by the provisional government and reaffirmed by the Bolsheviks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Peasant Resistance**: The crashing ruble made wages irrelevant to peasants, who refused to sell their goods at official state prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **"Food Dictatorship"**: The government viewed the problem as one of distribution rather than production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. In May 1918, they announced a "food dictatorship," reaffirming the grain monopoly and permitting armed force to seize food from peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This further disincentivized peasants from producing surpluses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

### Hyperinflation and Attempted Demonetization
High inflation rapidly spiraled into hyperinflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Uncontrolled Printing**: In May 1919, the People's Bank began printing as much money as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Inflation soared from 598% to 1,376% in 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. The ruble's value crashed so fast that budgets were published retroactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Bolshevik Justification**: Amazingly, the Bolsheviks argued that hyperinflation signified their socialist transformation was working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. They believed devaluing money to nothing would annihilate the power of the wealthy, transition to state distribution, and create a moneyless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. "The ABC of Communism" stated that the extensive issue of paper money would promote the gradual disappearance of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **Intensified Demonetization**: After the Red Army's Civil War victory around April 1920, the Bolsheviks intensified policies to demonetize the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
    *   Legislation made public services like transportation, telegraph, medicines, food, consumer goods, fuel, and postage free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
    *   Private trade was to be abolished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
    *   Taxes and wages were paid "in kind" (physical goods) rather than cash; by 1921, 93% of all wages were paid this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
    *   Attempts were made to replace money with new accounting units, such as "tread" (a day of simple labor), but these only confused people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Unprecedented Issuance**: In 1921, the government issued 16.3 trillion new rubles, yet still ran a deficit of 21.9 trillion rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. In 1922, this swelled to 1.97 quadrillion new rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

## Consequences and Reversal

By 1921, the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet government]] recognized that War Communism had gone "too far" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Economic Collapse
*   **Production Halt**: Production of items like steel, sugar, and bricks virtually ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Overall industrial production fell to a third of pre-war 1913 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
*   **Lack of Incentive**: Without money, there was no incentive for people to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Work desertion rates on railways hit 40%, and in 1920, a worker produced only 45% of their pre-war output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   **Illegal Markets**: The state's inability to centralize control over every item led to flourishing illegal markets that supplied most people's food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

### Social Impact
*   **Caloric Intake**: Daily caloric intake in 1919 fell by 30% from the 1910s average (3,820 to 2,680 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.
*   **Famine**: A devastating famine broke out in 1921-1922, resulting in 5 million deaths, largely because food requisitioning left peasants with no reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

### Rebellions and the New Economic Policy (NEP)
Despite the end of the [[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_soviet_economy | Russian Civil War]], unrest continued, with peasant revolts like the Kronstadt rebellion in 1921 shaking Lenin's resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   **NEP Implementation**: Lenin realized market activity had to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. In March 1921, the New Economic Policy (NEP) was implemented to reverse the decline, grow output, and stabilize the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Currency Reform**: By 1923, after issuing 176.5 quintillion new rubles, the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet government]] fully reversed course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. They issued a gold-backed currency, made the Central Bank independent, and rebalanced the budget, leading to calmed rebellions and recovering output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

Lenin reflected on the mistakes, stating, "Life has shown how wrong we were" in believing enthusiasm alone could accomplish economic tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. While he attributed the mistakes to the Civil War's interruptions, the state's initial intention during War Communism was clearly to "tear the country away from capitalism, create a monopoly on trade, and eradicate money itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. These plans, however, led to chaos, violence, and a catastrophic collapse in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

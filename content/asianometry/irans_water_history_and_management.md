Iran faces a long-running water problem, historically prone to aridity and low rainfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Much of its central lands are largely uninhabitable without water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Over the years, the country developed an extensive industrial water system to irrigate dry soil and support a growing population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This article examines Iran's water history and its ongoing water management challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Geographical and Climatic Context

Iran receives limited precipitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. In terms of annual average precipitation, it ranks 158th out of 189 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
Key precipitation characteristics include:
*   75% of precipitation falls on just 25% of the country's area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   50% of rainfall occurs during winter months, with only 4% during summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   Central deserts receive less than 50 millimeters of rainfall annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Iran's geography includes:
*   **Caspian Sea (North)**: The world's largest inland body of water, which is brackish but can be desalinated, and receives most of the country's rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman (South)**: This southern water basin covers a quarter of Iran's land but holds nearly half of its renewable water resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Mountains and Slopes**: Large mountains facing these bodies of water produce snowmelt that feeds several rivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. With the exception of the Karun River, these rivers are seasonal, prone to overflowing in spring but with little to no flow in summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Lakes**: Iran has 10 lakes, most of which are very salty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
Ultimately, less than one percent of Iran's 1.6 million square kilometers is surface water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Historical Water Management

Iran has been an arid region for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The first civilizations, around 1250 BC, settled in the water-rich Southwest and Northwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Settling the arid center required sophisticated water management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### The Qanat System
Around 3,000 years ago, ancient Persians pioneered a sophisticated water supply system called the qanat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: A qanat is a gently downward-sloping underground tunnel that transported snowmelt water from mountains to plains, sometimes extending for tens of kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Advantages**: It relied purely on gravity for automatic operation, and being underground, the water remained cool and did not evaporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Water flow could be dammed and stored for later use when not needed for irrigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Spread and Impact**: Knowledge of building qanats was passed down through generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, contributing to their spread from Luxembourg to Xinjiang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Prudent water management enabled the Achaemenid Empire (550-330 BC) to become the largest known empire of its day, despite lacking a major river like the Yangtze or Euphrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Continued Use**: Qanats were used for many years, and engineering discipline was steadily built upon by Persian scholars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The "Extraction of Hidden Waters" by Muhammad al-Karaji, over a thousand years old, is one of the oldest hydrogeology books, discussing aquifer finding, exploratory wells, and qanat construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Qajar Dynasty and Capital Relocation
In 1786, Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar relocated the capital to Tehran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Tehran had little access to surface water, leading to the construction of 500 qanats over the next 200 years to supply the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. More qanats were built to supply other central plains cities, resulting in over 270,000 kilometers of underground tunnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Modernization and Decline of Qanats (20th Century)

In the 1900s, water needs grew beyond the qanats' capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. During the Qajar Dynasty, 30% of the population was nomadic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. After World War I, Reza Shah Pahlavi's new government settled these nomads into villages, necessitating new consistent water sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Rise of Modern Water Systems
With limited surface water, Iranians turned to hydraulic mega-projects like dams and irrigation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Modern Wells**: Iran's first modern water well was built in 1915 and quickly gained popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Building a qanat was expensive and time-consuming (up to 10 years for new construction, 1-2 years for expansion), requiring significant manual labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Drilling a hole for groundwater with an electric pump, however, was very quick, and Iran had plentiful groundwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Decline of Qanats**: Authorities pushed these new systems over qanats, causing the latter to fall into disrepair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. By 1950, qanats supplied only 50% of the country's water, down from 75% in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### The White Revolution (1963)
Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah, implemented a land reform scheme called the White Revolution in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Demographic Context**: Population growth was accelerating, reaching 25.8 million and expanding at about 3% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Many people moved to cities, driving rapid urbanization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Agricultural Policy**: The government aimed to implement new industrial agriculture to feed the growing population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Land reform intended to transfer 50% of agricultural lands from landlords to peasants, who would be taught new techniques and given tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Impact on Qanats**: This reform had profound effects on qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Previously, landlords paid for qanat maintenance, making them a public good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The land reform removed this responsibility, and no centralized authority competently took over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The Iranian Ministry of Water and Power (established 1964) largely ignored qanats, leading many to fall into disrepair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. By 2000, less than 10% of Iran's water came from qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Dam Building and Irrigation Expansion**: Given Iran's arid climate and limited arable land (10.5%), the government built dams and pumped groundwater to irrigate land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. 19 new dam projects were initiated, 14 completed before 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This industrial water management system expanded irrigated lands from 8,000 square kilometers in 1968 to 22,662 square kilometers in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This policy was borrowed from the American development of the dry Western United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Early Groundwater Issues**: Even in those days, Iranians experienced [[consequences_of_groundwater_overuse | problems of groundwater over-extraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. In 1966, parliament passed laws to ban drilling and over-pumping due to signs of a dropping water table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Social Instability**: The land reform largely failed, with four out of five peasant families receiving no land or failing to keep it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This, and other broken promises, contributed to social instabilities leading to the Islamic Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Post-Islamic Revolution Water Management

The Islamic Revolution brought a new government and strained relations with the West, particularly the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Trade restrictions hindered access to advanced water technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, though Iran's water issues aren't primarily due to technology access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. These restrictions fueled a drive for food self-sufficiency, which gained national security importance during the Iran-Iraq War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Population Growth and Food Demand
The revolution also encouraged rapid population growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   In the past three decades, Iran's population grew by an average of 1 million people each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   By the end of 2022, the World Bank estimated Iran's population at 88.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, over four times its 1960 size and double its size 20 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   While recent birth rates have fallen, the population is still expanding at about 1.2% annually, which the government aims to maintain for demographic aging reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

To support this growth and achieve self-sufficiency, Iran significantly increased food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Crop production grew 175% from 1980 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Cereals like wheat, barley, and rice are Iran's biggest crops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Iran became the 12th largest wheat producer by 2012, aiming for self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Agricultural Water Use and Inefficiency
*   **Dominant Water User**: 93% of all water used in Iran is for farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. The mining industry is a distant second at 1.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Subsidies**: The government heavily subsidized water and fertilizer costs for the agricultural sector and guaranteed food purchase prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Inefficiency**: Nearly free water encouraged inefficient use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Iran's average irrigation efficiency is under 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This is because over 70% of land is surface irrigated, leading to substantial water loss due to evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Economic Impact**: This inefficiency has hurt agricultural productivity, contributing to the sector's decline in the primarily oil-based economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Agriculture contributed just 12.4% of Iran's 2021 GDP, down from 25.9% in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   **Food Imports**: Despite efforts, Iran is still not completely food self-sufficient; for example, it imported 1.8 million tons of wheat from Russia in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Reform Challenges**: Reforms to improve farming efficiency face obstacles because agriculture employs 23% of Iran's population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. The current government is sensitive to rural issues, believing the previous regime's biggest mistake was ignoring villages and agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

## Decentralized Water Management Structure

After the Islamic Revolution, Water Resource Management Affairs decentralized from a single body to several departments and four ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Health and Medical Education**: Responsible for setting drinking water quality standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Energy**: Allocates water for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use, and regulates wastewater and hydropower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Agriculture Jihad**: Formed by a 2001 merger, it allocates water among farmers and collects water fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The former Ministry of Construction Jihad, a group of revolutionaries, built water infrastructure like distribution pipes, roads, bridges, and filtration systems, aiming to combat rural poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Department of Environment**: Controls water pollution, prepares policies, and assesses hydropower and irrigation projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
This divided situation prevents an integrated approach to water supply issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

## Current Water Supply Strategies and Their Impacts

In recent decades, the Iranian government has focused on increasing water supply rather than reducing demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### Dam Building
Iran has continued and even intensified its dam-building efforts, becoming one of the world's biggest dam-building countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. It currently has over 588 large and small dams, with about 100 more under construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Environmental Concerns**: Damming is controversial due to its widespread [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources | environmental effects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. While providing water reservoirs and hydroelectric power, years of water impoundment can uniquely and difficultly damage the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. For instance, the Upper Gotvand Dam, completed in 2012, has accumulated over 66.5 million tons of salt in its reservoir, raising salinity levels in surrounding soils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

### Desalination
To meet rising urban water demand, the government is building high-profile [[water_scarcity_and_desalination_in_the_gulf_region | desalination plants]] on the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. However, transporting this water to the parched central mega-cities is expensive and likely not economically viable for agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

### Impact on Surface Water Bodies
Agricultural demand and increasing development have severely drained surface water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **Lake Urmia**: Once Iran's and the Middle East's largest lake, it has shrunk aggressively due to persistent drought and water mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. A massive bridge project (1970s-early 2000s) also contributed by cutting the lake in half, accelerating its shrinkage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Today, the lake is a tenth of its former size, and its dry bed causes huge salt storms that ruin nearby farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **Hamoun Lake**: Eastern Iran's largest freshwater body, on the border with Afghanistan, has been home to people for 5,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. While seasonal, it vanished entirely during a bad drought in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. The dry lake bed caused large dust storms, a serious health hazard, leading to the evacuation of 124 surrounding villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

## Groundwater Crisis

Iran only recently began extensive tapping of its groundwater resources, a trend accelerated after the White Revolution land reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. Groundwater has rapidly become the country's primary water source, accounting for 55% of total supply in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **Over-extraction**: A 2021 *Nature* study, based on publicly available data from Iranian wells, estimated that over 74 cubic kilometers of water were extracted from 2002 to 2015 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. This volume is equivalent to the 34th largest freshwater lake in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
*   **Unregulated Wells**: While groundwater drilling should be regulated, there is little enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. The number of wells in Iran grew from 47,000 in 1979 to 789,000 in 2013, with almost all being illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   **Consequences of Overuse**:
    *   **Declining Water Table**: As more groundwater is withdrawn, the water table drops, forcing people to drill deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. This is especially true during serious droughts, which will intensify with climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
    *   **Increased Salinity**: The soil and groundwater become saltier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Electrical conductivity measurements, an indicator of salinity, are 85% higher in areas like the Karkheh Basin, a major agricultural region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.
    *   **Land Subsidence**: Declining groundwater levels cause the ground to literally sink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Iran's land is shrinking at an average of about six centimeters per year, with some areas reaching a staggering 19 centimeters annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. Sinking ground damages transmission lines, bridges, and buildings, and undermines structural safety, particularly concerning in an earthquake-prone region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. Furthermore, subsidence permanently damages an aquifer's capacity to hold water, making the loss irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

## Conclusion

While Iran's massive population contributes to less renewable water per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, the core of Iran's water crisis lies in demand and mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. Difficult decisions are needed regarding water usage in homes, industry, and especially agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Implementing these changes will be challenging for a populist government managing one of the world's most heavily subsidized economies amidst turbulent climate change and political situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. However, the long-term costs of this water mismanagement are severe, making long-term reforms necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

At the time of Japan's opening up, nearly all of the world's watches originated from either the United States or Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The Swiss diligently sought to protect their watchmaking secrets from spreading to other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Early 20th Century Dominance

At the turn of the century, the global watch market was shared between the United States and Switzerland, though their success models differed significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While the U.S. had a few large companies producing many simple, cheap pocket watches through screw automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, the Swiss watch industry was the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

The Swiss industry consisted of numerous small companies specializing in a wide array of high-precision timepieces, catering to a "high class" market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. In 1901, Swiss statistics recorded 663 watch industry firms, employing 24,858 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The largest company, Longines, employed only 853 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. In 1905, Longines produced 130,000 pieces, significantly less than Waltham in the U.S. which produced multiples more annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Swiss diversity was a strength, enabling them to produce many products for various needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. All of these products were exported abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Switzerland dominated the pocket watch export market, holding approximately 93% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Japanese Challenge and the "Shablon" Strategy

Japan rapidly adopted Western technologies, including those for railroads, telegraphs, and the military, as part of their overarching goal of modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Initially, watches were luxury goods imported to Japan, primarily seen by the social elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Japan sought to reduce its reliance on clock imports from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. As clocks were technologically simpler than watches, the early Japanese industry focused on replicating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. By the 1930s, [[japanese_market_strategies_in_the_watch_industry | Japan]] became a clock exporting power, capturing 35% of the total market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

Japanese companies, like Hattori (later Seiko), sought to produce pocket watches as they gained popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. However, Japanese watches initially could not compete with Swiss and American companies in terms of thinness, accuracy, or reliability, and were more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

After an unequal treaty with the United States lapsed in 1899, Japan regained sovereignty over its trade relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The Japanese government immediately implemented an import substitution policy, raising tariffs to protect domestic manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Tariffs on silver and nickel watch imports rose from 5% to 25%, and then to 40% in 1906 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Protected from Western imports, Hattori's watchmaking business flourished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Hattori improved manufacturing by automating select Swiss-inspired models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. To gain expertise, Hattori hired engineering labor from Tokyo universities to disassemble and reassemble Swiss watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. More crucially, Hattori sourced raw watch parts from Switzerland, which were not subject to tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. From 1915 to 1935, Switzerland supplied 69% of Japan's watch parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

This practice of importing disassembled watch movement sets and assembling them domestically was called "shablon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. After tariffs on finished watches were introduced in 1900, Japanese imports of movements surged, significantly outpacing finished watch imports by 1905 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

The Swiss watch industry became concerned that "shablon" would lead to their long-term downfall by transferring critical watchmaking expertise to other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. An example is Rudolph Schmidt, a Swiss citizen who settled in Yokohama in 1894 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. After Japan raised tariffs, Schmidt began importing shablon and eventually shifted the entire watchmaking process to Japan by 1910, alarming the Swiss industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:09:02]</a>. His company later became Citizen Watch Company, another major Japanese watchmaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Swiss Response and World War II

The developments in [[history_of_japanese_watchmaking | Japan]] validated the Swiss fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. By 1935, Hattori's watch factory became the single largest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, and both Hattori and Citizen began expanding abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

With watch exports declining in the 1920s, the Swiss reorganized their industry into a cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Part suppliers signed "watchmaking conventions" to only do business with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. A holding company, ASAG, was set up to acquire movement manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. In 1934, the government intervened, eventually controlling all watchmaking activities and monitoring exports of watch parts and machine tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Shablon was made illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. These measures largely achieved their goals, allowing the Swiss watch industry to enjoy high profits and a consistent 50% share of the global watch market for the next few decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

The 1930s also saw a market shift from pocket watches to wristwatches, which gained new features like self-winding movements, calendars, and waterproof cases, becoming smaller and more complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

During World War II, most watch companies, except the Swiss, halted production to contribute metals to the war effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Many were drafted into producing precision tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Switzerland's neutrality gave them an advantage in the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. American watch companies struggled post-war against cheap Swiss imports, leading to a long-term decline and consolidation of the American industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

## The Quartz Revolution and Swiss Stumble

By 1966, Hattori (Seiko) was producing [[comparison_of_mechanical_and_quartz_watches | mechanical watches]] that performed as well as their Swiss counterparts, establishing themselves as world leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. However, at the same time, Seiko sought to develop a new type of watch that would disrupt the mechanical watch world: the [[impact_of_quartz_technology_on_the_watch_industry | quartz watch]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

The technology behind quartz watches, specifically the piezoelectric effect of quartz crystals, had been known since the 1880s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This property could lead to timepieces far more accurate than any mechanical clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. In 1927, an engineer at Bell Labs created a room-sized, high-precision quartz clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

In 1960, Bulova, an American watchmaker, released the Accutron, the first commercial electronic watch, using a 360 Hz tuning fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. While not quartz-powered, it was ten times more accurate than mechanical watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. The technology was developed by Swiss scientist Max Hetzel, who couldn't interest anyone in Switzerland before turning to the American market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Bulova's commitment to tuning fork technology, even as quartz emerged as the future, proved to be a first-mover disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

However, the Accutron spurred technological development in electronic watches across the US, Japan, and Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Seiko formed a team in 1959 to commercialize quartz timekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. With the commercialization of transistors, small circuits could now power a quartz crystal, measure its oscillations, and translate them into second pulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Seiko released the Seiko Astron SQ on Christmas Day 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, marking a revolution in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

By the mid-1970s, LED quartz watches became the market standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Japanese watch exports to the United States, a critical Swiss market, exploded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>, increasing nearly tenfold to $26 million USD by 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

Swiss exports stagnated, and their market share plummeted from 83% at the beginning of the 1970s to just 20% in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. By 1985, Japanese watch exports to the US totaled $373 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Seiko, Citizen, and Casio effectively pushed the Swiss out of their most valuable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

The Swiss watch industry "fumbled the industry shift to quartz" despite being aware of the technology for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. They had even demonstrated their own prototypes in 1967, two years before the Seiko Astron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. However, the Swiss took great pride in their mechanical heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Their sprawling industry structure of many small firms worked against them, as no individual Swiss company had the resources, initiative, or broad expertise to build such a thing on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

While a mechanical watch requires trained artisans and painstaking effort, a digital watch made with modern semiconductor production methods overwhelms human training with "Titanic scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

## Decline and Comeback

Quartz watches ended the Swiss grip on the global watch industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. As late as 1974, they held 40% of the global market, but ten years later, that share shrank to just 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. By 1983, over half of the country's watchmakers had gone bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. Out of necessity, the Swiss also shifted to quartz technologies, and for a brief period, it seemed like mechanical watch production techniques might be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

However, the Swiss mechanical watch industry has since made a comeback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. They recognized that their products had value beyond just accurately keeping time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. By restructuring into the Swatch Group, the Swiss created luxury watch brands and have since thrived in this niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

Recent discussions on Hacker News about semiconductor degree programs in the United States revealed significant negativity regarding career paths in the field, contrasting sharply with the national drive for semiconductor independence and talent acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Perceptions of Semiconductor Manufacturing Careers

Comments on Hacker News described manufacturing (fab) roles as requiring long hours, frequent on-call duties, and responsibility for tools even when not on call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. One comment asserted that the semiconductor industry is a "problematic career with long hours, subpar labor practices and low pay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

> "If you're a fab person, you'll work long hours, be on call often and you'll get woken up often and eventually it will own a tool that you'll be responsible for even when not on call. Lots of abusive and pathological behavior as well." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
> "A PhD is mandatory, post-doctorate experience is also mandatory, and you also have to put 10 plus years in an R&D sweatshop." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

This perception makes the industry "sound like it's a prison camp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The overall sentiment discourages individuals from joining the semiconductor manufacturing field, despite national efforts to build new fabs and secure talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This contributes to the [[challenges_and_perceptions_in_semiconductor_manufacturing_careers | challenges and perceptions in semiconductor manufacturing careers]].

## Distinguishing Semiconductor Roles

The semiconductor industry broadly consists of manufacturing and design jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. [[differences_between_manufacturing_and_nonmanufacturing_semiconductor_jobs | Design jobs]] create chip designs, while manufacturing jobs involve operating fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

*   **Non-Manufacturing Roles**: Companies like TSMC hire IC design engineers to work with customers on chip fabrication preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. They also employ software developers, including AI engineers to develop algorithms that improve machine performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. These non-manufacturing positions are often compared to software engineering, involving comfortable office work or remote work with high salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Roles**: These roles are characterized by the need for "military-style execution" to deliver complex products at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   **Line Technicians and Operators**: Led by a foreman, their duties include debugging manufacturing issues, operating lines, and inspecting products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. In Taiwan, they work 12-hour shifts (7 AM to 7 PM and vice versa) with a "two days on, two days off" schedule, which is legal in Taiwan and the U.S. (though overtime pay may apply) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. A high school or vocational degree is typically sufficient for these roles, but career progression is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. While pay is better than retail, the high pressure of a manufacturing line is noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
    *   **Engineers**: Work with technicians to guide manufacturing and fix problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Categories include:
        *   **Process Engineers**: Inspect and analyze manufacturing processes, optimizing variables and testing for yield rate improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
        *   **Equipment Engineers**: Monitor and inspect equipment, responsible when it breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. A technical degree is required, not necessarily electrical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
        *   **R&D Engineers**: Work on new product development, facing high pressure and often requiring PhDs, working 10+ hours daily on experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Success in these roles brings significant impact and recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
        *   **Production Management Engineers**: Handle forecasting and logistics, ensuring smooth production and customer awareness of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Good English skills are necessary due to interaction with Western customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
        *   **Smart Manufacturing and AI Engineers**: Utilize big data and AI to enhance production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## The Allure of Software Development

Semiconductor foundries struggle to fill roles like smart manufacturing and AI engineers, particularly in the U.S., due to the significant appeal of the [[impact_of_software_development_industry_attraction_on_semiconductor_field | software development industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Software development is described as "the single best job category in the world" due to its ease of entry, abundance of companies, legendary perks, and "obscenely ridiculously high" salaries, especially with stock compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This appeal is evident in statistics: 9 out of 10 Berkeley EECS majors graduating in 2018 pursued software engineering careers, often with companies like Google or Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Those who remain in semiconductors often opt for [[emerging_trends_and_challenges_in_chip_design | chip design]], which shares similarities with software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The preference is to work remotely from bedrooms writing code rather than in a factory clean suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

This trend is not limited to the U.S.; China faces similar struggles to retain line technicians, with young workers preferring software development for tech giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Even in Taiwan, despite societal pressure towards electrical engineering and TSMC as a premier employer, the company experiences substantial turnover in technician and engineer ranks due to a demanding work culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. The growing presence of chip design companies in Taiwan, like MediaTek, Delta Electronics, and Google's hardware R&D hub, provides attractive alternatives with comparable salaries, leading to talent migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Complexity and Accessibility: A Driving Factor

A significant reason for the preference for software over hardware stems from the accessibility and complexity of modern technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>:
*   **Easy Software Access**: Young Americans can easily access software, for instance, by downloading open-source software like Rails to set up a website, which can spark interest leading to a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Hardware Complexity**: Modern hardware, like cell phones, is too complex for the average person to tinker with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. In contrast, in the 1960s, an average person could understand and fix a transistor radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, and personal computers, though more complex, allowed direct interaction with hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Today, most users only interact with GUI software and user experience, not the underlying hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This lack of direct interaction means young people grow up without thinking about or tinkering with chips, leading them to pursue other careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Addressing the Talent Gap

The specialized skills required in semiconductor manufacturing can lead to workers feeling "trapped" in the field and potentially underpaid or poorly treated due to the limited number of companies doing advanced manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Software engineers and IC chip designers, conversely, have a much larger pool of employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

Companies and governments are trying to address this:
*   **Wage Increases**: TSMC announced an unusually high 20% employee wage raise in 2020, taking effect in 2022, and is working to make it easier for employees to purchase company stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Pipeline Development**: Intel has partnered with Arizona community colleges to establish two-year technical education programs for prospective technicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. In Malaysia, Intel offered research grants and contributed senior engineers' time to train students in semiconductor engineering, particularly in packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Immigration**: The CHIPS Act is projected to create 27,000 new jobs from eight new fabs, with at least 3,500 requiring highly skilled foreign workers with prior experience from firms like TSMC or Samsung to bring tacit engineering knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. However, the political feasibility of a special immigration program for semiconductor engineers and technicians is uncertain, especially given the history of programs like the H-1A visa for nursing shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Immigration alone doesn't solve the fundamental issue of Americans preferring software careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

The [[history_and_decline_of_national_steel_corporation_in_the_philippines | National Steel Corporation (NSC)]] was once considered the "pride of Philippine industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> and a rare example of a well-run government-owned company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, a series of privatizations and subsequent mismanagement ultimately led to its decline and failure by 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

## Early Attempts at Steel Industry Development

After World War II, the Philippine economy was primarily agricultural and semi-colonial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Despite lacking petroleum reserves, the country possessed abundant metallic minerals like iron, copper, gold, and nickel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. President Carlos Garcia initiated an industrialization push, viewing these minerals as crucial building blocks for an industrialized future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. The lack of suitable steel facilities meant raw iron ore was exported to Japan, only for finished steel to be reimported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. This highlighted the need for an integrated steel mill to enable domestic construction of ships, roads, and power infrastructure, and to open doors to specialty alloys and industrial chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

### National Shipyard and Steel Corporation (NASCO)

In 1950, the Philippine government established the National Shipyard and Steel Corporation (NASCO) in Iligan City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. NASCO's steel mill initially processed scrap metal into ingots, bars, shapes, and rods, mainly for shipbuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. The strategic rationale was to build ships domestically for an island nation and gain export experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. By 1955, NASCO received 50 million pesos to set up pig iron plants, which would make it an integrated steel mill, Asia's second such facility after Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

### The First Privatization: Iligan Integrated Steel Mills (ISMI)

A currency crisis affected NASCO's plans, requiring foreign loans to purchase steel-making equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. In 1958, President Garcia requested a loan from the United States Export-Import (Exim) Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. The Exim Bank offered a $62.4 million loan with two conditions: the money had to be spent only on American steel-making equipment, and NASCO had to be privatized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Although the government could retain a 51% share, 49% had to be sold to a private investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. This condition was reportedly due to prior bureaucratic inefficiencies in government initiatives or insistence from American steel companies to protect themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

The joint venture, Iligan Integrated Steel Mills (ISMI), was set up with Jacinto Steel winning the bid as the private investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. By 1962, the Jacintos bought the entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. The privatization process faced delays, and the initial loan proved insufficient for a full integrated steel mill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. The government guaranteed the Exim Bank loan, and the Bank of the Philippines lent ISMI another 30 million pesos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

ISMI struggled to turn a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. One view suggests the Jacintos treated ISMI as an "ATM," cross-subsidizing other family ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Another view attributes the struggles to the government's failure to sufficiently protect the company from domestic competition and provide the same support that steel companies received in other Asian nations, such as Japan's subsidies, import bans, and tax incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

The cold and hot rolling mill was completed between 1967 and 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. ISMI sought another $70 million loan to finish the blast furnace by 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. However, the 1970s brought global oil price shocks and economic turmoil. The peso devalued significantly in 1970, increasing the cost of imported goods and making it difficult for industrialists to service foreign-denominated debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. President Ferdinand Marcos, who did not favor the Jacinto family, allowed the Development Bank of the Philippines to foreclose on ISMI's loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. After martial law was declared in 1972, the military seized ISMI's assets and transferred them to NSC, a Development Bank subsidiary, a process completed in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

## National Steel Corporation (NSC): A Period of Success

NSC was created to stabilize the industry, retain jobs, and save creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. It merged with several bankrupt local steel factories, expanding its capacity from 141,000 tons in 1974 to 452,000 tons by 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. By then, NSC was the country's 11th largest corporation and a leading producer of billets, tin plates, and flat-rolled steel, holding a monopoly over the domestic steel industry for the next two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

NSC's flat steel products were exported to China, Indonesia, and the United States, preferred over domestic competitors despite shipping costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. The company was a major economic driver for Iligan City, providing up to 75% of the city's total revenues in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. It offered generous health care, housing, high salaries, annual increases, bonuses, and sick leave monetization benefits to its 4,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. Employee turnover was below one percent, reflecting the pride in being an NSC worker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

Despite trade reforms in the 1980s that reduced steel tariffs and led to cheap imports from Taiwan and South Korea, NSC remained profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. In 1983, the company invested 27 billion pesos in computerization and other upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. However, the market for flat steel products began to decline into the 1990s due to cheaper imports, necessitating further upgrades, particularly into coils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. NSC still made profits in 1991, but they were trending downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>. Management recognized the need for more investment to stay competitive, especially as NSC still lacked true vertical integration with its own iron and steel making capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.

## The Second Privatization and Decline (Wintek & Hautic)

With the government unable to provide the necessary capital due to overexposure to state-owned corporations, President Fidel Ramos decided to privatize NSC again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. In 1993, a majority share in NSC was auctioned, with the condition that the winner would continue business plans and maintain global competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

### Wintek Holdings

The winner was Wintek Holdings, a Malaysian company, whose transaction was finalized in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. This year is marked by many NSC employees as the "end of life as they knew it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. The key issue was that Wintek Holdings were foreign steel traders, not steel makers, and their top management had no idea how to run a steel manufacturing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. The CEO commuted from Kuala Lumpur, planning and update meetings ceased, eroding employee trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. They switched suppliers to their own trading corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>.

In late 1995, the new management ordered a massive quantity of raw steel goods at peak prices, incurring significant costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. Critically, they clamped down on financial disclosures to banks, creating opportunities for fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>. Losses skyrocketed, and in 1995, NSC laid off employees for the first time since 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. Despite 1996 being one of the best economic years for the Philippines, NSC recorded an unprecedented loss of 2 billion pesos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.

### Hautic Investment Limited

In early 1997, Wintek sold NSC to another Malaysian trading firm, Hautic Investment Limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>. Hautic was highly leveraged, having borrowed $800 million USD for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. The [[asian_financial_crisis_of_1997 | Asian Financial Crisis of 1997]] was therefore "quite inconvenient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>. Hautic also brought in a top management team with no experience in steel making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>. Planned upgrades never happened, and previous upgrades suffered from a lack of maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. Cheap imported products continued to flood the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.

The crisis led to another massive devaluation of the peso, making NSC's US dollar-denominated loans and raw materials extremely expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. Creditors and suppliers ended relationships, and employees took early retirement buyouts, further straining finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>. An intervention by the city failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. In November 1999, NSC ceased operations, resulting in 1,800 remaining employees losing their jobs and Iligan City revenues dropping by 72 million pesos that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.

## Post-Closure Attempts and Lingering Impact

In 2004, a group from India, Global Steel Philippines Inc (GSPI), purchased NSC's idle assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. These investors were later linked to Middle Steel of Archer Middle, then the world's second-largest steel company, suggesting legitimate experience this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>. Despite this, GSPI failed to take off due to a chronic lack of funds, unsuccessful attempts to secure additional government support, and an adversarial relationship with the local community and government, leading to another closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>.

The [[economic_and_social_impact_of_national_steel_corporations_closure | decline and fall of NSC]] reverberated across Iligan City and its supporting industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>. Losses to supporting businesses were estimated at 1.4 billion pesos annually, with local scrap metal collectors, service contractors, and the power utility suffering the heaviest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>. While cheap imports contributed to the decline of NSC's core markets, the company was still profitable until 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. Ultimately, its downfall was attributed to falling into the hands of incompetent management teams before succumbing to an unprecedented financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.

Today, the 145-hectare plant and its adjacent 600-unit housing complex sit unused in Iligan City, most recently serving as a quarantine center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>. Proposals for revival emerge from time to time, but none have succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>.

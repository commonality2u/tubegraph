Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) is China's ambitious initiative to rival ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The company has gained significant attention and support in Chinese media, particularly due to recent high-profile export bans to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This article examines SMEE's history, production capabilities, and current status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Information about SMEE relies heavily on a deep-dive profile by EqualOcean, and for other details, China-based sources were primarily used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Historical Context of Chinese Lithography

China's first lithography machine, the GK3, was developed in 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Two years later, it evolved into the JKG3, the first domestically created lithography machine for large-scale commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

The GK4 prototype, a contact lithography machine, emerged in 1978 and could print chips on 75 millimeter wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Contact lithography, where the photo mask directly touches the photoresist-coated substrate, is known for high defect rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. At this point, China was approximately two decades behind the United States, which invented and commercialized contact lithography in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Following contact lithography, the next commercial stages included the proximity aligner (introducing a gap between mask and substrate) and the step-and-scan device, or stepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. China attempted to develop both simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

*   In 1981, the Institute of Semiconductors of the Chinese Academy of Sciences successfully developed two proximity aligner prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   In 1985, after six years of work, the 45th Institute of the Ministry of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering developed its own stepper, "inspired" by the US-based GCA's 4800 DSW, which printed designs using the 436 nanometer g-line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

By 2000, China began research on machines utilizing argon fluoride (ArF) lasers on the 193 nanometer wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This marked a significant [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | technology gap]], as Western companies had been shipping their first such devices since 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Founding and Mandate of SMEE

SMEE was founded in March 2002, indicating a shift in government strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. China's 12th five-year plan (2011-2015) designated lithography as the second-highest priority among 16 major national special projects, known as the "Zero Two Special Project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

The "Zero Two Special Project" had several goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>:
*   Develop manufacturing equipment for 22 to 45 nanometer processed chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   Conduct forward research on 14 to 22 nanometer processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Work on 65 to 90 nanometer special processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   Capture at least 10% of the domestic lithography market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   Attempt to enter the international market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

SMEE was appointed as the national champion to achieve these objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The company's first office was in the Shanghai Zhangjiang High-Tech Park, neighboring other semiconductor companies like SMIC and Spreadtrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Ha Rongming, SMEE's founding general manager and chairman, was noted for his intense dedication, working from 7 AM to 10 PM daily, with guaranteed work on Saturdays and often Sundays for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## SMEE's Development and Strategy

Over two decades, SMEE has prioritized extensive R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. As of 2019, the company had filed over 3,000 patents, securing 1,600 of them, with nearly 700 patents in foreign countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. SMEE has received substantial support from both local and central Chinese governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. The Shanghai SASAC, overseeing the city's corporate assets, is SMEE's largest owner with 32% of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Market Entry Strategy
Given that lithography technology is a highly protected space dominated by a few government-backed companies, SMEE faced import restrictions from its inception, particularly for high-level optics from Carl Zeiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. To circumvent this, SMEE initially targeted segments of the lithography market with less intense competition and stricter requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

Their initial focus was on lithography for advanced packaging processes, which involve placing a chip in its protective casing and connecting it to the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This "cut its teeth" strategy allowed SMEE to gain experience in back-end lithography before attempting to move into front-end lithography, where the leading companies operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This strategy has proven successful: SMEE products hold 80% of the domestic back-end lithography market, accounting for 40% of the global market in 2019, shipping over 50 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Major back-end customers include Changjiang Electric Group, Taiwan-based ASE Group, and Tongfu Microelectronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

SMEE subsequently expanded into lithography tools for other niche semiconductor products, such as power devices, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and LEDs, with LEDs being a particularly promising market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Finally, the company began developing front-end lithography tools for companies like Yangtze Memory and potentially SMIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## Business Model: Following the ASML Model

Unlike its Japanese competitors, Canon and Nikon, SMEE is structured similarly to ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. It aims to be the final system integrator for lithography tool components, working with various suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

The core factors for a lithography machine's success include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>:
1.  High-precision optics
2.  The light source
3.  High-precision mechanics
4.  Software

ASML, for instance, relies on companies like Cymer for its light source and a joint venture with Carl Zeiss for optics, often holding significant equity in or outright owning these critical component suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### Domestic Supplier Challenges
EqualOcean identifies SMEE's equivalents for Carl Zeiss as Changchun Optotech and Beijing Guowang Technology Company, though Changchun Optotech is no longer associated with SMEE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Beijing Guowang is building an optics manufacturing factory, which means they likely won't supply immersion-ready optical systems in mass until its completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. SMEE's equivalent for Cymer is Beijing RS Laser Opto-Electronics Technology, whose product is currently underpowered compared to ASML's immersion systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

A significant [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenge]] for SMEE is the requirement for domestic suppliers for all components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Many core technologies still need to be imported or purchased from foreign companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. For example:
*   **Photomasks**: The vast majority are made by Japanese companies Toppan Printing and Dai Nippon Printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. While a Chinese company, Jiangsu Nata Opto-Electronic Material Company Limited (NATA), has created a photomask that works in an ASML immersion system, this is just one example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Other Components**: Ball bearings from Sweden, valves from France, and grating alignment systems from the United States are not made in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Without these, it's difficult to ship a commercial-grade, working machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## Current Capabilities and Future Pipeline

As of August 2021, SMEE systems are capable of 90 nanometer, 110 nanometer, and 280 nanometer processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. These are primarily specialized systems for back-end lithography, LEDs, MEMS, and power devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

Lithography systems are generally categorized by their laser light source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>:
*   Eyeline machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>
*   Krypton fluoride laser machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
*   Argon fluoride laser machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
*   Argon fluoride immersion laser machines (ArF immersion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>
*   EUV machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>

The majority of SMEE's systems use eyeline and krypton fluoride lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Their most advanced system, the SSA/600-20 scanner for front-end manufacturing at the 90 nanometer node, uses an argon fluoride (ArF) laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. A prototype of this product, the 600-10, was first profiled in 2011, with a field size of 22x32 millimeters and processing about 50 wafers an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Comparable Canon and Nikon machines can process up to five times that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Over ten years later, only one more iteration (600-20) has been made, and as of 2019, it is not selling in relevant quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. SMEE's recent sales are still largely in outdated eyeline lithography machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

The most anticipated development in SMEE's future pipeline is an ArF immersion (ArF-e) system, said to be capable of the 28 nanometer process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This 28 nanometer tool is currently a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. China has a history of building prototypes that lag the leading edge by about 10 years, and the 28 nanometer node, which began shipping around 2011, fits this pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

A major [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenge]] is transitioning from prototype to high-volume commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. China has historically struggled to turn prototypes into commercially competitive products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. The goal was to deliver commercial-ready 28 nanometer ArF-e machines in 2021 or 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, but this deadline is likely to be missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Beijing Guowang, a critical optics supplier, is building a foundry for SMEE's optical systems, but its construction is not expected to be completed until September 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Considering integration lags, a 2024 ship date might be ambitious, and even then, the product is not expected to be commercially competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## Exaggerated Claims and Reality

Chinese media often reports revolutionary [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | advancements]] that are not yet commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. For example, in November 2018, the Institute of Opto-Electronics Technology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced a 22 nanometer "super resolution" lithography tool, with CCTV claiming multi-patterning could achieve sub-10 nanometer levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. However, this tool was far from commercially ready, with low accuracy and a field of view of just a few square millimeters, meaning it would take an extremely long time to process a single wafer layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. By contrast, ASML's Twinscan NXT:1970Ci, a comparable DUV machine for 38 nanometer nodes and below, offers an 858 square millimeter field of view and can process over 250 wafers an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## Human Capital and Working Environment

A significant [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenge]] for SMEE, compared to ASML, is attracting and retaining top talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. While Chinese companies are known for offering high sums to engineers, this doesn't seem to apply universally to SMEE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

*   Entry-level college graduates at SMEE earn about $45,000 USD per year, with PhDs making roughly double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   SMEE's average PhD salary is comparable to ASML's company-wide average salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. However, ASML staff software engineers can make nearly $200,000 USD annually, indicating a significant pay gap, even considering cost of living differences between Shanghai and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

Furthermore, ASML offers substantial benefits, including share purchase plans, pension plans, commuting allowances, 40 days of paid leave, and an 8% holiday allowance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. SMEE, as a "national champion" bearing expectations similar to Huawei, cannot match ASML's generosity due to its comparatively smaller capital base (ASML is valued at $300 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

SMEE has adopted Huawei's working practices, which include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>:
*   Long working hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
*   Considerable political intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   Tough annual assessments for bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.
*   A Jack Welch-style "bottom 5-10% layoff" each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

This approach, based on comments from Chinese message boards and job sites, is likely to hinder SMEE's ability to acquire and retain the high-level talent crucial for the semiconductor manufacturing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

## Outlook and [[Future prospects for Chinese semiconductor manufacturing | Future Prospects]]

Chinese media often portrays the photolithography effort as the "Mount Everest of the intelligent manufacturing industry," with significant cheerleading and optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Despite rhetoric suggesting "nothing that can't be done by us Chinese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, the reality is that SMEE is at least 20 years behind ASML in delivering a commercial-ready, upper-class lithography device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Immersion lithography is still nascent for SMEE, and EUV is even further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. This reality is acknowledged even by Chinese sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Exaggerated claims are seen as counterproductive, leading to pessimism when deadlines are missed and hindering problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

However, the Chinese semiconductor production equipment ecosystem is not without promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Progress in back-end lithography and LED lithography is encouraging, especially as China expands its market share in the display industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Some Chinese companies have established strong track records in specific semiconductor equipment areas, with one even securing TSMC as a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

SMEE is reportedly considering an IPO in the [[future_prospects_for_chinese_semiconductor_manufacturing | future]], at valuations estimated between $5 billion and $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. An IPO would provide new information through a prospectus, potentially allowing for an update on SMEE's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

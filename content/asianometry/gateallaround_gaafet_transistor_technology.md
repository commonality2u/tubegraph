TSMC's upcoming N2 process node is one of its most ambitious, with plans for three new N2 fabs in Hsinchu, Kaohsiung, and Taichung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. A key feature of this new N2 process is a special type of transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

In 2011, the semiconductor industry transitioned from planar transistors to 3D ones, known as [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | FinFET]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Over ten years later, TSMC is joining Samsung and Intel in another major transition to the vertically-stacked, gate-all-around, nanosheet/nanowire metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or GAAFET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Beginnings

A transistor is fundamentally an actively controlled switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. It has a source and a drain, created by doping regions of silicon with a dopant element implanted using ion implantation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Between the source and drain lie the gate and the gate oxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. These components sit atop and control the channel through "capacitive coupling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

When the gate receives a specific voltage (the threshold voltage), it "turns on" or "opens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This action allows electrons or electron holes to flow from the source to the drain along the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This control of a material's conductivity is known as the "field effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The term "semiconductor" arises because the material conducts only part of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Therefore, the device is called a Field Effect Transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Early gates were made from metal, though many modern gates use polycrystalline silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The combination of a metal gate and gate oxide gives us "metal oxide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Putting it all together, we have the "metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor," or MOSFET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. While MOSFETs are the most common design, other types exist, such as bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), named for their three regions of alternatively doped silicon or germanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Transistors are used in integrated circuits (ICs) to design logic gates and memory blocks like SRAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Short Channel Effects

Ideally, a transistor would switch instantly with zero current flow when closed and no resistance when open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. However, after decades of shrinking planar MOSFETs, "short-channel effects" began to manifest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. These effects appear in two primary forms:

1.  **Threshold Voltage Roll-Off**: As the channel length decreased, the threshold voltage (the voltage at which the gate opens) was no longer constant. Instead, it started decreasing or "rolling off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This exacerbates "sub-threshold leakage," a residual current that flows even when the gate's voltage is below the threshold, leading to increased power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
2.  **Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL)**: When the source and drain are too close, electrons from the source can diffuse into the drain, even "burrowing under the gate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. DIBL causes a tiny parasitic current flow, meaning the transistor consumes power even when on standby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

These two short-channel effects, multiplied across billions of transistors, lead to significant power consumption problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Going Multigate

Short channel effects stem from interference by the electric fields from the source and drain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The original planar gate, sitting on top of the channel, only controls it from one side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The source and drain's electric fields encroach horizontally into the channel, diminishing the gate's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

For years, the industry managed these effects by lowering voltage, heavily doping the channel, or reducing source/drain depths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. A significant advancement was replacing silicon dioxide gate oxides with materials having a higher dielectric constant (High-K) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This strengthened the gate's capacitance, allowing its electric field to dominate the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Intel's use of High-K dielectrics like hafnium oxide in 2007 (High-K metal gate) paved the way for advanced atomic layer deposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

However, these methods have reached their limits, necessitating entirely new structures to regain channel control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. In 1984, Japanese researchers Sekigawa and Hayashi proposed "multi-gate" transistors, specifically a "double-gate MOS" or XMOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This concept led to the [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | FinFET]], which wraps the gate around the channel (the "fin") on three sides to intensify control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Intel produced the first commercial [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | FinFET]] devices in 2011 at the 22nm process node, with TSMC and Samsung following in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Gate All Around

The GAAFET expands on the [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | FinFET]] by completely wrapping the gate around the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This "gate all around" concept was first introduced in a 1990 paper by Jean Pierre Colinge and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. GAAFET describes a class of transistors where the gates fully surround the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

Within the GAAFET category, there are two main sub-categories:
*   **Nanowires** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>: Channels are rounder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Smaller channels give gates more control over electron flow but can impede flow when the gate is open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This necessitates stacking nanowires, but too many too high can interfere with interconnect layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Nanosheets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>: Channels are sheet-shaped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Fabricating a GAAFET

The fabrication process for a [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | FinFET]] was largely similar to planar transistors, reflecting the semiconductor industry's evolutionary nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Key [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | FinFET]] steps included patterning dense fin bunches onto silicon substrates using double-patterning lithography, creating wells for source/drain, adding a temporary dummy gate, isolating the transistor, and then building the real gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. After this front-end process, interconnects are added for the back-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

The GAAFET process flow evolves from the [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | FinFET]]'s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. It involves:
1.  **Epitaxial Deposition**: Several layers of silicon and silicon-germanium are added on top of the silicon substrate using epitaxy, forming a "super-lattice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
2.  **Fin Production**: These layers are cut down to produce a "Fin" similar to the [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | FinFET]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Maintaining a high aspect ratio (tall and skinny) and preventing deformations are crucial, as they are for [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | FinFET]] fins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
3.  **Shallow Trench Isolation (STI)**: To prevent electrical cross-talk and aid in fin formation, trenches are patterned using lithography, dug with reactive ion etch, and then filled with oxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
4.  **Sacrificial Layer Etch**: The silicon-germanium layers are etched away, leaving the silicon layers suspended between the source and drain. This draws from MEMS "sacrificial layers" to suspend tiny structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
5.  **Gate Formation**: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is used to precisely apply one-atom-thick layers of metals or chemicals to surround the exposed channel wires and build the gate and gate oxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. The main [[Challenges and benefits of GAAFET over FinFET | challenge]] is correctly aligning the gate material around the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Once this is done, the rest of the gate can be built, similar to [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | FinFET]] and planar transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Gains

The transition to GAAFETs offers significant [[Challenges and benefits of GAAFET over FinFET | benefits]], similar to the shift from planar to [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | FinFET]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Power Draw**: A 2020 study found that a nanosheet GAAFET draws about 20-35% less power than a [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | FinFET]] when turned off, depending on device dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This power efficiency is particularly appealing for mobile and AI processing applications, where power is constrained or massive compute is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Speed**: Gains are about 10% at constant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Density**: Gains are about 15%, depending on the IC's mix of analog, digital, or SRAM transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

TSMC management has noted "a much higher level of customer interest and engagement at N2 as compared with N3 at a similar stage," suggesting strong adoption for GAAFETs in existing AI accelerator chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## Race to the Gate

TSMC has largely dominated the [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | FinFET]] era for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Samsung and Intel are now moving ahead to GAAFET in an effort to gain market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

*   **Samsung**: Has been researching GAAFET since at least 2003 with their multibridge-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. They began offering their first GAAFET process, SF3E, in mid-2022, primarily for crypto miner chips rather than major digital logic products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Samsung released their second-generation GAAFET node, SF3, in late 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **Intel**: Their GAAFET offering is named "RibbonFET" or "Nanoribbon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Their first process node to use it, 20A, is scheduled for mid-2024, followed by 18A, which is expected to restore Intel's leadership position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Intel's 20A and 18A GAAFET processes will also feature "Backside Power," which moves power lines underneath the silicon substrates to open up additional space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
*   **TSMC**: Their N2 process will not include backside power until about a year later with their second-generation N2 processes (N2P and N2X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Many view this as a significant advantage for Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

The [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | FinFET]]-to-GAAFET transition is seen as a potential turning point in foundry competition, with the first to ship in volume potentially gaining leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. The close similarities in process flows between [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | FinFET]] and GAAFET suggest that expertise in the former will aid in the latter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## Conclusion

While the planar transistor was a [[Leading edge vs trailing edge semiconductors | leading-edge]] architecture for 50 years, and the [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | FinFET]] for about ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>, the duration of GAAFET's [[Leading edge vs trailing edge semiconductors | leading-edge]] tenure is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

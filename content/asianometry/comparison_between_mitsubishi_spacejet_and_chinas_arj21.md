Japan's attempt to develop an indigenous regional jet, the [[History of Mitsubishi Regional Jet|Mitsubishi Regional Jet]] (MRJ), later rebranded as the [[Impact of Delays on Mitsubishi SpaceJet|Mitsubishi SpaceJet]], shares some timeline similarities with China's COMAC ARJ21 despite a different ultimate outcome. Both aimed to compete in the regional jet market, which saw new competition from various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Mitsubishi SpaceJet Development Timeline
Development on the [[Impact of Delays on Mitsubishi SpaceJet|Mitsubishi SpaceJet]] was officially frozen in 2020, following six delays, over ten years of development, and nearly nine billion dollars spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The program has not been revived since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

Key milestones and delays for the [[Impact of Delays on Mitsubishi SpaceJet|Mitsubishi SpaceJet]]:
*   **Program Start**: Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) initiated a five-year, $400 million program in 2003 to study an indigenous regional jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was selected to lead the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Official Launch**: The program was officially launched in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Original Target Launch**: The 2008 plan aimed for a 2013 launch date with a development budget of about $1.3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **First Flight**: The first flight occurred in November 2015 at Nagoya Airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This was six years after the project's 2008 start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.
*   **Delivery Targets**:
    *   Original: Early 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
    *   After delays: Mid-2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>, then mid-2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, Q3 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>, mid-2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>, and finally 2021 or beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

## China's COMAC ARJ21 Development Timeline
The COMAC ARJ21, China's indigenous regional jet, followed a different path:
*   **Program Start**: The ARJ21 program began in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
*   **Maiden Flight**: The ARJ21 made its maiden flight in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>, six years after its program start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
*   **First Commercial Flight**: The ARJ21's first commercial flight occurred in 2016, eight years after its maiden flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

## Comparative Analysis

| Feature                  | [[Impact of Delays on Mitsubishi SpaceJet|Mitsubishi SpaceJet]] (MRJ)                  | COMAC ARJ21                                  |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| Program Start Date       | 2003 (study), 2008 (official launch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> | 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>              |
| Maiden Flight (Time from Program Start) | November 2015 (approx. 6 years from official launch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a> | 2008 (6 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a> |
| First Commercial Flight  | Never achieved due to program pause/freezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> | 2016 (8 years after maiden flight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a> |

While both programs took approximately six years from their respective starts to achieve their maiden flights, the [[Impact of Delays on Mitsubishi SpaceJet|SpaceJet]] faced numerous delays that ultimately prevented its commercial launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The ARJ21, on the other hand, made its first commercial flight in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

The transcript suggests that "were not for the pandemic, the [[Impact of Delays on Mitsubishi SpaceJet|SpaceJet]] might have had a chance to beat that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a> (referring to the ARJ21's commercial flight timeline). However, the program's liquidation and a three-year pause meant a "massive loss of experience, talent, and resources," effectively rendering the program "functionally dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

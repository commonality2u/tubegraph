Starting in the early 2000s, reports emerged of abnormal numbers of PC motherboards with leaking or popping capacitors, leading to computer failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This widespread issue became known as the "Capacitor Plague" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Capacitor Industry Market
The Aluminium E-cap industry is a multi-billion dollar market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. In 2002, it was valued at approximately $3 to $3.5 billion, and by today's estimates from various market analysts, it is worth about $5 to $6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

E-cap suppliers are primarily from Japan, Taiwan, or China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. These regions produce literally billions of units each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. For instance, in 2002, Taiwan alone manufactured 22.5 billion E-caps, accounting for 30% of the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## The Rubycon Story: A Case of [[industrial_espionage_and_its_impact_on_the_capacitor_industry | Industrial Espionage]]
A widely reported story concerning these failures, first published by Dennis Zogbi in "Passive Component Industry" magazine in late 2002, implicates [[industrial_espionage_and_its_impact_on_the_capacitor_industry | industrial espionage]] as a cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The narrative suggests:
*   A materials scientist from Japanese electronics company Rubycon Corporation left to work for Taiwan's Luminous Town Electric's factory in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   This scientist replicated Rubycon's P-50 water-based electrolyte formula for Luminous Town, which initially seemed to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   Subsequently, some of the scientist's staffers defected from Luminous Town, taking the electrolyte formula with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   They then either sold the formula directly to Taiwanese E-cap companies or to an electrolyte provider for resale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   The critical issue was that the defecting staffers did not possess the complete formula, missing essential additives known as "depolarizers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   This omission led to hydrogen gas build-up within the E-caps, causing them to rupture or burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. The lack of depolarizer made the electrolyte too alkaline, dissolving the dielectric and creating hydrogen gas from reactions with underlying aluminum foil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

While Luminous Town did not deny the theft of the formulation from Rubycon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, they clarified they did not produce any of the faulty electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Dennis Zogbi's story quoted anywhere from 5 to 11 Taiwanese producers as being affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. He stated that "anybody who uses contract manufacturers that outsource to Taiwan was affected by the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This incident is generally believed to have occurred in mid-2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

The IEEE Spectrum magazine reported that the failed E-caps often bore unknown brands like "Tayeh", "Choyo", or "Chhsi", or were unmarked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Fallout and Industry Admissions
Several computer manufacturers acknowledged issues with Taiwanese E-cap failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   IBM admitted that a small number of desktop PCs (less than 1%) were returned due to capacitor-induced short circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   Taiwanese motherboard maker ABIT stated they were switching from Taiwanese to Japanese suppliers in response to the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. ABIT was sued for selling defective capacitors as early as 1999 and subsequently settled, repairing the faulty boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The cost of these repairs may have contributed to their exit from the motherboard business in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   Lien Yan, an electrolyte company accused of buying the flawed formula, denied the accusations, stating it heavily damaged their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. They claimed the Rubycon story was FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) spread by the Japanese to regain business from Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   Luxon, a major Taiwanese capacitor supplier, blamed Lien Yan for the drama and emphasized their company's practice of self-developing their electrolyte for reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

Later, in 2005, another wave of bulging capacitors affected Apple, Hewlett-Packard, and especially Dell computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Dell shipped 11.8 million OptiPlex PCs between May 2003 and July 2005 with faulty capacitors that were 10 times more likely to bulge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Dell was sued in 2007 for trying to conceal the issue and spent $300 million on replacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. All these bad capacitors came from a single manufacturer: Nichicon in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. Industry insiders told Dennis Zogbi that the Nichicon bad products were made by a Taiwanese sub-contractor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

## Counterfeiting and Supply Chain Complexity
Dennis Zogbi also highlighted the increasing complexity of the supply chain in 2003, with brand-name companies outsourcing E-cap production to no-name suppliers offering the cheapest prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. This dynamic created opportunities for counterfeits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

When supply chains are disrupted, OEMs face pressure to source parts quickly, potentially leading them to buy from unauthorized distributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. This can result in the purchase of counterfeit capacitors that do not last as long as genuine ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. A 2014 study of counterfeit Nichicon E-caps, found after the March 2011 earthquake disrupted the legitimate supply chain, revealed that the counterfeit water-based electrolytes lacked enough ethylene glycol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. This deficiency lowered the electrolyte's boiling point, making it unstable at higher temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.

While the "Rubycon Incident" of [[industrial_espionage_and_its_impact_on_the_capacitor_industry | industrial espionage]] remains a popular explanation for the Capacitor Plague, the widespread nature of the failures and varying timelines suggest it was likely an extended series of unconnected [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | challenges]] faced by the capacitor industry, exacerbated by complex supply chains, outsourcing, and potential counterfeiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

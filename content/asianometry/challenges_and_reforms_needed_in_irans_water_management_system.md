Iran faces a long-running and complex water problem, rooted in its historically arid climate and low rainfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Much of the country's central land is uninhabitable without water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Over the years, Iran developed an expansive industrial water system to irrigate its dry soil and support a growing population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, this system has led to significant issues in the country's water management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Water Availability and Climate
Iran ranks 158th out of 189 countries in terms of annual average precipitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
Key precipitation statistics include:
*   75% of precipitation falls on just 25% of the country's area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   50% of rainfall occurs during winter months, with only 4% during summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   Central deserts receive less than 50 millimeters of rainfall annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

While Iran borders the Caspian Sea (the world's largest inland body of water) to the north, its water is brackish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman to the south cover a quarter of Iran's land but hold nearly half of its renewable water resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Large mountains facing these water bodies create seasonal rivers from melting snow, but most rivers, except for the Karun, have basically no flow during summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Iran's 10 lakes are mostly very salty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Ultimately, less than 1% of Iran's 1.6 million square kilometers is surface water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Historical Water Management and Decline
Iran's water scarcity is not new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Ancient Persians, around 3,000 years ago, pioneered a sophisticated water supply system called the "qanat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. A qanat is an underground tunnel that brought snowmelt water from mountains to plains using gravity, preventing evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. These systems were successful and spread throughout the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, with knowledge passed down through generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This prudent [[irans_historical_water_management_and_its_evolution | Water Management]] enabled the success of the Achaemenid Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. By the 1900s, Tehran and other central cities relied on thousands of kilometers of qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

However, the qanats faced challenges:
*   **Growing Population Needs:** Water needs surpassed the qanats' supply capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Modernization Push:** After World War I, Reza Shah Pahlavi's government settled nomadic populations, requiring new consistent water sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Introduction of Modern Wells:** Iran's first modern water well was built in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Drilling wells for groundwater with electrical pumps was quicker and cheaper than building or extending qanats, which could take years and significant manual labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This led authorities to push for modern systems, causing qanats to fall into disrepair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Land Reform's Impact:** The 1963 "White Revolution" land reform transferred agricultural lands from landlords to peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Previously, landlords maintained qanats, but no centralized authority competently took over this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. The Iranian Ministry of Water and Power, established in 1964, did not prioritize qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. By 2000, less than 10% of Iran's water came from qanats, down from 75% in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Modern Water Management Challenges
The shift to modern systems brought new challenges.

### Over-reliance on Hydraulic Mega Projects
With only 10.5% of its land arable, Iran built dams and pumped groundwater to irrigate land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. 19 new dam projects were initiated before 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This industrial-level water management system expanded irrigated lands significantly, from 8,000 to 22,662 square kilometers between 1968 and 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
Iran has continued to build dams, now having over 588 big and small dams and about 100 more under construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. However, [[environmental_impact_of_irans_dam_and_agricultural_projects | damming is controversial]] due to its widespread environmental effects, including damage from water impoundment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. For example, the Upper Gotvand Dam, completed in 2012, accumulated over 66.5 million tons of salt, raising soil salinity in surrounding areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

### Population Growth and Food Self-Sufficiency
After the Islamic Revolution, policies encouraged rapid population growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Iran's population grew by an average of 1 million people each year over three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, reaching 88.5 million by the end of 2022 â€“ more than four times the 1960 population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

Trade restrictions and the Iran-Iraq War intensified Iran's drive for food self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Crop production grew 175% from 1980 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, with cereals like wheat, barley, and rice being major crops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. By 2012, Iran was the 12th largest wheat producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Inefficient Agricultural Water Use
Agriculture accounts for 93% of all water used in Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. The government heavily subsidized water and fertilizer costs and guaranteed food purchase prices, which led to inefficient water use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:11:05]</a>. Iran's average irrigation efficiency is under 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, largely because over 70% of land uses surface irrigation, resulting in substantial water loss to evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This inefficiency has hurt agricultural productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Despite these efforts, Iran is still not completely food self-sufficient, importing 1.8 million tons of wheat from Russia in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

### Fragmented Governance
Water resource management in Iran became messy after the Islamic Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. It devolved from a single centralized body to several: one department and four ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Health and Medical Education:** Sets drinking water quality standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Energy:** Allocates water for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use; regulates wastewater and hydropower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Agriculture Jihad:** Allocates water among farmers and collects water fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This ministry is a result of a 2001 merger with the Ministry of Construction Jihad, which built water infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   **Department of Environment:** Controls water pollution, prepares policies, and assesses hydropower and irrigation projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
This divided responsibility prevents an integrated approach to water supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

### Environmental Consequences of Mismanagement
The combination of agricultural demand and increasing development has severely drained Iran's surface water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **Lake Urmia:** Once the largest lake in Iran and the Middle East, it has shrunk aggressively due to persistent [[effects_of_climate_change_and_drought_on_irans_water_resources | drought]] and water mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. A massive bridge project completed in the early 2000s cut the lake in half, accelerating its shrinkage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. It is now a tenth of its former size, with its dry lake bed causing huge salt storms that ruin nearby farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **Hamoun Lake:** Eastern Iran's largest freshwater body, it vanished entirely during a severe drought in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. The dry lake bed led to big dust storms, a serious health hazard, requiring the evacuation of 124 surrounding villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **[[groundwater_overextraction_and_its_consequences_in_iran | Groundwater Overextraction]]:** Groundwater has become Iran's primary water source, accounting for 55% of total supply in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. A 2021 study estimated that over 74 cubic kilometers of water were pulled from the ground between 2002 and 2015 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:17:07]</a>.
    *   **Illegal Wells:** From 1979 to 2013, the number of wells in Iran grew from 47,000 to 789,000, almost all of which are illegal, with little enforcement of regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
    *   **Declining Water Table:** As more groundwater is withdrawn, the water table declines, forcing people to drill deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, especially during serious droughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
    *   **Increased Salinity:** The soil and groundwater become saltier; for example, electrical conductivity measurements are 85% higher in areas like the Karkheh Basin, a major agricultural area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
    *   **Subsidence:** Declining groundwater levels cause the ground to literally sink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Iran's land is shrinking at an average of about six centimeters per year, with some areas reaching 19 centimeters a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. This damages infrastructure like transmission lines, bridges, and buildings, and undermines structural safety, especially during earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. Subsidence also permanently damages the aquifer's capacity to carry water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

## Reforms Needed
While Iran's massive population contributes to the issue by meaning less renewable water per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, the core of Iran's water crisis lies in demand and mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
The Iranian government has recently tried to tackle the water issue by growing supply rather than cutting demand, prioritizing more infrastructure and building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. High-profile desalination plants are being built on the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf to meet urban water demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, but transporting this water to central cities is expensive, and desalinated water is not economically viable for agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

Difficult decisions will need to be made regarding water usage in homes, industry, and most importantly, farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Reforms to improve farming efficiency face challenges because agriculture employs 23% of Iran's population, and the government is sensitive to rural issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Implementing these reforms without alienating large segments of the population will be difficult for a populist government operating one of the world's most heavily subsidized economies amidst a turbulent climate and political situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. However, the long-term costs of this water mismanagement are heavy, and long-term reforms are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

For a long time, two companies, Eastman Kodak and Fujifilm, dominated the silver-based photographic film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While Fujifilm successfully navigated the [[digital_photography_disruption | digital transition]] to become a larger, transformed company, Kodak did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Initial Dominance and Resources

In 1963, Kodak generated revenues of $1.1 billion, vastly surpassing Fujifilm's $75 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Kodak had a globally recognized brand and seemingly unlimited resources, including its own silver mine and cattle ranch for film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. In the Japanese market, Japanese consumers often saw Kodak as a superior brand compared to Fujifilm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

The [[kodak_and_fujifilm_rivalry | rivalry between Kodak and Fujifilm]] was legendary, marked by competition in price, sponsorships, and even in court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Awareness of Digital Future

Both Kodak and Fujifilm recognized early on that the future was in [[digital_photography_disruption | digital imaging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. As early as 1975, a Kodak employee, Steve Sasson, assembled the first [[traditional_vs_digital_cameras | digital camera]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This early prototype weighed 8 pounds and was the size of a toaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Kodak employees predicted that by the 2000s, silver-based imaging products would no longer exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Kodak scientists also produced high-quality image sensors, including a 1.4 million pixel CCD sensor in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## Failure to Adapt and Diversify

Despite early innovation, Kodak's explorations into [[digital_photography_disruption | digital photography]] often resulted in patents but not new, successful businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The company struggled to move beyond its incredibly successful traditional film business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. They never settled on a plan for Kodak in the digital era and hesitated to pursue ventures that didn't align with their existing model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

### Missed Opportunities in Diversification

*   **Printers**: In 1976, Kodak had the Ektaprint, a microprocessor-equipped printer that was simpler and more reliable than its rival at Xerox, but they failed to aggressively pursue this market due to unfamiliarity with the business model of renting out heavy equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Previous Diversification Efforts**: Prior CEO Colby Chandler attempted diversification into floppy disks, batteries, artificial snow, and pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. However, his successors reversed this strategy, doubling down on imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
*   **Selling Off Valuable Assets**:
    *   In 1993, Kodak spun off its specialty chemical business, which generated eight percent of its sales from non-Kodak sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. Today, Eastman Chemical is a $10 billion Fortune 500 company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
    *   Kodak also sold its Sterling Winthrop drug unit, including its over-the-counter consumer drugs business like Bayer Aspirin, which was generating over $1 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.
    *   Though Kodak had researched and filed pharmaceutical and medical equipment patents around the same time as Fujifilm, they withdrew from these ventures in 1996 to focus on photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

### Focus on "Imaging Company"

Kodak doubled down on photography, dubbing themselves an "imaging company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. They tried to develop or promote new digital technologies to fulfill their customers' imaging needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

*   **Digital Cameras**: In 2001, Kodak released the EasyShare digital camera, which sold well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. They even held leading market share in the U.S. [[traditional_vs_digital_cameras | digital camera]] space between 2004-2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. However, like Fujifilm, Kodak learned that digital cameras were a "terrible business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. Other companies entered the market, and Kodak's share plummeted to seven percent by 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. Kodak made more money from licensing its [[digital_photography_disruption | digital technology]] patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
*   **Inkjet Printers**: In 2005, Kodak entered the inkjet printer business, competing with well-funded giants like Hewlett-Packard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. This venture led to significant net losses of $1.2 billion in 2005 and $691 million in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Division Sale**: In 2007, the company sold its last valuable asset, its healthcare division, which included radiology and medical printing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

## Financial Decline and Bankruptcy

Saddled with high debt and pension liabilities, Kodak struggled for five more years before filing for bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. From 2005 to 2010, Kodak's sales declined from $11 billion to $5.9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

## Fundamental Difference: A Consumer Brand vs. A Technology Company

The core difference between Kodak and Fujifilm's fates seems to stem from their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. Kodak was primarily a consumer brand with a strong technology base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. In contrast, Fujifilm began as a technology company that happened to sell to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. When their consumer businesses vanished, Fujifilm found it easier to return to its roots and diversify into new areas, relying on its chemical expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

Kodak and Fujifilm's original success was rooted in their expertise in chemistry and manufacturing precision chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. However, they lacked expertise in producing semiconductors or electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Fujifilm recognized this and moved on, while Kodak decided it could not or should not do the same, ultimately failing to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), also known as North Korea, has long aimed for self-sufficiency in food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Reliable information about the country's agricultural situation is scarce, often relying on anecdotes and rumors due to the government's lack of credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## [[impact_of_geography_and_climate_on_north_korean_agriculture | Geographic and Climatic Challenges]]

Historically, the northern part of Korea was its industrial heartland, while the south served as its breadbasket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. North Korea's [[impact_of_geography_and_climate_on_north_korean_agriculture | geography]] presents significant agricultural challenges:
*   **Mountainous Terrain**: 80% of North Korea's land is composed of mountains and uplands, with deep valleys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The majority of the country's 25 million people live on the coastal plains and lowlands of the west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Arable Land**: Only about 15% of the country's land is arable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. While this is above the global average of 10% (Taiwan has 17%), most farms are concentrated on the west coast where conditions are more favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Harsh Climate**: The cropping season is generally short, with harsh winters, and short, hot, humid, and rainy summers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. 60% of the DPRK's rain falls between June and September, with the remaining 40% widely distributed and sporadic, making the country vulnerable to droughts and floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. These extreme weather events are exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure and deforestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Historical Context and [[economic_policies_and_their_influence_on_north_korean_agriculture | Economic Policies]]

Upon its founding, the DPRK's Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) inherited an industrialized society from the Japanese occupation, holding 72% of the peninsula's industrial capacity and over 90% of its hydroelectric capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The WPK regime seized industries and redistributed land from Korean landlords and Japanese colonialists to the peasantry in 1945-1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### The [[korean_war_and_nuclear_threats | Korean War]] and Collectivization
The [[korean_war_and_nuclear_threats | Korean War]] (1950-1953) devastated the peninsula, annihilating industrial infrastructure and causing immense population upheaval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Post-war, North Korea sought aid and guidance from China and the Soviet Union, leveraging their deteriorating relations for maximum concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

Domestically, the DPRK adopted a Soviet-style centrally planned economy aimed at suppressing markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The state owned all businesses, provided all jobs, seized all land, and established cooperative and state farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Farmers were prohibited from working on private plots, and the state confiscated all food grown for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

Eternal Leader Kim Il-sung pushed for this collectivization to achieve food self-reliance, aligning with the country's official state ideology of political independence and self-reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This drive, criticized even by communist bloc peers, led to food shortages in the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. In response, the government heavily promoted the use of fertilizers, pesticides, tractors, and irrigation systems, stabilizing yields but making the sector dangerously dependent on raw inputs like oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_reforms_in_north_koreas_agricultural_sector | Agricultural Challenges and Reforms]]

North Korea accumulated vast debts to the Soviet Union and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. When the Soviets withdrew subsidies in 1987, the DPRK instituted agricultural reforms, doubling down on double cropping and fertilizers, raising forests, reclaiming tidal land, and clearing hillsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. These intense practices led to soil depletion and acidification, and the new land was marginal, meaning food production still fell short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### The Great Famine of the 1990s
The collapse of the Soviet Union caused North Korea to lose its main source of coal, oil, and steel, which had accounted for up to two-thirds of its two-way trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The loss of oil severely impacted fertilizer production and irrigation infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

By 1993, China provided 77% of North Korea's fuel and 68% of its food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. However, China began experiencing its own grain issues in 1994 and cut back trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. That same year, North Korean radio began admitting to hunger while denying its seriousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

Famine conditions likely began in certain provinces by 1993, with rations delayed or suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. In 1994, the government ended food shipments to four provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. By 1995, coercive grain seizures from farms began, and prison camps were established for those caught foraging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Refugees pouring into China led to horrific media reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

Severe flooding in 1995 and 1996 in the western provinces, where most farms are located, caused widespread damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The government claimed 5 million displaced people, over 1 million tons of grain lost, and $15 billion in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. However, food shortages existed long before the floods, and the government likely exaggerated the damage to save face and request aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

International food aid helped, but not all of it reached those most in need, leading many charitable organizations to withdraw due to disputes and lack of accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The exact scale of the famine, including death estimates (ranging from 220,000 to 3.5 million), remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Post-Famine Improvements and Continued [[challenges_and_reforms_in_north_koreas_agricultural_sector | Challenges]]
Since the 1990s, agricultural production has improved due to international aid, favorable weather, and [[economic_policies_and_their_influence_on_north_korean_agriculture | economic reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Much current information comes from international aid programs operating in the country since at least 2011, though still subject to interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

Post-famine, the government allowed households to own and cultivate private plots, where people grow potatoes, corn, and vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. These privately owned plots are well-cared for and have significantly improved food security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

In 2012, the Kim Jong-un government implemented [[economic_policies_and_their_influence_on_north_korean_agriculture | economic policy changes]] to devolve more authority to lower levels, allowing collective farm workers more decision-making power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. While not as extensive as China's agricultural reforms under Deng Xiaoping, this was a step forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. The extent of these reforms and their impact on the bottom line remain uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Deteriorating Soil Quality
One of North Korea's major agricultural concerns is its deteriorating soil quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Farmers aggressively plow and till their soil and use large amounts of chemical fertilizers, which have caused the soil to become acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This impedes the soil's ability to absorb air and water, and plants' ability to take up nutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

Aggressive double cropping, planting multiple crops in the same area or year, has further deteriorated the land's capacity to cultivate food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. North Korea's soils have a reddish hue due to a lack of organic matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. In 2011, the average yield of paddy rice was 3.9 tons per hectare, significantly down from 8.0 tons in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

To preserve soil quality, farmers should rotate in legumes, which improve soil nitrogen and water retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. However, farmers are reluctant to implement legume-based cropping schemes due to fear of not meeting government-set wheat production goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

### Lack of Technology and Deforestation
North Korea's farmers lack adequate farming technology, such as tractors suited for the country's small and irregularly shaped fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Even when technology is available, farmers often cannot run or maintain it due to shortages of energy or parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. This situation is largely due to the country's inability to raise funds for purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

In recent decades, the government has intensively tried to expand arable land by cutting down trees on hillsides to create terraces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. During the famine, cultivation was allowed on lands with slopes above 15%, despite their poor soil quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Satellite imagery shows that one million hectares of land on slopes above 10 degrees have been cleared for cereals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Without trees to hold soil, big rainstorms easily cause erosion and siltation, damaging growing capacity and making floods more dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Floods have become noticeably more destructive since these deforestation efforts began in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Deforestation also affects the population's ability to generate energy, as 77% of the rural population and 28% of the urban population rely on wood for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## Food Distribution and Markets

Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen noted that famines occur not only due to crop failures but also due to collapses in food distribution networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. During the DPRK's central planning era, the state collected all harvests and distributed food rations based on occupation and household size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

During the great famine, oil shortages made food distribution difficult, even when food was available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. The old food rationing system collapsed, leading ordinary North Koreans to resort to illegal private markets for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. These "black markets" are often run by women, primarily housewives trying to keep their families alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

After the famine subsided, the government initially cracked down on these markets but eventually formalized them, providing housing, facilities, and even security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Today, defector surveys indicate that most ordinary North Koreans get their food from these markets and private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. The government has attempted to revitalize the old food ration system, but defectors suggest it no longer provides rations as it once did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. It is believed that the state's retained 70% of state farmers' harvests now primarily go to political and economic elites to maintain their support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

The North Korean government's budget and resources have vastly depleted over the years, operating with an official budget of around $3.3 billion USD (2007 figure) and a nominal 2017 GDP of $30 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Kim Jong-un considers agricultural reform and revitalization a core policy, often speaking vaguely about improving lives through increased food production, proposing ideas like a "seed revolution" or more double cropping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. While distribution has improved and famine is no longer a major threat, the country still falls short of self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. The fundamental agricultural situation needs to change for North Koreans to consistently have enough food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

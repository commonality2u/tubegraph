Evergrande Group, a sprawling Chinese real estate company, has amassed billions of dollars in debt and faces a significant cash crunch, leading to widespread interest in its situation and the broader implications for China's economy [00:00:07]. The company, which was once China's biggest real estate conglomerate, now carries $300 billion in liabilities [00:00:35]. This crisis has brought the Chinese government's regulatory stance and its close ties with major corporations into sharp focus.

## Government Ties and Influence
Evergrande's founder and former chairman, Xu Jiayin, has maintained close ties to the Chinese government [00:17:13]. He is recognized as China's single most generous individual in terms of charity, having won the China Charity Award for eight consecutive years [00:17:19]. In both 2018 and 2019, he reportedly donated 4 billion RMB (approximately $620 million USD) in cash annually [00:17:32]. Such substantial contributions are believed to have bought him significant influence [00:17:40].

Xu Jiayin has previously leveraged these political ties to navigate trade winds and combat critics [00:17:51]. For example, when American short-selling firm Citron Research published a report in June 2012 claiming Evergrande was insolvent, Hong Kong authorities launched a civil case against its founder, Andrew Left [00:18:03]. Left was banned from trading in Hong Kong for five years in 2016, and his final appeal was lost in 2019 [00:18:12]. Left later admitted he "didn't know that Shu was so powerful at the time" [00:18:23].

## The "Three Red Lines" Policy
In August 2020, in response to concerns about possible contagion threats in China's financial sector and the massive debt accumulated by conglomerates like Evergrande, the Chinese government decided to act [00:24:02]. Two ministries passed regulations mandating what they called the "three red lines" for real estate companies [00:24:45]:
1.  **Liability-to-Asset Ratio**: A ceiling of 70% on the ratio of liabilities to assets (excluding advances from contracted projects) [00:24:52].
2.  **Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio**: A cap of 100% on the percentage of net debt to equity [00:25:01].
3.  **Cash-to-Short-Term Borrowings**: A requirement to hold at least one dollar of cash for each dollar borrowed in the short term [00:25:07].

Real estate companies that failed to meet these requirements would be prohibited from adding more debt to their books [00:25:12]. This policy was particularly severe for companies like [[history_and_growth_of_evergrande_group | Evergrande]], which relied on growth to mitigate difficult periods [00:25:22].

### Evergrande's Compliance Issues
At the time the "three red lines" policy was introduced, [[financial_strategies_and_challenges_faced_by_evergrande | Evergrande's financial metrics]] were far from compliant [00:25:27]:
*   **Liabilities to Asset Ratio**: 82% [00:25:31].
*   **Net Debt to Equity Ratio**: 199% [00:25:39].
*   **Cash to Short-Term Borrowings Ratio**: 0.4 [00:25:43].

This policy caught [[leadership_and_management_of_evergrande | Xu Jiayin]] and the company off guard [00:25:58]. Within weeks, Xu Jiayin announced an internal meeting that Evergrande would slash prices on its 600 new builds nationwide by 30% [00:26:04]. The goal was to achieve sales of 100 billion RMB (approximately $15.4 billion USD) each month [00:26:11].

## Seeking Government Support
In September 2020, a Chinese website leaked a letter reportedly sent by Evergrande to the Guangdong provincial government, titled "Report on Requesting Support for Major Asset Restructuring Projects" [00:26:38]. While Evergrande denied its authenticity, some news sources confirmed it [00:26:48]. The letter emphasized Evergrande's adherence to the central government's real estate price reduction policies [00:27:00]. It also casually noted that the company's interest-bearing liabilities had reached approximately 835 billion RMB (about $130 billion USD) [00:27:14]. This debt included significant amounts owed to 128 domestic banks (including Minsheng Bank and Agricultural Bank of China) and 121 non-banking entities [00:27:28].

The report requested the Guangdong government's help in coordinating a reorganization of Evergrande's various entities [00:27:56]. The letter warned that if the reorganization was not completed before February 2021, Evergrande would need to pay strategic investors 130 billion RMB ($20 billion USD) and 13.7 billion RMB ($2.2 billion USD) in dividends [00:28:11]. This could trigger a sudden cash flow crisis and jeopardize the company's financial health [00:28:26].

## Government's Stance on Bailout and Social Stability
The Chinese government generally does not bail out companies like Evergrande, viewing them differently from banks [00:32:21]. Instead, the expectation is that the company will undergo debt resolution in court and be slowly broken up [00:32:27]. This approach aligns with the government's overarching social equality goals, as lower real estate prices resulting from Evergrande's winding down could be seen as desirable [00:31:45].

A significant concern for the government is social unrest. Evergrande's high-yielding wealth management fund products, which were largely sold to employees who then resold them to friends and family, led to protests [00:29:25]. When two of Evergrande's affiliates missed repayments on these obligations on September 8, 2021, angry individuals protested at the company's headquarters [00:29:42]. Five days later, Evergrande announced repayment plans for these products, including cash, payment in kind (land), or credit for future home purchases [00:30:05].

Regulators are focused on fencing off the damage from Evergrande's crisis before it causes a systemic crisis of confidence [00:32:03]. They have a track record of handling other massive conglomerates in crisis, such as Anbang Insurance [00:32:13]. The question remains whether [[leadership_and_management_of_evergrande | Xu Jiayin]] will face charges for causing disruption to the government [00:32:20].

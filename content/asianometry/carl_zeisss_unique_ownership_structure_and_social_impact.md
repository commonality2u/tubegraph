Germany-based [[History of Carl Zeiss AG | Carl Zeiss AG]] is described as a fascinating company, even without considering its role in advanced optics for semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Beyond its technological prowess, the company possesses a unique ownership structure and a history deeply intertwined with social reforms.

## The Carl Zeiss Foundation

Following the death of its founder, Carl Zeiss, in 1888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, Dr. Ernst Abbe took sole ownership of the company from Carl's son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Abbe then transferred his ownership to what is now known as the Carl Zeiss Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Social Reforms and Economic Philosophy
Ernst Abbe wrote into the foundation guidelines a variety of social reforms, including:
*   Health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>
*   Pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>
*   Profit sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>
*   Equality in hiring decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>
*   Overtime pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>
*   Nine-hour work days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>

The foundation operates without owners or shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Abbe's intention was not to create a nonprofit, but to guarantee the company's continued existence after his death and ensure its employees could partake in its economic success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. The company was mandated to optimize for long-term economic success, with any excess profit invested back into the working population of the city of Jena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This structure makes it more akin to a cooperative than a charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

### Resistance to Nazi Influence
In the 1930s, the Nazi party attempted to place a representative inside the foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. However, the foundation resisted, eventually reaching a compromise where the board members became nominal members of the Nazi party in exchange for the foundation's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

## Modern Day Impact
Today, the Carl Zeiss Group's unique ownership structure ties it to its community in a way that is not commonly seen in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. The company continues to be a critical strategic partner in German industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>.

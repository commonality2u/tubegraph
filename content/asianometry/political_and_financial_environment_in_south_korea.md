From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

South Korea's rapid economic growth was heavily influenced by the interplay between its political leadership and powerful business conglomerates, known as [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | chaebol]]. This relationship, while initially fostering immense growth, also led to significant vulnerabilities and instances of [[corruption_and_political_ties_in_south_korea | corruption]].

## Early Development and Government-Business Ties

During the administration of President Park Chung-hee, the political and financial environment was characterized by a close symbiotic relationship between the government and large businesses. Companies like Daewoo Group, at its peak, benefited from a favorable political environment and significant access to debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Favorable Conditions for Growth
*   **Personal Ties and Influence** Kim Woo-jung, Daewoo's founder, benefited from personal ties to President Park Chung-hee, as Kim's father had been Park's primary school principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Strategic Hires** Daewoo regularly hired government elites and retired state bankers as executives, further cementing its connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Preferential Loans** These close ties enabled Daewoo to secure "absurdly favorable loans" at 6-9% interest, at a time when annual inflation reached 40% and private banks charged significantly higher rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Government Guidance** President Park Chung-hee's administration focused on building exports and capacity in strategic industries, providing favorable loans and funding to companies that followed this lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Reciprocity and [[corruption_and_political_ties_in_south_korea | Corruption]]
In return for preferential loans, monopoly protections, favorable labor laws, and silent backing, the [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | chaebol]] contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to the presidency's slush funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This close relationship was largely hidden from public view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Government's Role in Public Ownership
In the 1970s, the South Korean government mandated that [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | chaebol]] take their holding companies public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This was intended to inject liquidity into the Korean stock markets and allow the public to share in economic prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. While the [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | chaebol]] initially resisted, relying on bank funding, they complied after the government protected family control through shareholder rights adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This led to complex cross-ownership structures that maintained family control despite diluted economic shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Shifting Landscape and Challenges (Post-1979)

The assassination of President Park Chung-hee in 1979 marked a significant shift in the country's regulatory and economic climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Although Daewoo maintained some political ties, the environment changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

### Market Liberalization and Drying Loans
Succeeding governments began opening South Korea's markets to foreign competition, and the era of readily available cheap loans began to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This presented new challenges for [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | chaebol]] like Daewoo, whose business model relied on low prices and low quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### The Moral Hazard of Bailouts
The close ties led to an expectation of government bailouts, creating a moral hazard where companies would take excessive risks assuming they would not bear all the consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

For instance, in 1988, Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery faced near bankruptcy with $1.8 billion in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Daewoo expected a bailout, arguing it had taken on the shipyard at Park Chung-hee's request and that the Korea Development Bank had not fulfilled a promised equity injection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Even shipyard employees expected a bailout and negotiated significant wage increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The government ultimately bailed out Daewoo Shipbuilding in 1989 with 200 billion Korean Won in preferential loans and an additional 50 billion Won injection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. This reaffirmed the perception of Daewoo's closeness to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and Its Aftermath

The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 had a devastating impact on South Korea's financial landscape. The Korean Won plunged in value, leading to a controversial bailout from international entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. The economy shrank by nearly seven percent the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

Despite other [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | chaebol]] pulling back, Daewoo continued its reckless expansion, accumulating more debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Investors continued to believe a government bailout was inevitable, and Daewoo was in discussions with the government from June 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. However, the government demanded austerity measures that Daewoo's chairman, Kim Woo-jung, resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

### Government Intervention and Collapse
In late 1998, the Korean government recognized the financial contagion risk of a Daewoo debt default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. They restricted financial institutions from holding more than five percent of their portfolios in Daewoo Group debt, effectively cutting off Daewoo's credit lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. This marked a significant shift in government policy towards [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | chaebol]], moving away from automatic bailouts.

Despite a public agreement in December 1998 for Daewoo to downsize and reduce its debt ratio, these "restructuring" efforts lacked enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Rumors of last-minute deals and special relationships with the incoming president, Kim Dae-jung, kept false hope alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

## Financial Misconduct and [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | Reforms]]
Daewoo's financial state was far worse than publicly known. The company was already bankrupt at the end of 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Reported profits were generated through fictitious overseas asset sales and fraudulent practices between subsidiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. This amounted to an estimated 23 trillion Won (about $19 billion), making it Korea's largest accounting fraud at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

In August 1999, Daewoo's chairman was removed, and subsidiaries were placed into bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. The collapse led to banks and insurance companies losing trillions of Won, requiring the Korean government to inject public money to prevent their collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

### Post-Collapse [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | Reforms]]
The Daewoo saga triggered extensive [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | reforms]] and increased investor transparency and banking oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. It also led to [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | reforms]] in the Korean accounting industry, as accountants who overlooked the fraud faced fines and license suspensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.

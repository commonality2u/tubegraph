Semiconductor manufacturing is an industry with significant water demands, posing challenges in regions already facing water scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This article explores the economic implications of these facilities, particularly their impact on local water resources and the decisions made by governments to support their operations.

## High Water Demand in Semiconductor Manufacturing

Semiconductor manufacturing, especially wafer fabrication, is highly water-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Wafer Cleaning**: Thirty to forty percent of steps in modern wafer fabrication involve some form of wafer cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Sequential wash steps remove organics, metals, and particles, with water rinsing off chemicals between each step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Ultra Pure Water (UPW)**: Standard tap water cannot be used due to potential damage to wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Facilities require "ultra pure water," a real industry term, with cleanliness standards stricter than almost any other industry, targeting "killer particles" like microorganism waste, organic particles, dissolved metals, and gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Generating UPW is a complex, multi-step process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   It takes approximately 6,000 liters (1,600 gallons) of city water to produce 3,800 liters (1,000 gallons) of UPW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
    *   A single 200mm (8-inch) wafer can consume over 5,600 liters (2,000 gallons) of UPW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Circuit Complexity**: Logic circuits (like microprocessors) have more layers and are more complex than memory ICs or display panels, requiring more water and energy for their manufacture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Advanced Nodes**: More advanced process nodes require increased process cleanliness and thus more water, more UPW, and more stringent UPW standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Cutting-edge chips today use more water to fab than those ten years prior, despite advancements in water reuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This trend is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Wastewater Management and Recycling

Semiconductor processes generate substantial amounts of wastewater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Pollutants**: This wastewater contains high levels of pollutants like ammonia, phosphate, and fluoride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Treatment Complexity**: Different types of wastewater require varied, often expensive and extensive, treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Large foundries separate wastewater streams and apply specific treatments for over 25 chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Reuse and Evaporation**: Some treated water is reusable for generating more UPW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Non-reusable water is often sent to cooling towers and evaporated to help maintain fab temperatures, which is the single biggest use of a facility's energy and water after direct manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness**: For smaller companies, it's often more cost-effective to broadly treat wastewater and return it to the city, then get new raw water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. However, large fabs like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel *must* implement water reuse and recycling technologies due to their scale; without them, they would quickly run out of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   TSMC's recycle rate in 2017 was 87% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   The average semiconductor fab, however, recycled less than half that, at 42% in a 2017 study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## Regional Water Challenges
[[semiconductor_industry_water_usage]] is a critical issue, particularly in regions prone to [[water_shortages_and_droughts_impact_on_semiconductor_manufacturing]].

### Taiwan
Taiwan has experienced severe droughts, particularly in the south (Tainan, Kaohsiung, Hsinchu) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. TSMC has reportedly budgeted millions of dollars to truck water to its fabs in Tainan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   In 2019, TSMC fabs in Tainan alone consumed 50,000 metric tons (50 million liters) of water daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   The area draws from the Nanhua and Zhengwen reservoirs, which have faced dangerously low capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   Taiwan's south is also its agricultural heart, competing for water resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   TSMC has implemented water recycling, built large rain collection systems (storing water in 700-ton tanks), and signed tenders for water reclamation plants near its fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. These plants use advanced procedures like reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration, similar to Singapore's "Newater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Arizona
Despite being largely a desert, Arizona is a location where TSMC and Intel are building fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   Forty percent of Arizona's total water demand is met by non-renewable groundwater, and 57% by the Colorado River and other surface water sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Shortfalls from surface water are met by groundwater, which is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   The state government manages water usage by transferring water from farms to cities, as agriculture consumes nearly 90% of total water demand in the American Southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Converting farmland to cities and suburbs has helped curb overall water usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   However, a coordinated plan for water management has not fully succeeded, and groundwater pumping remains a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## Economic Justification for Fabs in Water-Stressed Areas
[[the_economics_and_costs_of_building_semiconductor_fabs]] and the pursuit of [[government_subsidies_and_their_effects_on_the_semiconductor_industry]] play a significant role in locating fabs in water-stressed regions.

### Profitability and High Value-Add
High-volume semiconductor manufacturing is a highly profitable and high value-add industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Willingness to Invest**: States are willing to incur the costs of providing water infrastructure or reallocating water from other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Economic Benefits Outweigh Costs**: A 2012 paper comparing land usages in Chandler, Arizona (where fabs are built), found that the economic benefits from semiconductor manufacturing outweighed the costs of providing water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Government Revenue**: Governments receive significantly more revenue on a per-acre basis from semiconductor manufacturing than from other land uses, largely through property taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This incentivizes them to attract these facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Job Creation**: While the industry brings high-paying jobs, it may bring fewer per-acre compared to other land uses due to high automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

### Investment in Water Technologies
The wealth of the semiconductor industry allows it to invest heavily in [[wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | water-saving, reusing, and recycling techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This means a high percentage of water is theoretically returned to the wastewater system, far higher than with other land usages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### Trade-offs and Political Consequences
For foundries, other advantages of locations like Arizona—such as a ready supply of educated talent, tax incentives, and seismic stability—outweigh the simple lack of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   Because high-value semiconductor manufacturing is so profitable, governments are more likely to find water for it by reallocating it from other shares, typically agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. This has occurred in both Taiwan and Arizona, where farmers have seen their water allocations cut and diverted to tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   While agriculture is the primary water user globally, and arguments exist regarding its economic efficiency in water usage, diverting water from farmers carries significant political consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Governments must delicately balance these economic incentives with political realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The semiconductor industry's demand for water will persist as Moore's Law continues to drive advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Ongoing innovation in water recycling, reduction, and reuse technologies is crucial to ensure sufficient water resources for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

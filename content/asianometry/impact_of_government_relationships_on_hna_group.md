From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

[[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | China's HNA Group]], at its peak, presided over an estimated $170 billion of assets globally, including stakes in Deutsche Bank and Hilton Hotels, ownership of airports and real estate, and the world's third-largest aircraft leasing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The conglomerate acquired most of these assets in just a few years, often conducting multi-million or billion-dollar transactions monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The rapid rise and subsequent [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | implosion]] of [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]] is inextricably linked to its complex and evolving relationship with the Chinese government.

## Early Government Support and Deregulation
In 1988, the central Chinese government designated Hainan as a special economic zone to attract investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. That same year, the government began deregulating its airline industry, restructuring its national airline monopoly into six individual airlines and allowing private-public partnerships for regional carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The Hainan government contributed 10 million RMB ($1.4 million) as startup capital for Hainan Provincial Airlines, which initially made no progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Ties to Officials and Opaque Ownership
Tan Feng, a key figure in [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]]'s founding, was the son of Communist Party officials and served in the People's Liberation Army Air Force and China's civil aviation regulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. He met co-founder Wang Jian at the civil aviation regulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. While Tan was at the agricultural Investment Trust of China, Wang Qishan, a powerful anti-corruption czar and Xi Jinping ally, served as its chief executive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Rumors of a deeper connection between Tan and Wang Qishan existed, though without solid evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

The company's ownership structure became famously complicated and opaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. From 2002 to 2015, [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]]'s controlling shareholder was a Hainan Airlines Trade Union, later replaced by the Hainan Cihang Charity Foundation, a non-profit founded by HNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This foundation, despite supporting anti-poverty efforts, seemed to primarily serve as a vehicle for Tan's control, employing company friends and family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Government Interventions and Stimulus
[[financial_challenges_and_debt_management_at_hna_group | HNA Group]] faced significant financial challenges, particularly during crises:
*   **SARS Epidemic (2003)**: The company incurred a massive loss of 1.5 billion RMB and came close to [[hna_groups_bankruptcy_and_asset_liquidation | bankruptcy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. The Hainan provincial government, despite its relatively small financial stake, bailed out the company with an injection of 1.5 billion RMB in 2005, representing 10% of its entire revenue that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Global Financial Crisis (2008)**: [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]] again suffered a 1.73 billion RMB loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. The Hainan provincial government injected another 1.5 billion RMB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Additionally, the Chinese government's 4 trillion RMB stimulus package in November 2008 caused land prices to skyrocket, benefiting [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]]'s land holdings in Haikou <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

## Partnerships with Local Governments
[[hna_groups_acquisition_strategy_and_its_consequences | HNA Group]] strategically partnered with provincial and city governments on infrastructure projects across China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. By leasing assets to these governments, [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]] helped them bypass their debt limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. These land development projects were then spun off into publicly traded subsidiaries, whose skyrocketing stock prices allowed [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]]'s management to pledge shares for even more loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

## Regulatory Scrutiny and Crackdown
The turning point came in mid-May 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. On June 22, 2017, the China Banking Regulatory Commission ordered banks to conduct risk checks on the overseas borrowing and investing of [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]] and other conglomerates like Anbang and Dalian Wanda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. This signaled a shift in [[regulatory_and_government_interactions_with_evergrande | government policy]].
*   Major international banks like Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs stopped accepting [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]] shares as pledges for new loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority requested information on [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]]'s financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   In November 2017, the Chinese central government criticized [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]]'s Sanya New Airport Reclamation project for "suspected illegal use of the sea," shaking confidence in the company's "vaunted [[political_influence_and_government_ties | government connections]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. This led to a rush by credit rating agencies to downgrade [[financial_challenges_and_debt_management_at_hna_group | HNA Group]]'s debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.

## Consequences and [[hna_groups_bankruptcy_and_asset_liquidation | Bankruptcy]]
The loss of implicit [[political_influence_and_government_ties | government backing]] and the regulatory crackdown forced [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]] to reverse its aggressive expansion. In January 2018, [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]] management announced plans to unwind its build-up, sell 100 billion RMB of assets, and return to its core airline business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. A third of [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]]'s publicly traded affiliates had their shares suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>.

Ultimately, on February 2021, [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]] entered [[hna_groups_bankruptcy_and_asset_liquidation | bankruptcy proceedings]] with $170 billion of acknowledged debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. In September 2021, co-founder Tan Feng and chief executive Adam Tan were detained by the Chinese government for suspected crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.

## The Unspoken Question: [[political_influence_and_government_ties | Government Involvement]]
For years, a "notion floated around that [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]] can only have gotten so far, borrowed so much, and bought so much because it had the backing of or was even a vehicle for the Chinese government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. This perception caused anxiety in the West regarding its true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. While some claims of [[political_influence_and_government_ties | government approval]] existed, an equally strong argument suggests the company's complex structure was designed to "dodge oversight" until it could no longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. The enterprise was held together by mountains of debt and the "unspoken implication of close [[political_influence_and_government_ties | government involvement]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

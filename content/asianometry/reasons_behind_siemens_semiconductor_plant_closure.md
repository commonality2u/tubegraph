In 1995, Siemens Semiconductor pledged over a billion pounds to build a semiconductor fabrication plant ("fab") in North Tyneside, Northeast England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Despite initial fanfare, including a visit from the Queen, the plant operated for only 15 months before Siemens closed it in July 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. An attempt to revive the plant by Atmel also failed years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

## Northeast England's Economic Context

Northeast England, once a heavy industry powerhouse, struggled economically after the decline of those industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. As of 2012, it had the lowest median gross annual earnings and the highest proportion of the population claiming income support in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The region has faced a significant employment gap with the rest of the UK since at least the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. In 1995, its unemployment rate was 9.1%, 50% higher than the UK average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The region's long-standing dependence on heavy industry and coal mines, coupled with post-WWII government policies that discouraged new male-employing manufacturing, left it vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. De-industrialization in the 1980s, exemplified by the 1984-1985 miners' strike, devastated the region, leading to thousands of job losses as imported coal became cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. By the 1990s, Northeast England felt marginalized within the global economy and neglected by London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This context made the prospect of a major semiconductor manufacturing facility highly appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Siemens' Strategic Shift and Semiconductor Ambition

Siemens, a German company founded in 1847, traditionally held a comfortable, profitable, and government-supported position within Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. For instance, the Bundespost (German state postal and telecommunications service) prioritized German-produced equipment, largely benefiting Siemens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. However, by the 1980s, deregulation in the US and UK pushed Siemens to become more competitive, international, and market-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

The global semiconductor industry was booming in the mid-1990s, driven by products like Windows 95 and mobile phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. The industry grew 29% in 1993, 32% in 1994, and 42% in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Siemens Semiconductors, traditionally an in-house chip producer, began competing for its own customers in the 1990s, focusing on niche markets like ASICs for telecommunications, mobile phones, and automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Sales grew 40% annually in the early 1990s, and by 1994, Siemens was the 12th largest semiconductor maker globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

To seize further opportunities, particularly internationally, Siemens Semiconductor set an internal plan in 1994 to triple chip sales and enter the industry's top 10 rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This involved establishing semiconductor operations outside Germany, including new fabrication plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## The North Tyneside Investment

In 1995, Siemens approached the Invest in Britain Bureau about building a wafer fabrication facility in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The proposed fab would be an exact copy of their successful 16-megabyte DRAM facility in Dresden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. It was projected to cost 1.1 billion British pounds (785 million USD) and create 2,000 new jobs, making it the UK's biggest-ever inward investment at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Other locations considered included Ireland, Austria, Israel, Singapore, and Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

North Tyneside checked all of Siemens' criteria:
*   **Skilled workforce:** Local technician-level people willing to work shifts, and educated electronics/computing graduates from local universities or nearby Scotland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Lower salaries:** Salaries were 50% lower than in Austria or Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure:** The government offered a direct connection to the national electricity grid, a first for a private company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Government support:** The UK provided Â£64 million (45 million USD) in public support, including tax exemptions, grants, and job training subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. While Ireland and Austria offered more, the UK package was considered a legitimate investment to attract a globally famous company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

The UK government saw the investment as a chance to establish the area as a semiconductor destination, attract suppliers, and transfer technology and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. It also offered the opportunity to replace semiconductor imports from Europe, a significant trade impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Siemens also wanted to commit to the UK market, where its revenue grew 25% annually from 1985 to 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

Construction began quickly, even before land ownership was finalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Siemens completed the fab in just 376 days, with production starting in May 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The first phase produced 16-megabyte DRAM units using a 0.35 micron process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. A second phase, intended for more advanced 64-megabyte memory units, was planned but later delayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Reasons for the Closure

The closure of the North Tyneside fab was due to a combination of factors, primarily market volatility and strategic missteps by Siemens:

### 1. Immensely Volatile DRAM Market
The DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) market is notoriously volatile and prone to oversupply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. These memory chips are a commodity product that competes heavily on price, with little differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Leading-edge technical mastery and market position are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### 2. Outdated Technology
Siemens' decision to equip the North Tyneside fab with older 16-megabyte DRAM technology was perilous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. This technology was already becoming outdated by 1995, as Siemens' German plants were moving to 64-megabyte production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. The cheaper location was intended to maintain profitability for these older modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Had there been a choice, pushing for leading-edge 64-megabyte DRAM or logic chips would have been more sensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

### 3. Semiconductor Market Crash of 1998
The semiconductor market crashed in 1998, with memory prices plummeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The price per megabyte fell from $27 to just $4 by the time the Tyneside plant opened in 1997, and then further to $2 per megabyte by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Chips that sold for $50 in 1995 were selling for $1 in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. South Korean giants, grappling with the Asian financial crisis, flooded the market with memory wafers to stay afloat, exacerbating oversupply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

### 4. Siemens' Financial Losses
Industry-wide profits collapsed. Siemens Semiconductor, which made a $65 million profit in the year ending September 1997, suffered a stunning loss of $722 million by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. This appalling loss prompted a need for drastic cost-cutting measures, leading to the decision to close the UK plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

### 5. Lack of Scale and Internal Backing
The North Tyneside fab lacked scale, having only a third of the capacity of Siemens' Dresden plants and not being fully built out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Crucially, it also lacked significant internal or external backers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Siemens was unlikely to close its German or Austrian plants, and its facilities in the US, France, and Taiwan were joint ventures, making them harder to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. The pro-British management who initially championed the plant lost their jobs, and the new Siemens Semiconductor CEO was strongly pro-Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

## Aftermath and Legacy

The closure was costly, estimated at nearly a quarter-billion dollars, and Siemens had to repay some government grant money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. In August 1999, Siemens Semiconductor was spun off into a new company, Infineon Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

In September 2000, semiconductor firm Atmel purchased the facility for Â£25 million (35 million USD), intending to invest Â£700 million to retool it for flash memory and microcontroller circuits â more stable markets than DRAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. However, the dot-com crash in 2001 led to Atmel suffering significant losses and laying off a large portion of its workforce, interrupting its investment plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Atmel eventually sold the equipment to TSMC in 2007 and the empty buildings were sold off, marking the final end of the semiconductor dream in North Tyneside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

Today, the fab facility has been repurposed as the Cobalt Business Park, housing government offices, call centers, and regional offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. The closure of the Siemens plant was not isolated; 1998 also saw the loss of 3,400 manufacturing jobs in Northeast England, including the closure of Electrolux and Pringle factories, and later the Fujitsu fab that opened in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

The local economy's challenge remains its reliance on foreign companies with little attachment to the region, leading them to favor their homelands during financial crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. While North Tyneside and Northeast England have yet to regain past industrial glory, there are "green shoots" in the renewable energy sector, with a growing wind industry, including the prospective Darker Bank wind farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

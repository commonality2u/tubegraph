From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

South Korea's economic strength, largely attributed to massive business groups like Samsung, Hyundai, and LG, is also a source of its significant economic weaknesses, including widespread social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These groups, while powering the export economy and dominating daily life, have historically manipulated the Korean economy to their advantage, maintaining [[Corruption and Political Ties in South Korea | corrupt ties]] with the highest levels of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Historical Roots of Inequality and Corruption

The roots of [[Corruption and Political Ties in South Korea | corruption]] and economic inequality in Korea predate the modern state, stemming from the Japanese colonial administration, which featured a corrupt and unequal agricultural economy where landlords exploited farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Many of these legacies persisted into the new South Korean government after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Formation of the Chaebol

South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee, established the [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] (large family-controlled business conglomerates) to raise funds for the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. From 1946 to the 1950s, his government privatized assets seized from the Japanese state and other state-owned entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. These privatizations were determined by private negotiation rather than public auction, allowing a few purchasers to acquire valuable companies cheaply, eventually becoming the [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### The Era of Crony Capitalism

In 1961, Park Chung-hee led a military coup and initially arrested [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] heads for corrupt wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. However, his government quickly negotiated a "crony capitalism" deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. In exchange for [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] support for Park's industrialization policies (import substitution and exports), the government provided foreign currency loans at below-market interest rates, enabling them to acquire foreign technologies and build capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] also contributed funds for Park's presidential campaigns through kickbacks, such as 10-15% loan commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This created a system where befriending the president was the best way to acquire cheap capital and wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

Over the next 20 years, the government and [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] jointly ran Korean society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Companies funded political campaigns and helped grow the economy, while the government granted privileges and imposed the costs of [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] excesses on society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For example, in 1971, the government bailed out over-leveraged [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] by converting private market loans to public ones and freezing private interest rates, harming small lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Growing Dominance of Big Business

By the mid-1980s, the balance of power shifted decisively in the [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]]'s favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The top five [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] accounted for nearly 20% of the country's GDP and 45% of its mining/manufacturing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]]-centric strategy stifled South Korea's small and medium-sized business sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. From 1966 to 1976, manufacturing firms grew only 10% in number but 176% in size, unlike Taiwan, which saw significant growth in firm numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Democratization and Deepening Inequality

As South Korea democratized, the public became increasingly disapproving of the [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]]'s outsized power and demanded better environmental regulations, working conditions, and quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Despite the shift towards democracy, government leaders continued to rely on [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] financial contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. During Chun Doo-hwan's administration, [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] contributed 15-22 billion won to high-level political campaigns, and 21-25 billion won during Roh Tae-woo's administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This persistent [[Corruption and Political Ties in South Korea | corruption]] was partly due to the weakness of South Korea's political parties, which lacked strong financing systems after years of military dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This vulnerability allowed [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] to continue receiving government aid, favorable regulations, and protection from competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

After democratization in 1987, the [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] gained substantial political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. For instance, the [[history_and_rise_of_daewoo_group | Daewoo Group]] successfully lobbied the National Assembly to amend laws, allowing the government to bail out its ailing shipbuilding corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. They also pushed for rapid liberalization reforms, such as easier access to foreign capital (leading to a massive debt boom) and limited ownership stakes in non-bank financial companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. The latter encouraged complex cross-ownership structures that obscured the true size and financial health of these conglomerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This meant profitable companies propped up weak ones, leading to market inefficiencies and oversupply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Asian Financial Crisis and Subsequent Reforms

The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 exposed the consequences of Korea's inability to rein in its big businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This crisis opened the door for [[Reforms and Challenges in South Koreas Economic Landscape | reforms]] aimed at preventing future financial crises by limiting debt capacity and cross-shareholder structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Administrations under Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun imposed various [[Reforms in South Korean business practices | reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. For example, Hanjin Shipping was forced to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio, leading it to sell ships and lease others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The Korean car industry consolidated from five independent companies to just Hyundai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | Chaebol]] also reduced their affiliates and increased dividends to minority shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

### The Export Juggernaut and Widening Inequality

The crisis also spurred the creation of the Korean export juggernaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Recognizing an "unfriendly domestic environment," the largest [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] leveraged free trade agreements in the 2000s and turned outwards, becoming wildly successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. By 2013, 86% of Samsung's revenue came from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. This success drove South Korea's economic recovery, with an average GDP growth of 5% from 1998 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

However, this growth masked significant social issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. The benefits of growth primarily accrued to a small cohort of people, creating a significant gap between the "haves" and "have-nots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. In 2013, [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] accounted for over 50% of revenue and value-add in manufacturing but employed less than 20% of the sector's employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. A key agreement during the post-1997 [[Reforms in South Korean business practices | reform]] era allowed [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] to become more profitable by making it easier for them to lay off employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This led to hundreds of thousands losing their jobs, many of whom never found regular salaried work again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Elder poverty in South Korea reached four times the OECD average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, and the income share for the top 1% rose from 7% before 1997 to 12% by the mid-2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Political Responses to Inequality

The public's recognition of this growing inequality influenced political outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

### Lee Myung-bak's Administration (2007)

President Lee Myung-bak, a former businessman and CEO of Hyundai Construction, won the 2007 election by emphasizing economic recovery after what he called a "lost decade" of liberal rule, despite the economy growing at 5% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. His "747 promise" aimed for 7% GDP growth, $40,000 per capita income, and South Korea becoming the seventh-largest economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Lee's policies favored big business, including lowering the corporate tax rate, raising ceilings on non-bank financial investment, and amnestying executives convicted after the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. He sought to return to an era of rapid economic growth but failed to deliver the promised growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Lee was later arrested for bribery, embezzlement, and tax fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### Park Geun-hye's Administration (2012)

In 2012, Park Geun-hye campaigned with a platform combining nostalgia for past economic glory with a stronger emphasis on welfare, though notably without advocating for a higher capital gains tax, a key factor in the wealth gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Her administration ultimately ended in [[Corruption and Political Ties in South Korea | corruption scandals]] and impeachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

## Consequences of Big Business Corruption and Influence

Modern [[Corruption and Political Ties in South Korea | corruption]] by [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] aims to maximize wealth and market power through tax manipulations and regulatory capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. The tragic consequences of such actions were highlighted by the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking, which claimed 304 lives, mostly high school students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The high death rate was primarily due to safety and rescue regulations being ignored, a result of the close working relationship between the regulatory agency and the ferry company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. This cozy arrangement included the rotation of government employees into the industry and the ferry company's monopoly privilege on a lucrative route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

President Moon Jae-in, Park Geun-hye's successor, responded with certain [[Reforms in South Korean business practices | business reforms]] and higher tax rates, leading to some improvement in public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. However, the South Korean economy remains highly dependent on its powerful global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Substantial [[Reforms in South Korean business practices | reform]] could potentially weaken their global competitive position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. The issue of [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] [[Reforms in South Korean business practices | reform]] and addressing social inequality remains a central and furiously debated topic in [[Political and financial environment in South Korea | South Korean presidential politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

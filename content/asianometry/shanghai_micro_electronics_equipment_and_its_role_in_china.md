Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) is China's ambitious project to replace ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The company has garnered significant attention and cheerleading in Chinese media, particularly due to recent high-profile export bans to China, which have brought it into special focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Historical Context of Chinese Lithography

China's first lithography machine, the GK3, was created in 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Two years later, it evolved into the JKG3, the first domestically created lithography machine for large-scale commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The GK4 prototype, a contact lithography machine, followed in 1978, capable of printing chips on 75-millimeter wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Contact lithography, where the photomask is in direct contact with a photoresist-coated substrate, is known for high defect rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The U.S. invented and commercialized this technology in the 1950s, placing China two decades behind at this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Subsequent stages in the commercial tech tree included the proximity aligner, which introduces a gap between the mask and substrate, and the step-and-scan device (stepper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. China attempted to develop both simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. In 1981, the Institute of Semiconductors of the Chinese Academy of Sciences successfully developed two proximity aligner prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. By 1985, after six years of work, the 45th Institute of the Ministry of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering developed its own stepper, "inspired" by the U.S.-based GCA 4800 DSW, which printed designs using the 436-nanometer g-line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

By 2000, China began research on machines utilizing argon fluoride lasers on the 193-nanometer wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. However, the West started shipping such devices in 1990, indicating a persistent technology gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This led the government to consider a change in direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Founding and Mission

SMEE was founded in March 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. China's 12th five-year plan (2011-2015) included 16 major national special projects, with lithography ranked second highest, known as the "Zero Two Special Project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

The project had multiple goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>:
*   Develop manufacturing equipment capable of producing 22 to 45-nanometer processed chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   Conduct forward research on 14 to 22-nanometer processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   Work on 65 to 90-nanometer special processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Capture at least 10% of the domestic lithography market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   Attempt to enter the international market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

SMEE was designated the country's "national champion" to achieve these goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Early Development and Strategy

SMEE's first office was located in the Shanghai Zhangjiang High-Tech Park in the Pudong district, with semiconductor-related neighbors like [[huawei_and_smics_semiconductor_collaboration | SMIC]], Gray Semiconductor, and Spreadtrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The founding general manager and chairman, Ha Rong Ming, was known for his dedication, working long hours for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

Over two decades, SMEE developed its products through extensive R&D, filing over 3,000 patents by 2019, with 1,600 granted, including nearly 700 in foreign countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The company has received extensive support from both local and central Chinese governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The Shanghai SASAC, overseeing the city's corporate assets, is SMEE's single biggest owner with 32% of the shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Facing import restrictions, such as on high-level optics from Carl Zeiss of Germany, SMEE targeted a less competitive segment of the lithography market: advanced packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This strategy aimed for the company to gain experience in back-end lithography before moving to front-end lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Market Performance and Expansion

SMEE's strategy has shown traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Its products hold 80% of the domestic market in back-end lithography, corresponding to 40% of the global market in 2019, with over 50 units shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Major back-end customers include Changjiang Electric Group, Taiwan-based ASE Group, and Tongfu Microelectronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

The company has since expanded into lithography tools for other niche semiconductor products: power devices, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and LEDs, with LEDs being the most promising market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. SMEE also began developing for the front-end, intending to sell to companies like Yangtze Memory and [[huawei_and_smics_semiconductor_collaboration | SMIC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## Technology and Supply Chain Challenges

Unlike its Japanese competitors, Canon and Nikon, SMEE is built on the ASML model, aiming to be the final system integrator for lithography tools, working with various suppliers for different parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

The core factors for a lithography machine's success include high-precision optics, the light source, high-precision mechanics, and software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. ASML relies on companies like Cymer for light sources and a joint venture with Carl Zeiss for optics, often holding significant equity or outright ownership in these critical suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

For SMEE, its "Carl Zeiss" is identified as Changchun Up Optotech and Beijing Guowang Technology Company, though Changchun is no longer associated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Beijing Guowang is building an optics manufacturing factory, but mass supply of immersion-ready optical systems isn't expected until its completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. SMEE's equivalent to Cymer is Beijing RS Laser Opto Electronics Technology, whose product is underpowered compared to ASML's immersion systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

A significant challenge for SMEE is the requirement for domestic suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. A number of core technologies still need to be imported or purchased from foreign companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. For example, the vast majority of photomasks are made by Japanese companies Toppan Printing and Dai Nippon Printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Although Jiangsu Nata Opto-electronic Material Company has created a photomask that works in an ASML immersion system, other critical components like ball bearings from Sweden, valves from France, and grating alignment systems from the United States are not made in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Without these, it is difficult to ship a commercial-grade, working machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Current Product Capabilities

As of August 2021, SMEE systems are for 90-nanometer, 110-nanometer, and 280-nanometer processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. These are specialized systems for back-end lithography, LEDs, MEMS, and power devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Lithography systems are grouped by their laser light source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>:
*   I-line machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
*   Krypton fluoride laser machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>
*   Argon fluoride laser machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
*   Argon fluoride immersion laser machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
*   EUV machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>

The majority of SMEE systems use I-line and krypton fluoride lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Their most advanced system, the SSA/600-20 scanner for front-end manufacturing at the 90-nanometer node, uses an argon fluoride (ArF) laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. A prototype of this product, the 600-10, profiled in 2011, had a field size of 22x32 millimeters and could process about 50 wafers an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Comparable Canon and Nikon machines can process up to five times that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. As of 2019, the 600-20 iteration was not selling in relevant quantities, and SMEE's recent sales are still in outdated I-line lithography machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

SMEE's future pipeline includes an argon fluoride immersion (ArF-e) system, said to be capable of the 28-nanometer process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This 28-nanometer tool is currently a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## Challenges in Commercialization

China has historically been good at building prototypes, typically lagging the leading edge by about 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. The 28-nanometer node, a half-step after 32-nanometer, began shipping around 2011, fitting this pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. However, the issue is transitioning from prototype to high-volume commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>; China has not been able to turn its prototypes into commercially competitive products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

The goal was to deliver commercial-ready 28-nanometer ArF-e machines in 2021 or 2022, leading to headlines claiming China would have such machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This deadline is likely to be missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, as Beijing Guowang, a critical optics supplier, is working on a foundry not expected to be completed until September 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Considering integration lag, a 2024 ship date might be ambitious, and even then, the product is not expected to be commercially competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

Chinese news sources tend to exaggerate headlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. For example, in November 2018, the Institute of Opto-Electronics Technology announced a 22-nanometer "super-resolution" lithography tool, with CCTV claiming multi-patterning could achieve sub-10-nanometer levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. However, the tool was not commercially ready, had low accuracy, and a field of view of only a few square millimeters, making it extremely slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. By contrast, ASML's Twinscan NXT 1970Ci, a comparable DUV machine, offers a field of view of 858 square millimeters and can do over 250 wafers an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

## Human Capital and Working Culture

A significant difference exists in human capital management between SMEE and ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. For Chinese entry-level college graduates, salaries are around $45,000 USD annually, with PhDs making about twice as much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. SMEE's average PhD salary is similar to ASML's company-wide average salary, but ASML's higher-end staff software engineers can make nearly $200,000 USD annually, indicating a significant pay gap even considering cost of living differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

ASML offers generous benefits such as share purchase plans, pension plans, commuting allowances, 40 days of paid leave, and holiday allowances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. SMEE, lacking ASML's capital base (Europe's most valuable tech company at $300 billion), will find it challenging to offer comparable benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

As one of China's national champions, SMEE bears expectations similar to other major tech companies like [[huawei_and_smics_semiconductor_collaboration | Huawei]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. It has adopted [[huawei_and_smics_semiconductor_collaboration | Huawei]]'s working practices, which include long hours, considerable political intervention, tough annual assessments for bonuses, and a Jack Welch-style 5-10% layoff each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This approach may hinder SMEE's ability to acquire and retain top talent, as human capital is vital in the semiconductor manufacturing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

## Overall Outlook and Future

SMEE's efforts receive extensive coverage in the Chinese press, with the photolithography effort often termed the "Mount Everest of the intelligent manufacturing industry," accompanied by much cheerleading and optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Despite strong rhetoric, the reality is that SMEE is at least 20 years behind ASML in bringing a commercial-ready upper-class lithography device to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Immersion lithography is nascent for SMEE, and EUV is even farther away, a reality even Chinese sources acknowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

Such exaggerated claims are counterproductive, leading to pessimism when deadlines are missed and preventing a focus on actual problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. However, it's not to say that China's semiconductor production equipment ecosystem is without progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. The progress in back-end lithography and LED lithography is encouraging, especially as China gains market share in the display industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Some Chinese companies have built strong track records in specific semiconductor equipment areas, with one even acquiring TSMC as a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. This highlights [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | challenges and advancements in Chinese semiconductor industry]] and [[developments_in_chinas_domestic_semiconductor_ecosystem | developments in China's domestic semiconductor ecosystem]].

SMEE is reportedly considering an IPO in the future, with valuations estimated between $5 to $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. An IPO would release new information in a prospectus, potentially offering an updated outlook on the company's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

In 1995, Siemens Semiconductor pledged over a billion pounds for a semiconductor fabrication plant in Northeast England, an area that had been struggling economically since the decline of its heavy industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Despite initial fanfare, including a visit from the Queen, the plant operated for only 15 months before Siemens closed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Northeast England's Economic Struggles

Northeast England, the least populated region within England with less than 2.7 million residents, historically depended on heavy industry and rich coal mines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. After World War II, the British government nationalized the coal and steel industries, with the Ministry of Fuel and Power advocating against new male-employing manufacturing industries to maximize output and employment in existing resource economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This policy made the region dangerously dependent on these two sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

When de-industrialization began in the 1980s, culminating in the 1984-1985 miners' strike, the region had few economic alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The strike's defeat led to mine closures due to depleted coal reserves and cheaper imported coal, resulting in thousands of job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

By the 1990s, Northeast England faced significant challenges:
*   Lowest median gross annual earnings in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   Highest proportion of population claiming income support as of 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   Employment gap with the rest of the UK since at least the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   Unemployment rate of 9.1% in 1995, 50% higher than the rest of the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   A perception of being neglected by London, especially compared to Scotland, which received substantially more public spending via the Barnett Formula, allowing it to offer more attractive investment packages to multinational companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Siemens' Global Semiconductor Ambitions

Siemens, an old German company founded in 1847, traditionally held a profitable position within Germany, supported by the German government for national and employment reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. For example, the Bundesbank (German state-run postal and telecommunications service) mandated orders to firms producing equipment in Germany, largely benefiting Siemens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

By the 1980s, the trend of deregulation in the US and UK forced Siemens to compete, leading management to pursue a more international, shareholder-friendly, and market-oriented strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The global semiconductor industry was booming, driven by releases like Windows 95 and the rise of mobile phones, leading to significant demand for computers and semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The industry grew 29% in 1993, 32% in 1994, and 42% in 1995, investing a staggering $30 billion in new chip fabrication facilities (fabs) in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

Siemens Semiconductors, traditionally an in-house producer, began competing for its own customers in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. They focused on niche markets aligned with other Siemens product lines, such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for telecommunications, mobile phones, and automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Their sales grew 40% annually in the early 1990s, driven by consumer electronics and telecom demand in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. By 1994, Siemens was the 12th largest semiconductor maker globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

To seize further international opportunity, Siemens Semiconductor aimed to triple chip sales and enter the industry's top 10 rankings, which included establishing semiconductor activities outside Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This involved plans for four new large-scale fabrication plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## The North Tyneside Bid

In 1995, Siemens approached the "Invest in Britain" bureau about building a wafer fabrication facility in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The proposed fab would be a copy of their successful 16-megabyte DRAM facility in Dresden, costing about 1.1 billion British pounds (785 million USD) and creating 2,000 new jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. It was slated to be the UK's biggest inward investment to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Other potential locations included Ireland, Austria, Israel, Singapore, and Vietnam, with Ireland and Austria being the main competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

Siemens' criteria for a location included skilled, low-cost labor, excellent water and power infrastructure, geological stability, and ample government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. North Tyneside in Northeast England met all requirements:
*   It had skilled technician-level people willing to work shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   Siemens could recruit educated electronics and computing graduates from local universities or nearby Scotland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   Salaries were 50% lower than in Austria or Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   The government offered a direct connection to the national grid, a first for a private company, to address electricity infrastructure concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

Local development agencies in Northeast England worked hard to secure the investment, offering hospitality, tours, university presentations, and significant government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Total UK public support for the project was reported at 64 million pounds (45 million USD) through tax exemptions, grants, and job training subsidies, though not all of it was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. While Ireland and Austria offered more lavish support (Austria offered 120 million pounds or 85 million USD), the UK's package was considered a good investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

The strategic reasons for attracting Siemens included:
*   Its globally famous name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   Further establishing the area as a semiconductor destination, building on Fujitsu's 1989 fab (which received a subsidy three times larger) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   Potentially kickstarting an entire industry and attracting suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   The UK government's interest in technology transfer, skills development, and replacing semiconductor imports from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
Siemens' commitment to the UK market was evident through 25% annual revenue growth from 1985 to 1995, its position as the UK's 13th largest R&D investor, and its employment of 10,000 workers across a dozen manufacturing sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

The announcement sparked immediate public interest, with local job centers receiving thousands of inquiries within hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Construction and Operation

Semiconductor fabs are built in phases to quickly start production and capitalize on favorable industry conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The North Tyneside fab had two announced phases:
*   **Phase one:** Completed in mid-1997, producing 16-megabyte DRAM memory units with a 0.35-micron process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Phase two:** Planned to produce more advanced 64-megabyte memory units using a 0.25-micron process, upgrading capacity to 20,000 wafer starts per month, and meeting the full 2,000 job requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

Construction was exceptionally fast, completed in just 376 days, with contractors starting before land ownership was finalized and using innovative steel frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Production began in May 1997, a year and a half after breaking ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Queen Elizabeth II toured the facility for its ribbon-cutting, stating it brought the country to the forefront of semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Failure and Aftermath

In 1997, Siemens delayed phase two of the Tyneside plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. In July 1998, they announced its complete closure by year-end, less than two years after opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

The closure was primarily due to:
*   **Volatile DRAM Market:** The DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) market is immensely volatile and prone to oversupply because these memory chips are a cheap, undifferentiated commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Siemens' decision to equip the fab with older 16-megabyte memory technology was perilous, as it was already going out of date by 1995, while German plants were producing 64-megabyte units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. The cheaper UK location was intended to keep older memory modules profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **1998 Semiconductor Market Crash:** The memory market crashed in 1998; the price per megabyte plummeted from $27 to $4 by 1997, and then to $2 by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Chips that sold for $50 in 1995 sold for $1 in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. South Korean semiconductor giants, facing the Asian financial crisis, flooded the market with memory wafers to stay afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   **Siemens' Financial Collapse:** Siemens Semiconductor, which made $65 million profit in the year ending September 1997, incurred a stunning loss of $722 million by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. This necessitated cost-cutting, with the UK plant being a target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.
*   **Lack of Scale and Backers:** The North Tyneside fab lacked scale, having only a third of the capacity of Siemens' Dresden plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. It had no significant backers within or outside the company; Siemens wouldn't touch its German or Austrian plants, and its US, French, and Taiwanese plants were joint ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. The pro-British management who initially pushed for the plant lost their jobs, and the new Siemens Semiconductor CEO was pro-Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

The closure was costly, estimated at nearly a quarter of a billion dollars, representing 45% of the division's projected loss that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Siemens also had to repay government grants, likely over 15 million pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. In August 1999, Siemens Semiconductor was spun off into Infineon Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

### The Atmel Attempt

In September 2000, semiconductor firm Atmel purchased the facility from Siemens for 25 million pounds ($35 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. Atmel produced higher-value products like flash NAND memory, radio frequency ICs, and logic products, avoiding commodity memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. They announced plans to invest 700 million pounds ($800 million USD) to retool the facility for flash memory and microcontroller circuits, which are more stable markets than DRAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

However, the dot-com crash in 2001 impacted Atmel, leading to a loss of 31 million pounds ($45 million USD) and a 23% decline in revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Atmel laid off 26% of its workforce (2,600 people) and interrupted its Northeast England investment plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Although there were rumors of recommitment, Atmel eventually adopted a "fab-light" model in 2006, leading them to sell four fabs, including North Tyneside, in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. TSMC bought all the production equipment, and the empty buildings were sold off, marking the end of the semiconductor dream for the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

Today, the fab facility has been transformed into the Cobalt Business Park, hosting government offices, call centers, and regional offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. The North Tyneside fab closure was part of a larger trend in 1998, which saw the loss of 3,400 manufacturing jobs in the region, including factories owned by Electrolux and Pringle, and eventually the Fujitsu fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

### Broader Context

The experience of the Siemens fab in North Tyneside highlights key themes related to:

The local economy's challenge remains its lack of native corporate leaders, as jobs were often provided by foreign companies with little attachment to the region, leading them to prioritize their homelands during financial crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. While Northeast England has not returned to its past glory, there are "green shoots" in the renewable energy sector, particularly a growing wind industry, exemplified by the Darker Bank wind farm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

The rapid ascent of the Daewoo Group was significantly bolstered by a "favorable political environment" and substantial debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The company's trajectory, from a small textile trading firm to one of Korea's largest conglomerates, was intricately linked to its close relationships with the government.

## Early Foundations and Favorable Treatment

Daewoo's founder, Kim Woo-joong, had personal connections that proved beneficial. His father served as the principal of Daegu Normal School, the primary school of future Korean president Park Chung-hee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This pre-existing connection laid a foundation for future influence.

Under President Park Chung-hee's administration in the 1960s, a strong focus was placed on building exports and strategic industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Companies that aligned with these goals received "favorable loans and funding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Daewoo was one such company, expanding into diverse sectors like machinery, shipbuilding, construction, and automobiles starting in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Direct Ties and Financial Benefits

Daewoo solidified its [[impact_of_government_relationships_on_hna_group | government relationships]] by regularly hiring "government elites and retired state bankers" for executive positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. These close ties enabled Daewoo to secure "absurdly favorable loans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. While private banks charged high interest rates (with annual inflation sometimes reaching 40%), Daewoo's loans were in the "six to nine percent range" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

In exchange for these preferential loans, monopoly protections, favorable labor laws, and silent backing, the chaebol (including Daewoo) "contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to their presidency's slush funds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Government-Driven Reforms

In the 1970s, the Korean government mandated that chaebol, including Daewoo, take their holding companies public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The stated reasons were to boost liquidity in the Korean stock markets and allow broader public participation in economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. While reluctant, chaebol complied after the government protected family control by curbing certain shareholder rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This led to complex cross-ownership structures that maintained family control despite diluted economic shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Shifting Landscape and Bailouts

The assassination of President Park Chung-hee in 1979 led to significant [[government_reforms_and_international_relations | government reforms and international relations]] that altered Korea's regulatory and economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Succeeding governments gradually "opened up the country's markets to foreign competition," and "cheap loans started to dry up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### The Shipbuilding Bailout and Moral Hazard

Despite these changes, Daewoo retained close political ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. In 1988, Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery faced near-bankruptcy due to high debt and a focus on revenues over sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Kim Woo-joong argued that the company had acquired the shipyard at Park Chung-hee's request, implying a government obligation for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

The Korean government ultimately bailed out Daewoo Shipbuilding in 1989, providing 200 billion Korean Won in preferential loans and directly injecting another 50 billion Won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This rescue plan "reaffirmed Daewoo's closeness to the government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

However, this created a "moral hazard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>, where Daewoo felt protected from the full consequences of its risky actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. The bailout funds, intended for shipbuilding, likely contributed to Daewoo Motors' subsequent aggressive global expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## Final Collapse and Aftermath

Leading into the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, Daewoo was the nation's "single most indebted company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Investors likely assumed the Korean government would intervene again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Daewoo engaged in discussions with the government for a bailout starting in June 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>, but the government demanded austerity measures that Kim Woo-joong resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

In late 1998, recognizing the "financial contagion risk of a Daewoo debt default" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, the Korean government restricted financial institutions from holding more than five percent of their portfolio in Daewoo Group debt, effectively cutting off Daewoo's credit lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Kim was confident the government would ease off on chaebol reform and provide another bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>, but this time, the faucet was turned off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

The company's eventual insolvency, marked by massive fraud and debt, led to its collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. The government had to inject public money to prevent banks from collapsing due to Daewoo's debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. This disaster prompted extensive reforms in investor transparency and banking oversight, as well as in the Korean accounting industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. Some of the missing funds from Daewoo are speculated to have been used for "bribes" paid to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

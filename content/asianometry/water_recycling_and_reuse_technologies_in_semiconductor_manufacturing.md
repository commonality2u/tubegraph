The [[semiconductor_water_usage_and_challenges | semiconductor manufacturing]] industry faces significant [[semiconductor_water_usage_and_challenges | water usage issues]] due to its high demand for ultra-pure water (UPW) and the substantial amount of wastewater generated [00:00:38]. These challenges are exacerbated in water-stressed regions, necessitating advanced water recycling and reuse technologies.

## The Intensive Water Requirements of Semiconductor Manufacturing

Water usage in industrial spaces, particularly [[semiconductor_water_usage_and_challenges | semiconductor manufacturing]], far exceeds residential consumption [00:01:28]. A significant portion of this water, approximately 30% to 40% of steps in modern wafer fabrication, is dedicated to wafer cleaning [00:01:37].

The process involves:
*   **Wet Cleaning** Sequential wash steps remove organics, metals, and particles from the wafer [00:01:46].
*   **Rinsing** Water is used to rinse off chemicals after each washing step [00:01:57].

Crucially, semiconductor companies cannot use regular tap water due to potential damage from particles [00:02:01]. Instead, they rely on "ultra pure water" (UPW) [00:02:11], which has stricter cleanliness standards than almost any other industry, including nuclear energy or chemical manufacturing [00:02:22]. The goal is to remove "killer particles" – microorganisms, organic particles, dissolved metals, and gases – that could affect a chip's nano-architecture [00:02:27].

### Generating Ultra Pure Water
Producing UPW is a complex process involving over a dozen steps, many of which are repeated in loops [00:02:44]. Approximately 6,000 liters (1,600 gallons) of city water are required to create 3,800 liters (1,000 gallons) of UPW [00:02:54]. A single 200mm (8-inch) wafer can consume over 5,600 liters (2,000 gallons) of UPW during its fabrication [00:03:01].

The type of circuit also impacts water usage:
*   Logic circuits, like microprocessors, require more layers and are more complex than memory ICs, display panels, or solar panels [00:03:25]. This complexity necessitates more water and energy for their manufacture [00:03:35].
*   Advanced process nodes demand increased cleanliness, leading to more layers to wash, more UPW needed, and more stringent standards for that UPW [00:04:02]. This means cutting-edge chips consume more water to fab than those from a decade ago, despite advances in water reuse [00:04:27].

## Managing Wastewater in Semiconductor Fabs

Semiconductor processes generate substantial amounts of wastewater, much of which requires treatment [00:04:45]. For example, in 2013, TSMC's fabs in Tainan generated 19 million tons of wastewater, compared to the entire city's 29 million tons that same year [00:04:50].

Wastewater from wet washing contains pollutants like ammonia, phosphate, and fluoride [00:05:00]. Not all wastewater is the same, with some requiring more expensive and extensive treatments than others [00:05:14].

## Water Recycling and Reuse Strategies

Large foundries like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel have implemented sophisticated water reuse and recycling technologies due to their massive scale [00:06:29].

### Wastewater Treatment and Internal Reuse
*   **Separation and Specialized Treatment** Large foundries separate different wastewater streams and apply specific treatments for over 25 chemicals [00:05:36].
*   **Treatment Technologies** Treatments range from relatively cheap ultraviolet light for disinfection [00:05:18] to more costly processes like reverse electrodialysis [00:05:25].
*   **Reusable Water** Some final treated water can be reintroduced into the system to generate more UPW [00:05:46].
*   **Cooling Tower Use** Non-reusable treated water is often directed to cooling towers, where it is evaporated to help maintain fab temperatures [00:05:53]. This cooling process is a significant consumer of a facility's energy and water after direct manufacturing [00:06:04].

While smaller companies might broadly treat and return water to the city for cost-effectiveness [00:06:12], major fabs rely on high recycling rates. TSMC's recycling rate in 2017 was 87% [00:06:41], significantly higher than the average semiconductor fab's 42% in a 2017 Singapore study [00:06:46].

### External Water Sourcing and Reclamation
To supplement their internal recycling efforts and manage the immense daily water consumption (TSMC's Tainan fabs alone consumed 50,000 metric tons/50 million liters of water daily in 2019 [00:06:54]), companies implement additional strategies:
*   **Rain Collection Systems** TSMC builds large rain collection systems to capture rainwater and store it in 700-ton tanks. This water can be processed for landscaping or sent to sewers after checks [00:07:28].
*   **Water Reclamation Plants** Companies sign tenders to build water reclamation plants near their fabs to recycle industrial wastewater [00:07:42]. These plants use advanced procedures like reverse osmosis, hollow fiber ultrafiltration, and sand filtration, similar to Singapore's "New Water" concept [00:07:48]. Facilities are being established in areas like Tainan Science Park, Yeongkong, and Unping [00:07:59].

## Economic and Political Drivers

Despite regions like Arizona being largely desert and facing significant water challenges (40% of water demand met by non-renewable groundwater [00:08:18]), semiconductor fabs are still sited there. This decision is driven by two main factors:

1.  **High Profitability** High-volume [[semiconductor_water_usage_and_challenges | semiconductor manufacturing]] is an extremely profitable and high-value-added industry [00:09:16]. Governments are willing to absorb the costs of building new water infrastructure or reallocating existing water supplies because the economic benefits, particularly through property taxation, are substantial [00:09:21]. A 2012 paper on Chandler, Arizona, found that the economic benefits from semiconductor manufacturing outweighed the costs of providing water, yielding significantly more revenue per acre compared to other land uses [00:09:52].
2.  **Investment in Water Saving Technologies** The semiconductor industry is affluent enough to invest heavily in water-saving, reusing, and recycling techniques [00:10:23]. This means a high percentage of water is theoretically returned to the wastewater system, far exceeding other land usages [00:10:31]. For foundries, this capability allows other regional advantages—such as a ready supply of educated talent, tax incentives, and seismic stability—to outweigh concerns about water scarcity [00:10:40].

Consequently, governments are incentivized to divert water, often from agricultural sectors which are the primary water users [00:11:09], to support semiconductor fabs [00:10:57]. This has been observed in both Taiwan and Arizona, where farmers' water allocations are being cut and diverted to tech companies [00:11:01].

The semiconductor industry's thirst for water is expected to continue with the progression of Moore's Law [00:11:39]. Therefore, continuous advancements in water recycling, reduction techniques, and reuse technologies are critical to ensure sustainable growth and prevent future water shortages [00:11:44].

[[Semiconductor industry water usage | Semiconductor manufacturing]] is a process that requires significant amounts of water, particularly [[ultrapure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] (UPW) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This need is only expected to increase as [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | manufacturing processes advance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Role of Ultra Pure Water

[[Semiconductor industry water usage | Water usage]] in industrial spaces, like [[semiconductor_manufacturing_process | semiconductor manufacturing]], far exceeds residential usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. A substantial portion of this water is dedicated to washing [[engineering_and_manufacturing_of_silicon_wafers | wafers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Why UPW is Essential
Approximately 30% to 40% of the steps in modern [[semiconductor_manufacturing_process | wafer fabrication]] involve some form of [[ultrapure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | wafer cleaning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For instance, a "wet cleaning" step involves sequential washes to remove organics, metals, and particles from the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Between these washing steps, water is used to rinse off chemicals from the previous stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Semiconductor companies cannot use regular tap water to wash these [[engineering_and_manufacturing_of_silicon_wafers | wafers]] due to the presence of particles that could damage the sensitive [[engineering_and_manufacturing_of_silicon_wafers | wafer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Instead, they must use [[ultrapure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]], an industry term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Cleanliness Standards
While [[ultrapure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] is used in other industries like nuclear energy and chemical manufacturing, the [[semiconductor_manufacturing_process | semiconductor industry]]'s cleanliness standards are stricter than almost all others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The goal is to remove "killer particles"â€”particles large enough to negatively affect a chip's nano-architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. These can include microorganism waste, organic particles, dissolved metals, and gases, all of which must be scrubbed out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### UPW Production
Generating and verifying the purity of [[ultrapure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] is an extensive process, involving over a dozen steps, many of which are repeated in multiple loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. It takes approximately 6,000 liters (1,600 gallons) of city water to create 3,800 liters (1,000 gallons) of [[ultrapure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Water Consumption in Fabrication

A single 200 millimeter (8 inch) [[engineering_and_manufacturing_of_silicon_wafers | wafer]] can consume over 5,600 liters (2,000 gallons) of [[ultrapure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The type of circuits being made also impacts [[semiconductor_industry_water_usage | water usage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

[[Engineering and manufacturing of silicon wafers | Wafers]] are made in layers, and each time a layer is applied, it needs to be washed and cleaned before the next layer can be added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Logic circuits, such as microprocessors, have more layers and are more complex than other [[semiconductors | semiconductor]] types like memory ICs, display panels, or [[purification_and_processing_of_silicon_for_semiconductors_and_solar_cells | solar panels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Consequently, their manufacturing requires more water and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Increasing Demand with Advanced Nodes
In 2020, TSMC reported that they were unable to meet their water consumption goals set years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. They had aimed to reduce the liters of water consumed per 8-inch [[engineering_and_manufacturing_of_silicon_wafers | wafer]] equivalent layer by 27% but only achieved 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This shortfall was attributed to increased demands for process cleanliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The more advanced a process node becomes, the "thirstier" it tends to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This means more layers to wash, more [[ultrapure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] needed, and more stringent standards for that UPW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. With each new process node, the threshold for a "killer particle" shrinks, making it harder to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. As a result, cutting-edge chips today require more water to fabricate than they did 10 years ago, despite [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | advances in water reuse and conservation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This trend is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Wastewater Treatment and Recycling

[[Semiconductor manufacturing process | Semiconductor processes]] generate a significant amount of [[wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | wastewater]], much of which requires treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. For example, in 2013, TSMC's fabs in Tainan generated 19 million tons of wastewater, compared to the entire city's 29 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

[[Wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | Wastewater]] from wet washing contains high levels of pollutants like ammonia, phosphate, and fluoride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Different types of wastewater require more expensive and extensive treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Large foundries separate these streams and apply specific treatments, addressing over 25 chemicals in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Water Reuse and Conservation
Some of the final treated water can be reused to generate more [[ultrapure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Water that isn't reusable is often put into cooling towers, where it is evaporated to help maintain fab temperatures, which is the single biggest use of a facility's energy and water after direct manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

Implementing such a water management system is complex and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Smaller companies may find it more cost-effective to broadly treat their water and return it to the city once minimum health and safety requirements are met, then obtain new raw water from the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. However, large fabs like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel must implement these [[wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | water reuse and recycling technologies]] due to their scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Without them, they would quickly run out of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

For instance, TSMC's recycle rate in 2017 was 87%, while the average [[semiconductor_manufacturing_process | semiconductor fab]] recycled less than half of that (42%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. In 2019, TSMC's fabs in Tainan alone consumed 50,000 metric tons (50 million liters) of water daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

To manage water supply, companies like TSMC have optimized their water draw and usage, in addition to [[wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | recycling technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. They build large rain collection systems with 700-ton tanks to capture and store rainwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The company has also signed tenders to build water reclamation plants near its fabs, which will recycle industrial [[wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | wastewater]] using processes like reverse osmosis, hollow fiber ultrafiltration, and sand filtration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. These procedures are similar to Singapore's "New Water" initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### [[Water_shortages_and_droughts_impact_on_semiconductor_manufacturing | Regional Water Challenges]]
Taiwan has experienced severe droughts, particularly in areas like Tainan, Kaohsiung, Taitung, and Hsinchu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. TSMC has budgeted millions of dollars to truck water to its fabs in Tainan during these times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. In Tainan, the area draws from the Nan Hua and Zengwen reservoirs, which have faced dangerously low capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

Similarly, companies like TSMC and Intel are building fabs in Arizona, a state that is largely desert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Arizona's water supply relies significantly on non-renewable groundwater and the Colorado River, with reclaimed water making up the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This reliance on groundwater is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

Despite these [[water_shortages_and_droughts_impact_on_semiconductor_manufacturing | water challenges]], the [[economic_impacts_of_semiconductor_facilities_on_water_resources | economic benefits]] of high-volume [[semiconductor_manufacturing_process | semiconductor manufacturing]] are such that governments are willing to incur the costs of building water infrastructure or reallocating water from other sectors, primarily agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. A 2012 paper found that the [[economic_impacts_of_semiconductor_facilities_on_water_resources | economic benefits]] from [[semiconductor_manufacturing_process | semiconductor manufacturing]] outweigh the costs of providing water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This is because governments receive significantly more revenue on a per-acre basis from [[semiconductor_manufacturing_process | semiconductor manufacturing]] compared to other land usages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

Additionally, the [[semiconductor_manufacturing_process | industry]] is wealthy enough to invest heavily in [[wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | water-saving, reusing, and recycling techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, allowing a high percentage of water to be theoretically returned to the [[wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | wastewater]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

The [[semiconductor_manufacturing_process | industry's]] demand for water is expected to continue growing as [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Moore's Law]] pushes further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. [[Wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | Water recycling]], reduction techniques, and reuse [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | technologies]] must keep pace to ensure sufficient water supply for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

India initially advocated for a global ban on nuclear weapons, with Mahatma Gandhi stating in 1947 that they represented a "sinful and diabolical use of science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Following the atomic bombings in Japan, India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, voiced concerns that the bomb would be a weapon exclusively for killing Asians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. India's desire was for a world without nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. However, despite this initial stance, India became the sixth declared nuclear power on May 18, 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Foundations of the Atomic Program

India's entire atomic program began with [[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Dr. Homi Bhabha]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Born into a prominent and wealthy Parsi family, Bhabha's uncle by marriage was Sir Dorabji Tata, son of Tata Group founder Jamshedji Tata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Bhabha earned a PhD in physics from Cambridge, where he researched cosmic rays and interacted with Western physics figures like Paul Dirac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

In 1939, Bhabha was in India for a holiday when World War II broke out, preventing his return to Cambridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Initially viewing this as a temporary disruption, he sought opportunities to return to the United Kingdom or the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, feeling intellectually isolated in India, which was turbulent amidst its fight for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

By 1943-1944, as India's independence became clear, Bhabha recognized an opportunity to make a transformative impact on his new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. In March 1944, he wrote to the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, a philanthropic trust of the Tata family, requesting funds for a "vigorous school of research" to conduct world-class science in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This led to the founding of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in 1945, funded with a lavish budget that grew significantly over its first two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. TIFR became the "cradle of India's atomic energy program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Securing Resources

India possesses abundant thorium, a non-fissile material that can be converted into fissile uranium-233 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Early challenges for India's nuclear history included acquiring and controlling thorium, particularly from the Travancore principality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Travancore, a princely state indirectly ruled by the UK, was rich in monazite, India's only known source of nuclear ore at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. In January 1947, Travancore's Dewar, Sir CP Ramaswami Aiyar, struck a three-year deal with the British for monazite access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. However, the Indian government, with Nehru even considering air power, pressured Travancore to join the union, eventually securing control over its nuclear ores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Establishment of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)

In 1948, Nehru proposed creating the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) of India, with Bhabha as its chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The AEC received substantial government protection, with Bhabha reporting directly to the Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Nehru and Bhabha, sharing similar Cambridge educational backgrounds, worked effectively together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Nehru was primarily interested in nuclear science for its potential to accelerate India's development and enhance its prestige, seeing it as crucial for industrialization and economic advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. While publicly opposing nuclear weapons, Nehru recognized "the reality of the world" and wished to keep the option open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This dual policy granted Bhabha the autonomy to develop the necessary infrastructure for a weapons program should the need arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Finding Partners and International Relations

In its early years, India sought to leverage its thorium and other strategic minerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Agreements with France in 1948 and 1950 included plans for a monazite processing plant and joint research on beryllium-moderated reactors, marking the first bilateral [[international_relations_and_indias_quest_for_nuclear_technology | international nuclear project]] after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

In 1952, Bhabha proposed a trade with the American AEC chairman, Gordon Dean, seeking declassified reactor information and heavy water in exchange for thorium and uranium ores, and possibly beryllium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Despite strained relations due to India's non-alignment policy, the global demand for strategic nuclear ores brought the Americans to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The US feared India deepening ties with the Soviets, especially after the Chinese Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

A notable incident occurred in July 1953, when an Indian state-owned enterprise shipped thorium nitrate to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This caused alarm in the Eisenhower Administration, as it could trigger automatic termination of US aid under the Mutual Defense Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Nehru resisted US dictates on trade, and a deal was eventually arranged for the Americans to buy the thorium at a high price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Pakistan's subsequent courtship of the US, emphasizing anti-Communist sympathies, further deepened India's antipathy towards the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### Internal Criticism and AEC's Response

The AEC's power was not absolute, and [[criticism_and_challenges_faced_by_indias_atomic_energy_commission | critics disliked Bhabha's control]] over India's atomic institutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Indian astrophysicist Meghnad Saha, a Communist aligned with the Soviet Union, became a vocal critic after winning a seat in Parliament in 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Saha criticized the AEC's "lack of results, lack of transparency, and its close ties to private enterprises like the Tata Group" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. In 1954, he expressed skepticism about the AEC's ability to set up a nuclear reactor within their announced timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Saha also argued against the notion of "special" atomic scientists, advocating for better utilization of India's broader human resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

Many Indians shared the belief that the pursuit of atomic energy was an expensive "boondoggle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. The AEC had become too theoretical and insulated, neglecting industrial practicalities, making a real reactor decades away domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Public scrutiny pushed the AEC to demonstrate results, necessitating foreign assistance or reactor purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### "Atoms for Peace" and Bhabha's Three-Step Plan

In December 1953, Dwight Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" speech at the UN marked a shift in global nuclear policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This initiative sought to supply atomic equipment and information to other countries, promoting peaceful uses of atomic energy and opening doors for commercial competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This reversal of prior secrecy greatly benefited India's atomic energy and potential weapons program due to the inherent duality of nuclear technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

In response to criticisms, Nehru asked the AEC to hold a national conference in November 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. At this Conference on the Development of Atomic Energy for Peaceful Purposes in New Delhi, Bhabha outlined his three-step plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>:
1.  **Step One**: Build atomic reactors fueled with natural uranium, with foreign assistance, producing plutonium as a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
2.  **Step Two**: Build new reactors fueled by a mix of thorium and plutonium from the first stage, producing uranium-233 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
3.  **Step Three**: Use uranium-233 with India's thorium in "breeder" reactors to create an "essentially unlimited supply of nuclear fuel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

Bhabha's plan was designed for national independence and strategic optionality, leveraging India's thorium reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. The production of plutonium in the second stage provided India with the option to build nuclear weapons if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. The conference solidified Bhabha's control, and Nehru increased the program's budget twelve-fold by 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

### Reactor Acquisition

India sought international aid to build a nuclear reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. In June 1954, Bhabha contacted Sir John Cockcroft, head of the UK's Atomic Energy Authority, asking for heavy water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Although heavy water was unavailable, Cockcroft offered to help with a "swimming pool" type research reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. The UK supplied enriched fuel rods, technical drawings, and data, with India promising special consideration for future reactor purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. This 1-megawatt reactor, named "Apsara," went live in August 1956, becoming Asia's first nuclear reactor outside the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Nehru lauded it in January 1957 as "almost entirely" the work of young Indian scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

At the first "Atoms for Peace" conference in Geneva in August 1955, where Bhabha served as president, Canada proposed transferring one of their research reactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. The agreement led to Canada building a 40-megawatt heavy water reactor, the Canadian-Indian Reactor, US (CIRUS), in India, with Canada covering foreign exchange costs and the US providing heavy water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. Bhabha fiercely rejected Canada's initial request for international custody of the fuel, asserting India's "inalienable right" to hold its own fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. Canada ultimately did not impose strict restrictions beyond a "pinky-swear promise" for peaceful use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. CIRUS went critical in July 1960 and reached full capacity by 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. CIRUS's design encouraged the production of large amounts of weapons-grade plutonium by allowing fuel rods to be replaced while the reactor was operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

Simultaneously, India began building Phoenix, a plutonium reprocessing plant in Trombay, which could extract plutonium from spent nuclear fuel like that from CIRUS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. The plant was indigenously built with legitimate plans transferred from Vitro International, an American company involved in the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. By 1962, India knew it could gather enough weapons-grade plutonium for a bomb within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. This capability likely prompted the hurried passage of the 1962 Atomic Energy Act in September 1962, which restricted information on the program and granted the government rights to mine and seize land for nuclear development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. When Phoenix went live in June 1964, India was about a year away from having enough plutonium for a test bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

## Nehru's Hesitancy and Geopolitical Pressures

Despite having the materials for a bomb by 1965, India did not produce it for many more years, largely due to Nehru and other influential groups being against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. They maintained the option but hesitated to pursue weaponization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

The Sino-Indian border clashes escalating in summer 1962 culminated in the People's Liberation Army attacks on October 20, 1962, leading to a humiliating national loss for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. This war motivated India to significantly improve its defense capacity, doubling the military budget in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. The right-wing Jana Sangh Party, an ancestor of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, publicly advocated for India to build the Bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

However, Nehru did not proceed with weaponization. While increasing state support for atomic programs (raising the 1963 budget by 76%) to keep options open, he remained firm against actually building a bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. He argued that doing so would contradict India's consistent calls for nuclear powers to cease testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

Nehru's health declined from 1962, and he passed away in May 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. Until his death, he maintained that atomic bombs would not aid India's growth, though he acknowledged that they might become necessary someday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

### China's Nuclear Test and the Subsequent Debate

A new administration led by Lal Bahadur Shastri took over in June 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. He immediately faced threats from Pakistan and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. Pakistan, alarmed by closer India-US ties after the 1962 war, deepened its relationship with China, including public border delineation in December 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.

On September 29, 1964, the Americans publicly announced an imminent [[chinese_scientists_contributions_to_nuclear_development | Chinese nuclear weapons test]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. China had been working on a bomb since 1958, and Soviet assistance made its detonation inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. The Chinese test on October 16 deeply impacted the Indian political class, leading to a split in the ruling Congress Party on how to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.

[[dr_homi_bhabha_and_the_foundation_of_indias_atomic_program | Dr. Bhabha]] led a faction advocating for India to build the bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. On October 4, 1964, he told journalists in London that India was just 18 months away from a nuclear weapon, subtly pushing for the bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. US President Lyndon Johnson tried to downplay the Chinese test and reassure India against pursuing its own weapon, but without solid guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.

The debate intensified in India. The Jana Sangh party escalated its rhetoric for a bomb, criticizing the government's "ahimsic [non-violent] idiocy" for not developing the bomb sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. A survey of Indian elites by the *Indian Express* in late October found belief in Bhabha's 18-month claim (likely an exaggeration) but urged responsible thinking against rushing into weaponization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. Concerns were raised about the huge costs of a nuclear weapons program amidst rising inflation and food shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. Bhabha countered these concerns, publicly stating on October 24 at the UN that 50 atomic bombs would cost only $21 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>, a misleading figure that excluded infrastructure costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

Many elites also disputed the relevance of China's nuclear weapons to India, viewing them as directed at superpowers and the "nuclear monopoly of the western powers," not India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. Ultimately, for Shastri, the more pressing issue was solving India's ongoing food shortage crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. He continued to advocate for a non-bomb policy and possibly a nuclear umbrella from the West, while also mentioning a program for "peaceful nuclear explosions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

### The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965

The Indo-Pakistani War in 1965, which caused thousands of casualties, brought the threat of Pakistan back to the forefront in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. During the conflict, China, backing Pakistan, threatened nuclear retaliation if India did not halt its progress, but Shastri denied the ultimatum, and China withdrew its threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. The US halting military exports to both India and Pakistan destroyed trust in a Western nuclear umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>. These events fueled arguments within India for building a bomb, as China's threats were seen as bullying, and India felt it could only depend on itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.

This period of political turmoil culminated in Shastri's sudden death in January 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. [[indias_path_to_nuclear_detonation_under_indira_gandhi | Indira Gandhi]], Nehru's daughter, became Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. On the same day she was sworn in, Bhabha died in a plane crash at age 56, never seeing India become a nuclear weapons power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. These two deaths created a significant void in India's nuclear policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

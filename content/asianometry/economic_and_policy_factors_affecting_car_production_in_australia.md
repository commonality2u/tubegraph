Once employing 100,000 people and producing tens of thousands of vehicles for both domestic consumption and export, the Australian automobile industry has largely vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The last major factory, operated by Toyota, closed in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Early Industry Development and Government Support

Emerging from World War II, the Australian government sought to rebuild its economy and nurture manufacturing capacity, with car manufacturing being a high priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Foreign companies were offered subsidies and tax concessions to encourage production on Australian soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Manufacturers like Volkswagen, British Motors Leyland, and Ford entered the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. While most facilities primarily bolted together imported parts, GM Holden, an Australian subsidiary of an American automaker, produced the first "all-Australian car" in 1948, named the Holden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Manufactured in Melbourne, the Holden was a rugged car suited for Australia's rural areas and dominated the market throughout the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. By 1951, Holden sold over 25,000 units and was the country's most profitable publicly traded company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

This domestic manufacturing industry grew within a protected market, with high tariffs guaranteeing demand for domestic employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. These employers could pass on the costs of paying a "fair and reasonable basic wage," supported by powerful trade unions and a unique compulsory arbitration system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Local auto manufacturing supported a local auto parts ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### [[impact_of_foreign_multinationals_on_australian_car_manufacturing | Impact of Foreign Ownership]]

The Australian car maker companies were not owned by Australians, but rather by large multinational firms like Volkswagen, Toyota, and GM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Upsides**: The industry benefited from being part of a larger globalized network, allowing Australian-made auto components to be produced at scale and exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Downsides**: The companies could not embed themselves deeply within the local industry, and profits flowed to overseas headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Executives back home had no emotional attachment to Australia, making decisions based on the bottom line, which meant Australia did not control its own automaking destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Decline in the 1970s

By the early 1970s, the domestic automotive manufacturing industry employed over 100,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. However, the 1970s saw a substantial loss of competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>:
*   **Lack of Economies of Scale**: Automakers produced too many models (five companies producing up to 15), with individual production runs as small as 25,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Customer Disconnect**: Australian cars were treasured for their rural ruggedness, but most of the population lived in cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Japanese Imports**: Gaps in the market, particularly in the small car segment, allowed high-quality, low-cost Japanese imports to gain a significant foothold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### [[role_of_australian_government_in_the_automobile_industrys_decline | Government Policy Shifts]]

The 1972 election of the Whitlam government marked a shift towards substantial reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This administration, being the first Labor Party government in 32 years, did not favor foreign multinational-owned carmakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

In 1973, with the Australian economy near full capacity and concerns about rising inflation, the government strengthened the Australian currency and sought to reduce tariffs and trade barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Officials believed a more liberal trade policy was needed to inject competition, expecting the economy to survive a rapid drop in trade protections due to expanding international trade opportunities, particularly with Japan, and increasing mineral exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

A controversial 25% reduction in all tariffs on imported goods in 1973 was implemented abruptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This confrontational tactic led to industry opposition, with GM Holden firing 5,000 workers, sparking a political crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Economic Shocks and Market Transformation

The OPEC oil embargo and the collapse of the Bretton Woods international monetary regime in 1973 ended post-war prosperity, causing oil prices, inflation, and unemployment to soar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This spurred sales of gas-sipping alternatives, particularly small and medium four-cylinder cars dominated by Japanese manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. While absolute sales of large six-cylinder cars remained flat, their share of the overall market collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This represented a "disruptive innovation" where upstarts (Japanese imports) gained a foothold and relentlessly moved upmarket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

Toyota and Nissan established domestic Australian assembly operations to avoid tariffs, further bloating the domestic market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Nissan's plant in Clayton, Victoria, hosted eight trade unions, creating tensions given Nissan's anti-union history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

Thousands of jobs were lost throughout the 1970s as the six-cylinder market declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. British Motors Leyland closed its Australian operations in 1975, cutting 2,600 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. The South Australian government argued another 15,000 automaker jobs were at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. The worsening economic situation forced the government to reimpose import quotas in 1974-1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

A major missing ingredient was a government entity to coordinate the industry's transition, unlike Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) which arranged mergers to create giants like Toyota and Nissan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The four remaining domestic OEMs struggled to navigate this new world alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### Collapse of Export Market

The macro trends affecting the domestic market also annihilated the export market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. The rise of Japan and China edged out traditional winners like Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. In 1970, Australia produced 60,000 cars for export, a number that dwindled to just a few hundred by 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. The collapse of exports signaled to officials that the domestic car industry was uncompetitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## Deregulation and Further Decline in the 1980s-2000s

The mid-1980s saw major macroeconomic policy changes, including banking sector deregulation, financial market liberalization, and floating the Australian dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The intention was to reorient domestic manufacturing towards exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Prime Minister Hawke criticized past tariffs for creating inefficient industries that couldn't compete overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

The "New Car Plan," introduced in late 1983 by Senator John Button, offered car manufacturers credits and subsidies for Australian-made cars, along with temporary government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. However, it also rapidly reduced import tariffs from 57.5% to 45% by 1988, with further reductions until 2000, and removed import quotas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

The industry did shrink, with Ford losing $60 million in 1992 and laying off thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Plant closures by all domestic automakers occurred throughout the 1980s and 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Australian-made cars became less competitive, with domestic carmakers reducing investment in R&D and manufacturing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Foreign companies had primarily entered Australia to bypass trade protections, and when these vanished, there was little reason to maintain expensive manufacturing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

### Final Collapse in the 2000s

Domestic assembly operations stabilized at around 350,000 units a year through the 1990s and early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. However, the domestic makers' share of the overall market continued to shrink due to population and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This occurred despite annual government support of AUD 500 million through schemes like the Automotive Competitive and Investment Scheme (ACIS), which cost the government AUD 7 billion from 2001 to 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

The start of a decades-long mining boom in 2000, fueled by countries like China and India, caused a dramatic appreciation of the Australian dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The Australian dollar doubled in value from 50 cents to the American dollar in 2001 to parity over the next 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. This stronger currency dramatically increased the cost of Australian automotive production, leading to chronic losses for the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. From 2003 to 2010, the industry lost 25,000 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

In April 2004, Mitsubishi announced the closure of its engine and assembly plants in southern Adelaide, resulting in 1,167 job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. The region heavily depended on manufacturing, which made up 18% of employment in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. The federal government provided AUD 40 million for the region and AUD 10 million to help retrenched Mitsubishi workers, with the state government adding AUD 5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. However, this funding was insufficient, as each domestically produced Mitsubishi car was already receiving AUD 1,300 in subsidies by 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. Mitsubishi's plant closed for good in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

The global financial crisis (GFC) in 2008 led to further government interventions, including the Green Car Innovation Fund and the Automotive Transformation Scheme, which subsidized investment and research in energy efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. The government also provided a AUD 200 million line of credit to GM Holden after GM filed for bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. The Mitsubishi closure is seen as the beginning of the end for Australia's automotive industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.

### Government Stance and Industry Exit

The 2013 change in government, with the Abbott Liberal-National coalition replacing the Labor Party, marked a shift in policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. The new conservative-leaning government disagreed with previous interventions, stating that the "government's role is not to prop up private business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. They questioned why cars should receive preferential treatment and subsidies when other manufacturing sectors were also hurting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.

The Australian automobile manufacturing industry was a shadow of its former self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. Modern car manufacturers aim to produce about 250,000 cars per factory per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>:
*   GM Holden produced 160,000 in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.
*   Mitsubishi struggled to produce 35,000 in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.
*   Ford produced about 70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

Australian labor was expensive, costing multiples more than labor in emerging low-cost manufacturing hubs like China and Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. While unions in countries like Canada and the United States made concessions on wages and production lines, Australian labor unions came around late in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. Ultimately, government support was more critical than union-employer relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

Industry-government relations deteriorated, with Finance Minister Joe Hockey famously dismissing GM's approaches by saying, "Either you're here or you're not" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. Constant delays in new government policies created an "overhanging cloud of instability," leading Toyota and GM to pull out, as businesses value stability and lasting commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

## Consequences of the Industry's Demise

The loss of Australia's domestic auto industry had wide-ranging consequences:
*   **Domestic Components Industry**: 260 Australian businesses supplied the automotive sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. Without the domestic assembly industry as an anchor, many of these could not achieve sufficient economies of scale and closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. For instance, 70% of the Toyota Camry's parts had once been made in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.
*   **Research and Development (R&D)**: R&D spending by Australian automotive companies vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. In its final years, companies spent AUD 700 million on R&D, making up 2% of the country's entire R&D spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.
*   **Laid-off Workers**: Approximately 14,000 people lost their jobs after the Toyota and GM Holden factories closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. A survey found many were older men with immigrant backgrounds; less than half were still working two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. Government and community support helped cushion the financial blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.
*   **Cultural Impact**: The industry's demise closed a uniquely Australian chapter of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. Despite foreign ownership, Australian cars were seen as embodying the "pioneering spirit" and the "backyard inventor" thriving against odds in the harsh outback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.

## [[rise_and_fall_of_australian_automobile_industry | Blame and Lessons Learned]]

There are no clear heroes or villains in the [[rise_and_fall_of_australian_automobile_industry | rise and fall of Australia's automobile industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Australia benefits from natural resources but faces challenges due to its remote location and higher costs of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. While the government invested billions, the economics and economies of scale were ultimately not there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

### [[comparison_of_australian_and_international_automobile_industries | Comparison to Other Countries]]

Canada is often cited as an example of an auto industry that survived despite high labor costs and a strong currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. The Canadian government did consolidate its auto industry, but Canada shares a border with the United States, and its factories are far more productive, with an average output three times higher than Australia's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.

One criticism is that the government could have been more involved at critical times, similar to Japan's MITI, which arranged mergers between carmakers to create national champions like Toyota and Nissan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. It is pondered whether forcibly merging the five domestic OEMs into one and investing a controlling share might have saved the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

Despite the closure of local manufacturing, Toyota and other automakers continue to tap Australia's educated labor for developing new automotive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. The former Toyota Altona factory is being converted into a transport hub for green hydrogen technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

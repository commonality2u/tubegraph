SMIC has recently gained attention for producing chips using its own 7nm process node, known as N+2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This development has sparked discussion regarding the [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node|economic viability of SMIC's chip production]] given current market dynamics and export restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### SMIC's N+2 Node and Technology
SMIC's N+2 node is a derivative of its N+1 process, which first taped out in October 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Both N+1 and N+2 utilize DUV immersion lithography with multi-patterning, a technique commonly used by foundries before the widespread adoption of EUV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. While SMIC's N+2 is capable of using EUV, the company's attempts to purchase EUV devices from ASML have been blocked by a U.S. export ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Analysts from SemiAnalysis and TechInsights note that SMIC's N+2 is nearly identical (99% similar) to TSMC's N7 node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This similarity means that the physical measurements of its transistors (finfets) and their placements are comparable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. TSMC first shipped N7 chips in high volume in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, which puts SMIC approximately four to six years behind the leading edge in terms of high-volume equivalent node production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

Although SMIC's N+2 is one of the most advanced processes available from any foundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, the question remains whether it is economically competitive without EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. It is technically possible to fabricate chips at nodes more advanced than N7 using 193nm immersion technology and multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Dr. Burn Lin, a former TSMC R&D director, stated in January 2022 that SMIC could even fab N5 equivalent chips using only multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

However, producing a few wafers is not enough; the key challenge is whether the node can yield meaningful quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Companies like Samsung and Intel have famously struggled with chip yields on advanced nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:04:04]</a>. Given that N+2 is very similar to TSMC's N7, which TSMC ramped up without significant reported issues, SMIC's N+2 is likely to follow a similar yield optimization curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Economic Competitiveness in an Open Market
In an open market, SMIC's N+2 node faces significant challenges to its economic viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. A foundry with EUV technology possesses economic advantages over those relying solely on DUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. An N7-equivalent node built with only multi-patterning has manufacturing limitations that impose serious design restrictions on chip designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Furthermore, TSMC offers a better-performing N7 equivalent in its N6 node, which is an evolution of N7 and is equipped with EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Therefore, in an open and competitive market, SMIC's N+2 would likely not be economically competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### SMIC's N+2 as a China-Only Product
It is possible that SMIC anticipates N+2 to primarily serve as a China-only product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The close similarity of N+2 to TSMC's N7 could potentially involve trade secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. TSMC successfully obtained product import bans on SMIC products made with TSMC trade secrets in U.S. courts in 2002 and 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. If TSMC were to pursue similar legal action and succeed, it would eliminate N+2's viability as an export product, limiting its use to domestic Chinese products and exports to friendly countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. While SMIC highlights its export capability to countries like the U.S. in earnings calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, they may no longer depend on it.

### Domestic Demand and Strategic Partnerships
The Chinese chip design and electronics industries have matured significantly since the mid-2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. [[huawei_and_smics_semiconductor_collaboration|Huawei's HiSilicon]], once China's largest semiconductor company, is a strong candidate to utilize N+2 for high-performing Chinese mobile processors for its phones and server chips for its cloud services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. HiSilicon is familiar with TSMC's N7, having been a flagship customer alongside Apple, fabricating Kirin 980, 985, and 990 series chips on that node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

This partnership could be mutually beneficial, as foundries rely on massive production volumes to scale and yield optimize their process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. [[huawei_and_smics_semiconductor_collaboration|HiSilicon and SMIC]] together could become a formidable duo, leading to continuous improvement of the N+2 node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. TSMC, for example, shipped millions of N7 wafers for companies like Apple before EUV arrived, becoming proficient in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. SMIC is expected to follow a similar trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Factors Driving SMIC's Advancement
China has prioritized leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing since the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. A key figure in SMIC's recent progress is co-CEO Liang Bong Song, a TSMC alumnus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Known for his technical brilliance and relentless pursuit of the leading edge, Liang joined SMIC in 2017 from Samsung, bringing a 200-person R&D team and reorienting the company towards leading-edge manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. As long as Liang remains in his role, SMIC is likely to continue its push toward the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### Impact of Export Controls
Access to the latest lithography technologies is critical for SMIC's advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Recent news indicates the U.S. government is urging the Netherlands (ASML) and Japan (Nikon) to prevent the export of their immersion DUV lithography machines to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This timing likely coincides with the N+2 shipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

While the U.S. has long blocked the export of advanced EUV machines to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, expanding the block to immersion lithography marks another significant step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Immersion machines, which use water to improve resolution, are the workhorses of modern semiconductor manufacturing, with prototypes entering the market in 2003 and only two current suppliers: ASML and Nikon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Dry ARF machines can be modified into immersion lithography machines, a process that can take less than five years, though it requires substantial technical effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. An N7 equivalent node demands more sophisticated immersion technologies, extending this timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

An export ban on 193nm immersion lithography technology, without a corresponding ban on dry ARF technology (which seems unfeasible), would likely add four to six years to SMIC's progress toward the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Such a ban would also stimulate significant investment in Chinese-made lithography equipment, initially for maintaining existing immersion equipment and then for facilitating the dry-to-immersion transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Whether Chinese companies can eventually ship complete systems comparable to ASML or Nikon is debatable, with a gap of several years, though it's not insurmountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

Ultimately, a legitimate 7nm node at high volume and good yield represents a triumph for China's advanced manufacturing industry, as only three other companies have reached this level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Any successful immersion ban would not be a permanently damaging blow but would maintain and perhaps slightly expand the Sino-American semiconductor gap, buying a few precious years for the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This strategy echoes the American response to the Japanese semiconductor challenge decades ago, where government intervention bought time for the industry to innovate and improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

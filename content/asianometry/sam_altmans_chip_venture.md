Sam Altman of OpenAI has reportedly been developing a substantial chip venture aimed at supporting the [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Initial reports, which surfaced around the time of his temporary removal from OpenAI, indicated he was seeking billions in funding from Middle East investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Discussions for this venture have reportedly taken place with [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | TSMC]], entities in Abu Dhabi, and the US Government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Trillion-Dollar Investment

A Wall Street Journal report, published while the author was traveling, brought to light an "eye-catching $1-7 trillion" figure associated with Altman's plans, sparking widespread discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Many in Silicon Valley considered this figure to be excessive, suggesting it might be a negotiating tactic to set high expectations for future talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The Information provided additional context, stating that Altman privately indicated this figure represented the cumulative investment participants would need to make over several years across various areas, including real estate, power for data centers, and the manufacturing of chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This "ecosystem concept" offers a more logical explanation for the vast sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

To put this in perspective, total semiconductor sales in 2023 were approximately $520 billion, with total capital expenditures estimated at $140 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Even if the trillion-dollar figure were spread over five years and diluted with real estate and power expenses, it would still represent a significant increase in capital expenditure, akin to a "COVID-like step function upwards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The semiconductor industry is noted as conservative, with many experienced individuals having witnessed numerous boom and bust cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Scaling Laws as the Driving Concept

The underlying concept propelling this investment is known as "scaling laws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This term originated from a 2020 OpenAI paper titled "Scaling laws for neural language models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The core idea is that combining more data and compute resources leads to improved results, specifically less loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

This concept was crucial for OpenAI in developing the GPT-series of models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI co-founder, stated in a November podcast that previous neural networks were ineffective due to their small size, implying that much larger networks enable unprecedented capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. GPT-3 was large, GPT-4 was even larger and performed better, and GPT-5 is expected to be larger still, with no current signs that scaling laws are breaking down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

There are interesting parallels between scaling laws and the semiconductor industry's [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Moore's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. While the two "laws" are different, they could have similar impacts on their respective industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Moore's Law]] served as a rallying cry and metronome for the semiconductor industry from the 1980s to the 1990s, guiding R&D roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Similarly, scaling laws could significantly influence the [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

Arguments against scaling laws include concerns about exhausting existing internet data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. However, the semiconductor industry has historically overcome physics-related challenges to [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Moore's Law]] by developing new engineering solutions, such as High-K Metal Gate, FinFET, and DUV Lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. A key question remains whether sufficient funding will be available to sustain this investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Financial Sustainability of the AI Boom

A critical question is whether the current [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI boom]], including ventures like Altman's, is truly "Real" in terms of financial sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Despite impressive technological advancements, such as OpenAI's Sora model, the technology itself does not inherently constitute a hit product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. There is a perceived need to embed these technologies into compelling products to generate consumer revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

The massive investments driven by [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Moore's Law]] in the semiconductor industry were supported by tangible demand from various sectors: initially the military, then consumer electronics (radios, calculators), followed by personal computers, smartphones, and cloud computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. These were products ordinary people desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Significant investments in [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI]] are unlikely to materialize unless consumers broadly adopt [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI]] services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

While ChatGPT reportedly achieved a $2 billion run-rate revenue in December 2023, making it one of the fastest-growing consumer tech products, solid evidence of widespread consumer payment for LLM services remains limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. For comparison, the iPhone, released in June 2007, sold 20 million units and generated $13 billion in revenue by 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

Microsoft Copilot, a $20-a-month subscription service, is another product closely watched by the industry as a potential indicator of mass adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

Ultimately, the most significant impact of the LLM revolution might come from its integration into existing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Examples include [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI]] automation in advertising sales, such as Google's Performance Max ads, which generate tens of billions of dollars by automating ad creation, deployment, and targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Another instance is Meta's ability to regain targeting accuracy after Apple's 2021 cookie tracking changes, achieved through [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI]] and data collection from its Conversions API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

Some argue that [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI]] serves primarily as an enabling technology, enhancing the capabilities of existing wealthy entities rather than creating a new class of wealthy individuals, unlike previous innovations such as the PC or electrification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. If this is the case, it could be seen as disappointing, yet it still confirms the "reality" of the [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI boom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

In 2024, lithium-ion battery pack prices experienced their most significant price cut since 2017, falling 20% to $115 per kilowatt-hour, as reported by Bloomberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This trend has made Chinese batteries cheaper even with substantial tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. A key driver behind this development is the advancements in Lithium Ion Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Once considered cheap and low-end due to fundamental chemistry weaknesses, LFP batteries have seen significant engineering improvements, primarily led by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## The Three Chemistries

Lithium-ion batteries consist of two electrodes: a cathode and an anode, with the anode typically being graphite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The cathode is the most expensive component, accounting for over 70% of the battery's value, and serves as the primary differentiator between chemistries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

The industry primarily uses three major lithium-ion battery chemistries:

1.  **Ternary Batteries**: These batteries are named for their cathodes, which blend three materials:
    *   **Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
    *   **Nickel Cobalt Aluminum (NCA)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>

    Ternary batteries offer higher energy densities, meaning they can store more energy in a smaller size and weight, enabling lighter battery packs and potentially longer electric vehicle (EV) ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. NCA batteries, for example, typically range from 230 to 260 watt-hours per kilogram, while NMC batteries are the highest at 250 to 320 watt-hours per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. However, this comes at a higher cost due to the use of rarer and more expensive materials like nickel and cobalt, which constitute about 70% of a battery's cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Their higher energy densities also increase thermal risks, potentially leading to thermal runaway or fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

2.  **Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) Batteries**: These batteries utilize a dual-chemistry cathode made from iron phosphate, notably containing no cobalt or nickel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Since iron and phosphorus are more common materials, LFPs possess a substantial cost advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. They also maintain their initial energy capacity better after numerous charge and discharge cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

    The primary drawback of LFPs is their lower energy density, typically ranging from 90 to 160 watt-hours per kilogram, which means LFP-powered EVs generally have shorter ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, this lower energy density also reduces the risks of thermal runaway, making them safer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

In a broad generalization, batteries balance three aspects: performance, cost, and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. LFPs excel in cost and safety but fall short in performance, while NMC and NCA chemistries offer performance but at a higher cost and increased safety risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Historical Development and Market Shifts

Early lithium-ion batteries, such as Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCOs), relied heavily on cobalt (0.95 kg per kilogram-hour of energy capacity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The unsustainable economic, moral, and environmental implications of sourcing so much cobalt, primarily from the Democratic Republic of Congo, led to the adoption of ternary chemistries like NCA, NMC, and Lithium Manganese Oxide (LMO), which used significantly less cobalt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Western EVs like the Chevrolet Volt, Nissan Leaf, and Tesla Model S in the 2010s primarily used ternary cathode chemistries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

In contrast, early EV makers in China adopted LFPs for their new energy vehicles, particularly buses, influenced by government policies like the "Thousands of Vehicles, Tens of Cities" (TVTC) policy launched in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This policy provided subsidies to municipal governments to purchase public service fleets, aiming to address urban air pollution, energy security, and foster Chinese EV development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Companies like BYD pioneered LFP use due to cost and safety benefits, leading to LFP dominance in the Chinese EV industry for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

However, in late 2016, Chinese government subsidy policies shifted to incentivize EVs with higher energy density, longer ranges, faster charging, and fuel savings, aiming for more consumer-attractive cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This favored ternary battery chemistries, which could access larger subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. By mid-2019, ternary batteries accounted for approximately 70% of installed capacity in China, while LFP's market share dropped to 30% or lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### The Subsidies Withdraw and LFP Revitalization

A major turning point occurred in June 2019 when the Chinese government announced the gradual withdrawal of EV cash subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This aggressive sunsetting of subsidies leveled the cost playing field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. EV makers quickly reverted to LFP, coinciding with significant technological advancements in LFP manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## [[technological_innovations_in_lfp_battery_production | Technological Innovations in LFP Battery Production]]

A key innovation that revitalized LFP was the **BYD Blade battery**, introduced in March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Traditional EV battery manufacturing involves three levels: cells, modules, and packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The Blade battery, using a "Cell-to-Pack" (CTP) approach, eliminates the module level, directly integrating cells into the battery pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This design maximizes the pack's volume, compensating for LFP's lower inherent energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

BYD re-engineered the prismatic cell (a long, flat pouch in a rigid metal casing) into a very long, ultra-thin "blade" shape, spanning the width of the entire battery pack, which also provides structural integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This innovation allowed the 2020 Han EV, using LFP, to achieve a range of 605 kilometers (NEDC), comparable to premium ternary-battery EVs but at a significantly lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. CTP technology gives LFP battery packs about 85% of the energy density of conventional NMC batteries, and ternary batteries struggle to adopt CTP due to their higher operating temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Other Chinese battery makers, like CATL, subsequently adopted similar CTP technologies, such as their Qilin battery pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

By 2021, LFP battery volumes surpassed NMC, and by 2023, LFPs accounted for nearly 70% of EV installations in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. NMC batteries are now primarily reserved for premium, high-performance vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Further [[technological_innovations_in_lfp_battery_production | technological innovations in LFP battery production]] include:
*   **LMFP (Lithium Manganese Iron Phosphate)**: Adding manganese to LFP increases its energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **"Double firing" (二烧) process flow**: This involves partially firing cathode precursors at a lower temperature, then milling and carbon coating the particles before a second firing. This results in more uniform, similarly sized particles with better conductivity, leading to improved, consistent performance for long-range and fast-charging EVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

### Patent Expiry and Market Competition

Early LFP patents, pioneered by Dr. John Goodenough (who also discovered the fundamental lithium-ion battery structure), faced commercial challenges due to poor electrical conductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Key innovations in carbon coating and process technologies, patented by Canadian and European researchers, made LFP commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. These patents were consolidated and licensed globally, but an agreement in the 2000s or 2010s allowed Chinese battery makers to use LFP patents for free within their local markets, while others had to pay license fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This "patent shield" enabled China to develop extensive LFP proficiency, leaving other global manufacturers to pursue non-LFP chemistries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

When these patents expired in 2022, foreign battery makers could access LFP chemistry without licensing fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. However, Chinese battery makers had already built immense LFP supply chain proficiency, including CTP innovations, massive economies of scale, and advanced materials sourcing, placing them at a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

The market has become even more competitive. BYD, which historically integrated its batteries solely into its own cars, began selling its Blade batteries to third parties like Toyota and Ford in 2021, initiating a price war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

## Raw Material Availability and Costs

A major contributor to the recent lithium-ion battery price crash was the concurrent decline in raw material prices after 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Raw materials account for 70-80% of a battery cell's cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, and for LFP, 80% of that material cost is attributed to iron phosphate and lithium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

In 2023, new lithium sources came online in Australia, Chile, and Argentina, reversing a prior lithium shortage and causing prices to crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Iron ore prices also fell from their 2022 highs due to China's real estate crisis, which idled crude steel production, leading to a 15% drop in iron ore prices in 2024 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. These [[trends_in_global_battery_material_prices_and_their_effects_on_the_market | trends in global battery material prices and their effects on the market]] allow Chinese EV battery makers to cut battery prices while maintaining profitability amidst intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

## Commercialization and Applications Beyond EVs

The plummeting prices of LFP batteries have had significant spillover effects beyond EVs, particularly in utility-scale stationary energy storage systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. These systems store excess power from wind or solar during low demand, releasing it during peak hours as a cost-effective alternative to ramping up fossil fuel plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

While methods like pumped storage or "power to gas" exist, the crashing costs of LFP batteries have made Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) highly competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. LFPs were already favored for BESS due to their lower material costs and resistance to thermal runaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. The Chinese EV boom in 2021 further fueled BESS adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

Though BESS currently offer less power duration (1-2 hours) compared to pumped storage (4-12 hours), they are incredibly cheap and simple to build, often housed in standard-sized containers for easy deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. Billions of dollars are being invested in BESS projects across the United States, particularly in California and Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

## Future Outlook

While LFP prices are expected to continue falling, the rate of decline may slow compared to previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. An interesting development to watch is the progress of [[introduction_to_catls_sodiumion_battery | sodium ion]] battery technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. Companies like CATL, BYD, and Huawei are pursuing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

[[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | Sodium ion]] batteries inherently suffer from lower energy densities compared to lithium ion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. However, sodium is far more abundant than lithium, and sodium ion batteries show promise for faster charging, with improving energy density figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. Given the highly optimized LFP supply chain, it remains to be seen if [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium ion battery technology]] will achieve a similar market impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

[[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Seymour Cray]], a computer designer, once famously articulated his ambition when asked about his five-year and one-year goals:
> Five-year goal: Build the biggest computer in the world. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
> One-year goal: One-fifth of the above. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>

This singular focus defined his career, as he "literally only wanted one thing: To take it to the limit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> in making the biggest supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Beginnings and Early Career

Born in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin in 1925, [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Seymour Cray]] Jr. inherited a love for science and engineering from his civil engineer father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. He showed an early aptitude for chemistry, electrician work, and radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. After serving as an army electrician, Cray earned degrees in electrical engineering and applied math from the University of Minnesota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

In 1950, he joined Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in St. Paul, Minnesota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. ERA was founded after World War II to retain elite Navy code-breakers, transitioning from secret code-breaking machines to general-purpose computers, leveraging [[challenges_and_breakthroughs_in_early_semiconductor_research | emerging technologies like magnetic drum memory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Minnesota became an early computing hub due to a strong military presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Working with Cray

Despite being just 25, Cray quickly proved to be a talented and brilliant worker with incredible focus and rigid discipline, possessing a gift for binary numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. He was tasked with producing the control system for ERA's 1103 computer, which required deep knowledge of the machine's architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

Like [[legacy_and_impact_of_an_wang_and_wang_labs | An Wang of Wang Labs]], Cray's genius could make him difficult to work for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. He preferred working alone, often late into the evening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. If someone was not performing to his standards, he would reassign them and complete the work himself, a practice colleagues called "being scrayed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Despite this, he was generally liked and respected, seen as eccentric but brilliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Corporate Tensions and the Birth of Control Data

In December 1951, ERA was sold to Remington Rand, a move that angered key employees like William Norris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Remington Rand had also acquired Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation, makers of ENIAC and UNIVAC I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. While Eckert–Mauchly focused on business computers, ERA was to focus on scientific computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

Internal tensions flared due to differing philosophies: business computers focused on large-scale simple operations, while scientific computers required complex, highly accurate calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The Eckert–Mauchly team viewed ERA as "farmers," while ERA saw the Philadelphians as theoreticians obsessed with speed at the cost of reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

The situation worsened when Rand merged with Sperry Corporation in 1955 to form Sperry Rand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. William Norris, sensing that Sperry Rand lacked the capital to properly fund computer R&D and leasing, left in 1957 to found Control Data Corporation (CDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Seymour Cray]] joined him, having observed his own project categorized as "999 Miscellaneous and Other" at Sperry Rand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

CDC started with little more than employees and a vague idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. They raised capital through a unique IPO, selling shares for a dollar each on the street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, a move many prominent investors, including Warren Buffett, declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. These shares later created significant wealth in Minnesota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## The Supercomputer Vision at Control Data

[[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]], as the most technical person at CDC, persuaded co-founders to focus on scientific computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. His rationale was that customers like universities and nuclear weapons labs prioritized raw compute power over marketing or client service, and often programmed their own software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. These customers needed machines capable of simulating complex phenomena like nuclear detonations, demanding the biggest and fastest computers available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### The CDC 1604

Cray believed he could build such a computer cost-effectively using transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. He even leveraged reject bipolar transistors by pairing them in a Darlington pair to amplify their weak signals, teaching him that "with the right design, you can use substandard components and still achieve the goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

In 1958, CDC secured a deal with the US Navy for the CDC 1604 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Released in 1960, the 1604 was priced at $990,000 (about $10.4 million today) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. At 0.2 megahertz, it was the most powerful commercially-available computer of its time, establishing CDC as a player in supercomputing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

While other companies like UNIVAC and IBM also produced powerful machines (LARC, IBM 7030 STRETCH), these were often made-to-order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Control Data turned the supercomputer into a commercially successful category, selling the 1604 to various universities and government entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### The CDC 6600: Pushing Boundaries

After the 1604, Cray insisted on building the fastest possible machine, threatening to leave if CDC focused solely on the commercial market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This led to a split, with Cray and his team establishing a lab in his hometown of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, to work on the 6600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

For the CDC 6600, [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]] made several critical design changes:
*   **Transistors**: He sourced [[challenges_and_breakthroughs_in_early_semiconductor_research | silicon planar transistors]] from Fairchild, gaining a 5x speed boost over germanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.
*   **Packaging**: He abandoned extensive back panel wiring in favor of denser "cordwood modules," which shortened wires for improved speed but required freon gas cooling and made repairs difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   **Parallelism**: The 6600 featured 11 individual computers sharing central memory, allowing 10 peripheral processors to handle "housekeeping" tasks and freeing the main processor for high-speed math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Simplicity**: The instruction set architecture (ISA) was simplified, ditching features unrelated to scientific computing (e.g., data handling for commercial users) to enable "pipelining" tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

The CDC 6600, delivered in 1964, was three times faster than IBM's 7030, shocking IBM Chairman Thomas J. Watson Jr., who questioned how "34 people - including the janitor" beat the biggest tech company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. The answer lay in IBM's unwillingness to sacrifice compatibility for speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

## Challenges at Control Data and Departure

Despite the 6600's success, discontent festered at CDC. Management increasingly focused on peripherals, software, and even purchasing a consumer finance company (Commercial Credit) to fund computer leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. While over a hundred 6600s were sold at $8 million each (about $23 million today) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>, limiting the market to about 50 customers worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>, Cray saw this as a feature, not a bug, loving to know his customers by first name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

The CDC 7600, Cray's next machine, was five times faster than the 6600 but sold poorly due to frequent breakdowns and a weak economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. His subsequent project, the 8600, aimed for an 8-nanosecond clock cycle, requiring parts to be squeezed incredibly close (wires shorter than 2.5 meters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. Cray struggled with cooling this dense design, eventually deciding to scrap it and start over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.

This "Cray way" of starting from scratch clashed with CDC's financial realities, especially during an expensive antitrust lawsuit against IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. When asked to cut expenses, Cray cut his own salary to minimum wage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. However, Norris stated a redo was impossible due to pre-sold 8600 systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. In 1972, Cray left to found [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

## [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research]] and the Cray-1

[[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Seymour Cray]] founded [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research]] with $2.5 million, aiming to build the biggest computer "one at a time like a master artisan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. The focus was on research rather than mass manufacture, "plumbing the outer limits of possibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. William Norris and CDC even invested "heart money" in the new venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

### Technical Breakthroughs of the Cray-1

For the Cray-1, Cray introduced **Vector Processing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Unlike scalar processing that handles single data items, vector processing handles arrays of data (vectors) simultaneously, drastically reducing instruction count for repetitive operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

Cray studied CDC's failed STAR-100 vector computer and identified its flaws: slow scalar processing and inefficient vector loading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. He solved the latter by introducing "vector registers" – very fast intermediate memory systems that acted like cache memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

He also adopted [[challenges_and_breakthroughs_in_early_semiconductor_research | integrated circuits]] for the first time, increasing density and cutting down on wiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. This reflected his principle of choosing "a decade behind" older technologies for reliability, though he broke this for new [[challenges_and_breakthroughs_in_early_semiconductor_research | bipolar semiconductor memory chips]] for cost, density, and power benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. The Cray-1's 12.5-nanosecond clock cycle meant every wire had to be less than four feet long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

Released in 1976, the Cray-1, with its iconic circular shape and cushions, generated immense excitement due to its flashy look and world-beating speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. It sold over a hundred units to government and university labs, leading to massive revenue growth for [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research]] and effectively sidelining Control Data from the supercomputing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.

## New Pressures and Challenges

The success of the Cray-1, which was hand-wired and custom-made, brought new challenges: the company had to staff up significantly to meet backlog demands, growing from 300 to 5,000 employees by its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.

Cray's original premise of scientific users writing their own software changed. Customers now demanded portability, preferring a better Cray-1 over a radically different Cray-2 that would require extensive software rewrites – a dilemma reminiscent of his time at Control Data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. [[the_challenges_and_demise_of_the_multics_project | Unix operating system]]'s popularity underscored this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

[[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research]] again adopted a dual approach: extending the Cray-1 line with the 1S, while [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Seymour Cray]] stepped down as Chairman in 1981 to become an independent contractor, moving to Boulder, Colorado, to focus solely on the ambitious Cray-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

### The Cray X-MP and Shifting Paradigms

The Cray-2, released in 1985, featured a massive liquid immersion cooling system but underperformed due to memory latency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. To many's surprise, it was upstaged by the Cray X-MP, developed by a separate team led by Les Davis and Steve Chen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. The X-MP introduced parallel processing with four CPUs and solid-state storage, becoming the world's fastest supercomputer in 1983 without the radical redesigns of the Cray-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. The X-MP and its successor, the Y-MP, sold almost 200 units compared to only 24 Cray-2s by 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

The 1980s saw the emergence of new competitors:
*   **Japanese manufacturers**: Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC leveraged advantages in VLSI semiconductor production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
*   **Supercomputer startups**: Thinking Machines and nCUBE explored Massively Parallel Systems (MPPs), coordinating many commercial microprocessors for better price-performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>.

These pressures forced [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research]] to reassess its product lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.

### Cray Leaves Cray and Final Endeavors

Steve Chen's ambitious vision for the MP line after the Y-MP, including 64 processors and optical interconnects, spiraled beyond [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research]]'s financial capacity, already strained by existing projects including Cray's own Cray-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. In 1987, the company scaled back the MP line, leading Chen to quit and found Supercomputer Systems, which later went bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

In 1989, [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Seymour Cray]] joined a spinoff called Cray Computer Corporation (CCC) in Colorado to work on the Cray-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. The Cray-3 aimed to use gallium arsenide semiconductors for faster switching performance, requiring significant chipmaking investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. However, it fell behind, and customer cancellations due to decreased defense demand after the fall of the Soviet Union led CCC to file for bankruptcy in 1995 after selling only one system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. His cherished approach of "sitting down with a clean sheet of paper" and building "big iron" supercomputers was no longer financially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.

[[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Seymour Cray]] formed SRC Computers to explore parallel designs but passed away in 1996 at 71 due to a car accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research]] was eventually acquired by Silicon Graphics and is now part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as Cray Inc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.

## Conclusion and Legacy

While modern semiconductor technologies have made Cray's early supercomputers seem comically slow – for instance, a 2010 project emulated the Cray-1A using an [[early_challenges_and_developments_in_fpga_technology | Xilinx Spartan-3E 1600 development board]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a> – his legacy endures.

The challenges [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Seymour Cray]] faced in balancing cutting-edge performance with manufacturability, dealing with thermal problems, interconnect issues, and memory retrieval slowdowns, are strikingly similar to those faced by today's leading-edge semiconductor makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>. Unlike Cray, however, the modern semiconductor industry cannot simply "throw it all out, and start anew with a fresh sheet of paper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>. His career highlights the enduring quest for computational speed and the complex trade-offs involved in pushing technological limits.

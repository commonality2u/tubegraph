## The Unconventional Economics of Diamonds

Historically, [[history_of_diamond_pricing_and_market_manipulation | diamond prices]] have had little relation to their extraction cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While a diamond at a jewelry shop might cost around $550 per carat, or up to $20,000 per carat for high-class diamonds, their mining cost is closer to $58-$60 per carat, a figure that has remained stable for 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This high price is primarily due to various supply cartels throughout history, which manage supply to maintain steady prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Historical Market Control

Diamond overpricing is not a new phenomenon; market entities have controlled supply for centuries to manipulate prices upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Even in antiquity, when Indian kings dominated production, prices far exceeded extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. For instance, in the 1500s, a half-carat diamond cost the equivalent of 30,000 days of an average laborer's wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. When Portuguese discoveries in Brazil led to a flood of new diamonds in 1725, prices plummeted by 30-50% until the Portuguese Crown took control and limited supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### The Rise of De Beers

The most renowned supply cartel was De Beers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The discovery of the 21.8-carat Eureka diamond in South Africa in 1866 sparked a mining rush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Production soared from 100,000 carats in 1870 to 3 million carats in 1880 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Cecil Rhodes established the De Beers Mining Company, which distinguished itself by mining diamonds more efficiently and reducing labor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The company housed migrant workers, who were often prisoners, in closed compounds to maintain productivity, selling them food and clothes at cost, and strictly controlling drunkenness and brawling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This "investment" reduced labor costs from 36% in 1883 to 26% in 1887, providing financial strength to acquire competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. By 1888, Rhodes and De Beers had consolidated the South African diamond mining industry and limited production to stabilize prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### The Central Selling Organization (CSO)

After Rhodes's death, Ernst Oppenheimer, founder of Anglo-American, became chairman of De Beers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Under his leadership, De Beers formed agreements with other producers to sell all their raw production to the Central Selling Organization (CSO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

The CSO bought diamonds at a fixed, profit-guaranteeing price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. It then resold them in "sites"—ten annual sales events—to jewelry cutting factories, known as "site holders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Site holders would tell the CSO their needs, and on the day of the site, they received a box of diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. They were not allowed to negotiate, had to take the whole box, pay the full price, and could not resell any rough diamonds; failure to comply resulted in expulsion from the cabal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### The Power of Marketing: "A Diamond Is Forever"

The CSO also controlled the industry's marketing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In 1938, Harry Oppenheimer, Ernest's son, collaborated with N.W. Ayer of New York to create a marketing campaign linking diamonds with romance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This campaign used influencer and content marketing, along with smart advertising, to build the diamond brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Movie stars wore diamonds, news articles were planted about celebrities acquiring fine diamonds, and the iconic 1949 slogan "A diamond is forever" was introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This campaign successfully established diamonds as the pinnacle of luxury and a wedding fixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## The Challenge of Synthetic Diamonds

For centuries, people attempted to create their own diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. In 1797, Smithson Tennant showed diamonds were a form of carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Early attempts to synthesize diamonds involved subjecting carbon to high pressure and heat, but claims of success by scientists like James Hannay and Ferdinand Frederick Henri Moissan in the late 1800s could not be replicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The technology of their era was insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Scientific Breakthroughs

A significant breakthrough came in 1915 when Gilbert Lewis and Merle Randall demonstrated that at 10,000 atmospheres, diamond and graphite were in equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This allowed scientists to map the conditions (temperature and pressure) under which carbon forms diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. It was determined that manifesting carbon as diamond requires not only 2000 degrees Celsius but also over a million pounds per square inch of pressure, or less if a metal catalyst is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This provided a roadmap for [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds | diamond synthesis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Early Synthetic Diamond Production

In February 1953, researchers at ASEA (General Swedish Electrical Limited Company) produced the first [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds | synthetic diamond]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. They used a device with six anvils applying hydraulic force to a core containing graphite, heated by ignited thermite to 2000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The addition of an iron solvent and a mixture of cementite and graphite within the core led to the discovery of small diamond crystals (0.1 mm across) under conditions of 80,000 bar (1.2 million psi) and 2000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. ASEA did not immediately publicize or patent their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

In 1951, General Electric (GE) formed a group to produce [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds | synthetic diamonds]] due to supply chain concerns, as GE was then the world's largest consumer of industrial diamonds, using 20 tons of diamond grit annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Collaborating with physicist P.W. Bridgman, GE modified one of his designs to create a "belt apparatus" capable of exerting three million pounds per square inch at 3400 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. At these extreme conditions, graphite or other carbon forms could directly transition into diamond, producing small crystals about one millimeter wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

The news of GE's success temporarily threatened the public's perception of natural diamonds' uniqueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. However, since these synthetic diamonds were very small, they posed no immediate threat to De Beers, which dealt in larger stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. While larger diamonds (up to three carats) could be grown using a seed diamond and precise control, they were often dark-colored and of low quality, unsuitable for jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

By 1970, scientists could create large, gem-quality crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The secret was time; a one-carat diamond took about a week to grow, making it economically infeasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. These crystals were also usually yellow and easily distinguishable from natural diamonds using UV fluorescence or absorption spectroscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | Chemical Vapor Deposition]] (CVD)

Researchers explored growing diamonds in a low-pressure environment without expensive equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. From 1952-1953, William Eversole of Union Carbide heated a carbon-containing gas in the presence of a seed diamond, allowing carbon atoms to attach and grow the diamond's mass without high pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This method, known as [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), is heavily used in the [[role_of_eda_in_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

Eversole's work was largely forgotten until 1963, when Dr. John Angus of Case Western Reserve University replicated and continued it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The key to growing pure, gem-quality diamonds with [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | CVD]] was atomic hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Initially, Angus's team used alternating growth and cleaning cycles (using sulfuric acid to etch off unwanted graphite) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. A PhD student suggested using an atomic hydrogen stream from a Tungsten filament for cleaning, which allowed both growth and cleaning in the same chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

In 1971, Angus mentioned his use of atomic hydrogen at a Soviet academic meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. A Soviet team pioneered using atomic hydrogen during both the cleaning and growth phases, which suppressed graphite formation and turned any formed graphite into gas, removing it from the diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. In the 1980s, a Japanese team at the National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials further accelerated growth using a hot filament or microwaves to activate a mix of hydrogen and methane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

By the 1990s, the [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | CVD]] industry could make single-crystal [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds | synthetic diamonds]] in various colors, and these gem-quality synthetics began appearing in the jewelry market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

## De Beers' Adaptation in a Changing Market

In the 1990s, De Beers responded to [[impact_of_synthetic_diamonds_on_the_jewelry_market | synthetic diamonds]] by investing in new detection methods, including UV fluorescence, X-rays, and advanced spectroscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. While this initially worked, synthetics rapidly eliminated this weakness, becoming identifiable only with very advanced lab tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

During the 1990s, De Beers and the broader diamond industry faced massive changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Japan's rise as a luxury jewelry market in the late 1980s boosted the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. However, the fall of the Soviet Union and new deposits in Australia (like BHP's Argyle mine) introduced new competitors, breaking apart the old cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. Former De Beers customer Lev Leviev purchased diamond factories and struck agreements with Russia's new monopoly, Al Rosa, establishing an independent competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

By the turn of the century, De Beers, while retaining formidable market share, acknowledged it no longer controlled the entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. In 2000, De Beers restructured into a more traditional luxury company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. They shifted marketing to promote De Beers-affiliated dealers and partnered with Louis Vuitton for branded retail ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

In a significant shift, De Beers announced in 2020 that it would begin producing and selling its own [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds | synthetic diamonds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This move reflects an attempt to leverage the technological advances of the [[impact_of_synthetic_diamonds_on_the_jewelry_market | synthetic diamond]] industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

This transition mirrors the pearl market, where natural pearls were replaced by cultured pearls pioneered by Japan in the 1910s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Consumers preferred cultured pearls for their rounder, better look and environmental benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Today, virtually all pearls in jewelry shops are cultured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

Similarly, modern gem-quality [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | CVD synthetic diamonds]] are becoming more beautiful, aesthetically ideal, environmentally friendly, and produced at a lower cost than natural diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. While [[impact_of_synthetic_diamonds_on_the_jewelry_market | synthetic diamonds]] are indeed disrupting the market, the value is shifting from the scarcity of the stone to the scarcity of the De Beers luxury brand, much like with a Louis Vuitton product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

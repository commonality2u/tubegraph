[[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han ethnic supremacy]] is an emerging point of concern on China's internet and cultural backwaters, with views expressed by real people that should not be dismissed as mere "crazies chattering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Defining "Han" and Supremacist Views

The definition of "Han" is a complex question, similar to defining "white" in America, which has changed over time to include groups like Italians, Irish, and Jewish people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. To be Han is not about a distinct nationality, ethnicity, or race, but rather a constructed bundle of items like Confucian values and certain rites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It's often described as an "I know it when I see it" concept, with the existence of groups like the Hakka and Cantonese providing proof of its fluid nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

In contrast, [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacists]] simplify this nuance, viewing "Han-ness" as a single, mono-race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. They state, "Han people are the core race in China. The interests of the Han race are one in one with those of China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. They describe the Han as having five thousand years of direct racial inheritance, with their blood being among the purest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Genetic Reality
> In reality, Han people are genetically a deeply intermixed group, having migrated and mixed for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. China has also been ruled longer by foreigners than by Han people over the past 1000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Historical Context of Han Nationalism and State Policy

[[historical_context_of_han_supremacy_in_china | Han nationalism]] played a role in toppling the Qing Dynasty and establishing both the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Centuries of ethnic minority rule by the Manchu people created resentment among the Han majority, with elites railing against "furry and horned Manchu people" to unite the "pure Han race" against enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

However, Sun Yat-sen, upon the ROC's ascent to power, recognized that continued [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacy]] could divide the country, especially as other multi-ethnic empires like Russia and Austria-Hungary were splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. He and other Kuomintang founders promoted racial harmony as a core tenet, symbolized by the five-colored flag and the principle of "five races under one union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The ROC also sometimes advocated for a single unified Chinese race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

Despite these efforts, [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han ethnocentrism]] remained a lingering issue for governance and the suppression of ethnic minorities, becoming a major social problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### The Communist Party's Approach to Ethnic Minorities

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) garnered support from China's ethnic minorities who were disillusioned with their standing in the Republic of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Mao Zedong strongly valued China's ethnic minorities, stating in April 1956 that "reactionary rulers chiefly from the Han nationality sowed feelings of estrangement among our various nationalities and bullied the minority peoples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. He emphasized extensive education in "proletarian nationality policy" and frequent reviews of the relationship between Han and minority nationalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

The PRC has consistently prioritized [[government_policies_and_ethnic_minority_dynamics_in_china | ethnic minority]] and racial harmony, driven by both ideological and practical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Although not known for gender equality, the CCP has effectively promoted high-performing cadres from ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. In the 1950s, the CCP itself helped create and codify China's ethnic minorities, sending teams to locate, classify, and protect non-Han cultures, resulting in the recognition of 56 separate nationalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Affirmative Action Policies

The People's Congress crafted a series of affirmative action policies and preferential treatments to help China's minorities achieve parity with the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. These benefits include:
*   Regional ethnic autonomous states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
*   Dedicated museums, parks, schools, and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
*   Preferential treatment in China's national testing exam (gaokao), where minorities in western China might need 200 points compared to Han people's 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>
*   An exception to the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>

> [!NOTE]
> Some of these policies are also reflected in Taiwan, where recognized aboriginal tribes receive similar benefits in their college exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

These policies were introduced due to significant existing gaps in income, wealth, and employment between ethnic minorities and the Han majority, similar to disparities between white and black Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Han Resentment and Cultural Movements

While intended to close gaps, these [[government_policies_and_ethnic_minority_dynamics_in_china | policies]] have largely cultivated resentment from the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Han people perceive themselves as the crucial drivers of the Chinese nation and its history, yet feel they are not treated the same as ethnic minorities, and are even seen as part of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Such views have gained traction on the Chinese internet, leading to the emergence of dozens of [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han culture forums and websites]] in China, Taiwan, and the overseas Chinese diaspora, such as the now-closed "Han Net" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. These groups advocate for the revitalization of certain aspects of Han culture while rejecting others based on their non-Han origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### The Hanfu Movement

An example is the criticism of China encouraging the wearing of Qing-era clothing like the Manchu *chi pao* or *makwa* (horse jacket) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Instead, these groups advocated for the *han fu* clothing worn before what they called "alien rule" (the Manchu conquest of the Ming Dynasty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The *han fu* movement went mainstream because the clothes were perceived as "cute," initially appealing to people connecting with their culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. However, the *han fu* movement and similar sites promoting Han culture eventually served as a "gateway drug" for harder versions of [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

## Historical Revisionism and its Consequences

[[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han ethnocentrists]] hold a special dislike for the Manchu people, vigorously revising views of the Qing and Yuan dynasties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. They portray the Qing Dynasty and its Manchu leaders as bloodthirsty, claiming they:
*   Rolled back the Ming Dynasty's progressive advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>
*   Stole Han people's wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>
*   Butchered Han people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>
*   Made China a "backwards country," allowing the West to advance and invade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
They equate the Manchu to colonists, similar to the British in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This narrative "hijacks history" by simplifying the complex Qing conquest of the Ming Dynasty, which involved Han people fighting against Han people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This historical revisionism aims to reject the celebration of 300 years of Chinese history and blame its decline on a "foreign face," absolving the Han of any responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

### Grievances Against Affirmative Action

The CCP's [[government_policies_and_ethnic_minority_dynamics_in_china | affirmative action policies]] receive legitimate criticism online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Han netizens perceive a quiet deal: minorities receive special privileges in exchange for not seeking independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The most contentious policies are the national examination thresholds and the exemption from the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

The one-child policy exemption has increased the proportion of ethnic minorities in China from 3% in 1949 to 8% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. To [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacists]], this signifies the Han people "conducting their own self-destruction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Coupled with easier exam thresholds, a perception persists that there are "more ethnic minorities running around and they are dumber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Incidents of ethnic violence, like the late 2000s riots in Urumqi, also fuel anti-minority sentiment, with complaints that authorities protect minorities in the name of national unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## Parallels and Government Response

The challenges faced by China's [[government_policies_and_ethnic_minority_dynamics_in_china | government policies and ethnic minority dynamics]] parallel those in the United States, where a nation founded on inclusive ideals struggled with racial realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Just as America has mainstream efforts to be more inclusive alongside darker schools of thought advocating for Christian or white ethnocentrism, China faces a similar spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

China has schools of thought advocating inclusiveness, where one can be accepted into Chinese society or even the Han race by practicing Confucian values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Conversely, a darker school of thought advocates for an "inherent gap between the Han people and the barbarians," believing other races are "born barbarians" and assimilation is a "fool's errand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

[[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacist]] sites are widespread, existing in America, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, and other Chinese diaspora locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The problem is most troubling in areas with significant Han majorities and substantial minority populations, like China and Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

The Chinese government has attempted to manage these concerns and foster cross-ethnic unity by creating a feeling of "us (China) versus them (the West)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. By portraying all Westerners as foreigners and encouraging an acceptable level of anti-foreign sentiment, they aim to suppress [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. While this tactic might work, its long-term health is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

The speaker suggests that government officials, being Han themselves, might be "seduced" by the creed of being part of a supreme race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

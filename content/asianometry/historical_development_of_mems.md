[[introduction_to_mems_technology_and_its_applications | Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)]] are microsystems that combine both electrical and mechanical functions, fabricated using advanced techniques similar to those for integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. These tiny devices, often smaller than a penny and made entirely of silicon, are pervasive in modern life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Despite the "miraculous" nature of the technology, the [[economic_challenges_in_the_mems_industry | MEMS industry]] has consistently faced significant economic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

## Early Visions of Miniaturization

The concept of making things incredibly small has long fascinated scientists. In 1959, Richard Feynman delivered a lecture at Caltech titled "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. In this lecture, he envisioned the direct manipulation of individual atoms to create useful tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Feynman offered a \$1,000 prize for the creation of a tiny motor, able to fit within a 0.4-millimeter cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This prize was claimed less than a year later by a Caltech engineer, though the motor was built using conventional tools, not the atomic manipulation Feynman had in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

## The First Movable Transistor

The spirit of Feynman's challenge was met in 1967 when Harvey Nathanson at Westinghouse developed a new type of transistor, the resonant gate transistor, using pre-modern micro-machining techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This gold transistor, approximately one millimeter long, was notable for its ability to move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Researchers could control the distance between its gate and electrode using electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Its response to a narrow range of input signals made it useful as a frequency filter, marking it as the first true MEMS product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Commercial Breakthroughs

### Inkjet Nozzles

[[design_and_production_techniques_for_mems | MEMS technology]] achieved widespread commercial success in 1979 when Hewlett-Packard (HP) utilized silicon micro-machining to develop printer inkjet nozzles, enabling thermal inkjet technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. These nozzles became one of the most successful applications of the technology up to that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

Thermal inkjet technology operates by rapidly heating ink to approximately 100 degrees Celsius, creating tiny bubbles that push ink through a micro-machined nozzle onto paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. When these bubbles collapse, they create a vacuum, drawing in more ink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. While the nozzles themselves are not mechanical in the sense of moving parts, MEMS technology facilitated their creation and allowed HP to integrate many of them, boosting printer resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

### Sensors (1990s Onward)

The 1990s brought another significant commercial application for the [[introduction_to_mems_technology_and_its_applications | MEMS industry]]: sensors for acceleration, pressure, and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. These sensors found utility across industrial, medical, and electronics sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

#### Automotive Airbag Sensors

One of the earliest and most impactful sensor applications was the automotive airbag sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Original airbag sensors were large, heavy, complex mechanical devices (balls in a tube), costing hundreds of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. In 1991, Analog Devices introduced the first commercial acceleration MEMS sensor, the ADXL50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

The ADXL50, less than one square centimeter, incorporated capacitive sense fingers (about 60 microns deep) attached to a movable mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. When acceleration occurs, the mass moves, changing the capacitive value of the fingers, which is then sensed and relayed to the car's electronic control unit (ECU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Analog Devices integrated the accelerometer and its electronics onto a single silicon chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. This monolithic system was smaller, more reliable, and drastically cheaper (about \$5, compared to \$20-100 for older systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. These sensors greatly contributed to the widespread adoption of airbags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. Modern cars now incorporate dozens of MEMS-based sensors for features like anti-lock brakes, active suspension, and rollover detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. Over 60 million MEMS-based airbag sensors alone have been sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

#### Medical Pressure Sensors

Pressure sensors became another significant MEMS application, particularly in hospitals for monitoring blood pressure via intravenous lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. Early external sensors cost over \$600 and required sterilization and recalibration for each reuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. The MEMS version, costing only about \$10 (with packaging being the majority of the cost), was disposable and far simpler to use in medical settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

Mechanically, these sensors are straightforward: silicon is crafted into a thin membrane acting as a diaphragm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. Four small, stress-sensitive polysilicon resistors (piezoresistors) are placed along the diaphragm's edges, suspended over a vacuum cavity to form an absolute pressure sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. When pressure changes, it alters the silicon band structure and the crystal's resistivity, which is then sensed and relayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. Today, the medical MEMS-based sensor industry is valued at over \$6 billion, with blood pressure sensors being the largest component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

#### Consumer Electronics

Manufacturers expanded upon early pressure and accelerometer designs to create a variety of versatile, low-power inertial MEMS-based sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. These are now integrated into many consumer electronics, such as the Nintendo Switch, which uses ultra-low power inertial sensors with gyroscope and accelerometer capabilities (e.g., STMicroelectronics SH-627) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. MEMS micro-machining technologies also appear in visual displays and optical switches, where micro-mirrors redirect light between optical fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

## Production and Economic Challenges

The common approach for [[design_and_production_techniques_for_mems | commercial MEMS production]] involves using high-volume IC techniques like photolithography and etching to build 3D shapes from 2D substrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. However, there is no universal methodology, leading companies to explore other economical machining methods such as electrochemical micro-machining, laser beam machining, and electrode discharge machining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

Despite these advancements, the [[economic_challenges_in_the_mems_industry | MEMS industry]] faces hurdles beyond large-scale fabrication, particularly in design and back-end steps (testing and packaging) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

### Design Differences

While sharing similarities with integrated circuits (ICs), MEMS design has fundamental differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. Miniaturization introduces new considerations; for instance, friction forces are significantly stronger than inertia at the micro scale, and tiny flow spaces are prone to blockages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. Conversely, some biochips can utilize electro-osmotic effects at the micrometer scale to pump reactants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

Unlike VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) in semiconductor design, which benefits from modular approaches and standardized cell libraries, mechanical design lacks such standardized components (apart from basic fasteners) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Mechanical components must be custom-tailored to specific weight, space, and energy restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. While VLSI objects primarily process signals, mechanical objects must often contain liquids, rotate, slide, or support loads, making MEMS design highly customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. Despite this, companies like CoventorWare and IntelliCAD are developing CAD and design automation software for the MEMS industry to help designers understand micro-structure design and electromechanical behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

### Packaging and Pricing

Testing and packaging, the "back end" of the semiconductor process, are critical for MEMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. For MEMS-based sensors, 75% to 80% of the final cost comes from packaging, a stark reversal from integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. For example, a raw MEMS pressure sensor die might cost less than 50 cents, but its packaged counterpart for the HVAC market could be \$20-30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.

This cost disparity stems from a fundamental difference: an IC is a self-contained system, with packaging serving a secondary role for protection and external interfacing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. A MEMS device, however, must intimately interact with the outside world (e.g., a pressure sensor cannot be sealed in a plastic case) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>. This requires custom packaging for each MEMS die based on its specific function, adding substantial engineering and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>.

Analog Devices, an early investor in MEMS for airbag sensors in the 1980s, faced this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. They built an in-house manufacturing facility, but it took nine years to become profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. Analog Devices had to accept automatic price declines (e.g., from \$11 to \$6 per unit over six years) in their initial deals, hoping for production efficiencies similar to the IC industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. Yield is a major cost factor: doubling yield halves the cost, but achieving this is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. This difficulty leads to overly optimistic projections and market prices that do not reflect the full investment required for development, production, packaging, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. Relentless market price erosion (3-5% quarterly) erodes margins and disincentivizes investment in new [[the_future_and_potential_of_the_mems_industry | MEMS possibilities]], such as micro-propulsion for cube satellites, LiDAR mirrors for autonomous cars, or IoT sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite its "magical" ability to create microscopic moving parts that perform like much larger objects, offering smaller, cheaper, and better solutions, the [[introduction_to_mems_technology_and_its_applications | MEMS industry]] has been a victim of its own success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. Its creativity and diversity hinder the development of widespread standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. Unlike other industries, MEMS lacks a coordinating body like Sematech or DARPA to chart a unified path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. To realize its full technical and commercial potential, the various players—designers, foundries, vendors, and end-users—need to collaborate more closely to establish standards and address the under-invested issues that plague the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>.

The [[History and Background of Evergrande Group | Evergrande Group]], a sprawling company, currently faces significant [[Financial Challenges and Debt of Evergrande | financial challenges and debt]], with billions of dollars in liabilities and a cash crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The situation is ongoing, with new developments daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Once China's largest real estate conglomerate, the company now has 300 billion dollars in liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Business Strategies and Early Risks

Evergrande's early growth strategy, known as "san gao yidi" (three highs, one low), prioritized high debt, high leverage, and high turnover, coupled with low cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. While enabling rapid expansion, this strategy meant the company was "teetering on a razor's edge," highly reliant on continuous increases in land prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

A significant portion of Evergrande's liabilities came from customer deposits for future homes, which differ from bank deposits and carry a much higher risk of forced withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Furthermore, over 50% of the company's debt was classified as current liabilities, meaning it could be called for repayment within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This posed a major risk, especially during periods of [[Impact of financial crises on South Korean business practices | financial crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Navigating the 2008 Global Financial Crisis

The 2008 global financial crisis sparked fears of a real estate crisis in China, plunging Evergrande into "turbulent waters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Engaged in a national expansion with approximately 37 projects underway, the company struggled with cash flow, owing about 12 to 15 billion RMB (2 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Evergrande's initial plan to pay off debt by going public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was thwarted by the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

To secure funding, Chairman Xu Jiayin sought help from wealthy contacts, eventually securing a lead investment of over 150 million USD from Cheng Yu-tung of Chao Tai Fook Group in a pre-IPO 500 million USD investment round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Other investors included Deutsche Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and the Kuwait Investment Authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This infusion stabilized the company and allowed it to proceed with its projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. The IPO eventually went ahead in November 2009, with shares rising 34% on the first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. By the end of 2009, Evergrande had total assets of 9.8 billion USD against 7.8 billion USD in liabilities, still operating on a "razor's edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

## Failed Diversification Attempts

In mid-2014, Xu Jiayin unveiled a new strategy of "diversity plus scale plus brand" to reduce reliance on real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. However, these diversification efforts often incurred significant losses and added to the company's debt burden:
*   **Mineral Water (Evergrande Bingquan)**: Despite ambitious sales targets of 1.5 billion USD in 2014 and 4.6 billion USD by 2016, the brand struggled and was unprofitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. In 2016, Evergrande sold its mineral water and food product shares for 405 million USD, which included the units' 510 million USD in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **Plastic Surgery**: In 2014, Evergrande acquired Yen-chen plastic surgery clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **New Energy Vehicles (Evergrande Auto)**: In 2018, Evergrande announced entry into the high-tech industry, including new energy vehicles, with plans to invest 7 billion USD over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. The company repurposed its Hong Kong-listed health company (formerly a gossip magazine publisher merged with hospitals) into Evergrande Auto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. In August 2020, Evergrande Auto unveiled six vehicle models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. Despite raising 500 million USD from investors like Tencent and Didi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>, and striking deals for sales networks and charging stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>, Evergrande Auto had not sold a single car by 2020 and was losing billions of RMB annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. The stock, valued at nearly 90 billion dollars in April 2021, crashed by over 95% due to these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

## Regulatory Pressure: The "Three Red Lines"

Concerns about contagion threats from massive, debt-funded Chinese conglomerates, including Evergrande, prompted government action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. Unlike sustainably funded entities like Japan's historical zaibatsu, these Chinese mini-empires were built on borrowed money, including undisclosed off-balance sheet guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

In August 2020, the Chinese government introduced the "three red lines" regulations for real estate companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>:
1.  **Liabilities-to-assets ratio**: Maximum 70% (excluding advances from contracted projects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
2.  **Net debt-to-equity ratio**: Maximum 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
3.  **Cash-to-short-term borrowings ratio**: At least 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

Companies failing to meet these requirements would be barred from adding more debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. Evergrande's metrics at the time were far from compliance:
*   Liabilities-to-asset ratio: 82% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.
*   Net debt-to-equity ratio: 199% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.
*   Cash-to-short-term borrowings ratio: 0.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>.

This caught Evergrande off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. Xu Jiayin responded by announcing a 30% price cut on 600 new builds nationwide to generate sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

## The Leaked Letter and Debt Crisis

In September 2020, a leaked letter to the Guangdong provincial government, titled "Report on Requesting Support for Major Asset Restructuring Projects," detailed Evergrande's dire financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. Though the company denied its authenticity, the market largely believed it was real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. The letter revealed interest-bearing liabilities of about 130 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>:
*   35.8 billion USD owed to 128 domestic banks (including Minsheng Bank and Agricultural Bank of China) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.
*   56.9 billion USD owed to 121 non-banking entities (real estate funds, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.
*   The remainder owed to various domestic and offshore bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.

The letter requested government help in reorganizing Evergrande's entities, warning that failure to complete the reorganization by February 2021 would trigger a 20 billion USD repayment to strategic investors, plus 2.2 billion USD in dividends, risking a "sudden cash flow crunch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>.

## Immediate Consequences and Broader Concerns

Since the leak, Evergrande has experienced a flurry of negative news, including debt downgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. Shares have dropped over 68%, and its debt has lost more than half its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. Evergrande's 2020 annual report showed approximately 300 billion USD in liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. While the company holds substantial assets (1.9 trillion RMB worth of land bank and houses under construction), these are illiquid and only valuable if vendors and construction crews are paid, putting Evergrande "in a bind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

Additional concerns include:
*   **Wealth Management Products**: Approximately 6.2 billion USD worth of high-yielding wealth management products, primarily sold to employees who then resold them to friends and family, are outstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. On September 8, 2021, two affiliates missed repayments, leading to protests at Evergrande's headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>. Five days later, Evergrande announced repayment plans using cash, property, or credit for future home payments, though many investors remain unhappy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.
*   **Off-Balance Sheet Debt**: Like Enron, Evergrande Group has numerous subsidiaries (where the group owns less than 51% of stock) that stay off the main books but still represent themselves as Evergrande companies, with their debts implicitly backed by the main group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. The full extent of this off-balance sheet debt is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

## Leadership Change and Outlook

Amid the turmoil, Xu Jiayin resigned as Evergrande's chairman on August 17, 2021, with Zhao Tanglong stepping up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.

The situation is ongoing, but it is expected that the Chinese government will not bail out Evergrande, as it is not a bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. The company is likely to undergo debt resolution in court and be slowly broken up, similar to how other massive conglomerates in crisis, such as Anbang Insurance, have been handled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

Concerns exist about the impact of Evergrande's winding down on its hundreds of new builds and the broader Chinese real estate markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. However, lower real estate prices might align with the government's social equality goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. The overall financial system's non-performing real estate loans remain low, suggesting capacity to absorb losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. The key question is whether state regulators can contain the damage from off-balance sheet issues to prevent a systemic crisis of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>.

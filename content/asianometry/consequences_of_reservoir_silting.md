Reservoir silting, also known as reservoir sedimentation, is a significant global issue that slowly erodes a dam's capacity to store water, generate power, and provide flood protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Each year, the world loses one to two percent of its [[river_silt_and_sediment_impact_on_hydropower | hydropower]] capacity due to [[river_silt_and_sediment_impact_on_hydropower | river silt and sediment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This necessitates expensive preventive measures and interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## How Silting Occurs

Rivers naturally carry two types of sediment: coarse sediment (sands and gravels, typically from the riverbed) and fine-grained sediment (smaller particles, around two millimeters wide, from the riverbed or washed into the river by rain or human activity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. When a river is dammed to create a reservoir, its normal sediment transport flow is interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. These sediments then begin to settle within the reservoir, gradually filling it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. When the reservoir accumulates too much sediment, it can no longer hold its intended volume of water, a situation known as reservoir sedimentation or silting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The storage capacity lost to silting is referred to as "dead storage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Specific Consequences

Silting affects every reservoir eventually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, with various detrimental impacts:

### Reduced Water Storage Capacity
The primary function of many reservoirs is to store drinking water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. As sediment accumulates, the reservoir's capacity to hold water diminishes, directly impacting water supply for drinking, irrigation, and other uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Impaired Hydropower Generation
[[river_silt_and_sediment_impact_on_hydropower | Sediment significantly harms energy generation at hydropower dams]] in several ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>:
*   **Erosion of Components** Coarse sediments can erode the turbine runner blades, abrade gate seals and spillways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Clogged Intakes** Sediments can clog up intake valves, preventing water flow to the turbines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. For example, during Hurricane David in 1979, 17 meters of sediment and debris blocked the Valdezia Dam in the Dominican Republic, blocking power intakes for half a year, with dredging efforts continuing for 28 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Decreased Flood Protection
Dams are often built to protect downstream areas from flooding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A silted reservoir has less capacity to detain floodwaters, increasing the risk of spills and massive damage downstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Historic Australian dams, for instance, were ill-equipped to handle massive influxes of muddy floodwaters, leading to significant consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Hindered Navigation
Accumulated sediment makes it difficult for boats to carry cargo and access dam locks, impeding commercial shipping and other forms of river travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Environmental and Health Hazards
When accumulated sediment in a reservoir dries up, it can take to the air, causing dust storms and posing health hazards to local residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Economic Burden
Managing reservoir silting involves significant economic costs due to:
*   **Preventive Measures and Interventions** These are often expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Sediment Removal** Techniques like dry excavation and dredging are costly. In 1993, dry excavating several dams in Los Angeles County cost between $5 to $30 per square meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. In Taiwan, the government spent $160 million on dredging the Taiwan Reservoir, yet only restored 8% of its total capacity due to high sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### Presumed Obsolescence
Historically, reservoirs were designed with a working life of around a hundred years, after which they were presumed to be lost due to siltation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. However, many dams are critical infrastructure that cannot simply be abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Regional Impacts

### Taiwan
Taiwan's reservoirs are particularly affected by silting due to its [[impact_of_geography_and_weather_on_reservoir_silting | mountainous geography]] with loose soils and frequent, long-lasting typhoon storms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. These rains sweep loose soils into rivers, dramatically increasing sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. For instance, Typhoon Morakot in 2009 deposited an estimated 90 million cubic meters of sediment into Taiwan's largest reservoir, the Zengwen Reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The critically important Nanhua Reservoir, which provides 40% of the area's water, suffers from extensive siltation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### Australia
Prior to the 1970s, reservoir sedimentation was not a major consideration for Australian engineers, as sediment yields were presumed to be low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This proved incorrect, with over 20 dams becoming fully silted between 1890 and 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Many of these older dams, some built for steam engines, are still in use for irrigation or emergency water storage, highlighting the ongoing challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Dams, though appearing as invincible as mountains, are pieces of human-built infrastructure that require continuous effort to maintain their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Iran faces a long-running water problem, stemming from its historically arid climate and low rainfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Much of the country's central lands are inherently uninhabitable without significant water sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Over centuries, Iran has developed extensive water systems to irrigate its dry soil and support its growing population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Iran's Climate and Water Resources

Iran experiences low precipitation, ranking 158th out of 189 countries in terms of annual average precipitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The rainfall is also unevenly distributed:
*   75% of precipitation falls on just 25% of the country's area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   50% of Iran's rainfall occurs during the winter months, with only 4% during the summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   Certain areas, like the central deserts, receive less than 50 millimeters of rainfall annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Major Water Bodies

Iran borders significant water bodies, but their utility for drinking water is limited:
*   **Caspian Sea (North)**: The world's largest inland body of water, it is brackish and not drinkable without desalination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This area receives most of Iran's rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman (South)**: This southern water basin covers only a quarter of Iran's land but holds nearly half of its renewable water resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Rivers and Lakes

Snowmelt from large mountains and slopes facing these water bodies creates several rivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. However, with the exception of the Karun River, most of these rivers are seasonal, often overflowing in spring but having minimal flow during summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Iran also has 10 lakes, most of which are very salty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Ultimately, less than one percent of Iran's 1.6 million square kilometers is surface water, indicating a general scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Historical Water Management: The Qanat System

Iran's dry climate is not a new phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Early civilizations (around 1250 BC) settled in the relatively water-rich Southwest and Northwest, with settling the arid center requiring advanced water management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Around 3,000 years ago, the ancient Persians pioneered the "qanat" system, a sophisticated water supply method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Qanats are gently downward-sloping underground tunnels that transport snowmelt water from mountains to plains, sometimes spanning tens of kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   They relied purely on gravity, operating automatically, and being underground, the water remained cool and did not evaporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   Water not needed for irrigation could be dammed and stored for later use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   This knowledge was passed down through generations, leading to the spread of qanats from Luxembourg to Xinjiang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   Prudent water management, through qanats, enabled the success of the Achaemenid Empire (550 to 330 BC), which became the largest known empire of its day despite lacking a major river like the Yangtze or Euphrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   The engineering discipline continued to develop, with one of the oldest hydrogeology books, "The Extraction of Hidden Waters" by Muhammad al-Karaji, written over a thousand years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

When Tehran became the capital in 1786, 500 qanats were built over 200 years to supply the city, and many more were constructed across Iran's Central Plains, totaling over 270,000 kilometers of underground tunnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Modernization and Decline of Qanats

In the 1900s, population water needs surpassed the qanat system's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   A new government led by Reza Shah Pahlavi aimed to modernize the country, settling nomadic populations into villages, which created a need for consistent water supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   With limited surface water, Iran turned to hydraulic mega-projects like dams and irrigation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   Iran's first modern water well was built in 1915, and these quickly gained popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Wells were quick to build and used electrically powered pumps to access plentiful groundwater, unlike qanats which were expensive and labor-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   Authorities promoted modern systems, leading to the disrepair of qanats. By 1950, qanats supplied only 50% of the country's water, down from 75% in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### The White Revolution and its Impact

In 1963, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi implemented the "White Revolution," a land reform scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   The population was rapidly growing (25.8 million, expanding at 3% annually) with increasing urbanization, driving the need for industrial agriculture to feed the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   The reform aimed to transfer 50% of agricultural lands from landlords to peasants, who were to be taught new growing techniques and given tools like fertilizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   This had profound effects on qanats: landlords, who previously maintained them, no longer did, and no centralized authority competently took over their maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   By 2000, less than 10% of Iran's water came from qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   The government focused on building dams and pumping groundwater, initiating 19 new dam projects (14 completed by 1979) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Irrigated land expanded significantly, from 8,000 square kilometers in 1968 to 22,662 square kilometers in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   However, even in those days, Iran began experiencing [[natural_resource_dependence_and_economic_challenges | problems of groundwater over-extraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, leading to a 1966 parliamentary ban on drilling and over-pumping due to a dropping water table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   The land reform itself failed to meet its promises for most peasant families, contributing to social instabilities that paved the way for the Islamic Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Post-Revolution Water Challenges

After the 1979 Islamic Revolution:
*   Trade restrictions limited Iranian access to advanced water technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   A drive for food self-sufficiency, especially during the Iran-Iraq War, encouraged massive agricultural expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   The revolution also encouraged rapid population growth, with Iran's population expanding by an average of 1 million people each year over three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. By late 2022, Iran's population was estimated at 88.5 million, more than four times its 1960 size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Agricultural Water Use and Inefficiency

To support this population and maintain self-sufficiency, Iran significantly increased crop production, with a 175% growth from 1980 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   93% of all water used in Iran is for farming, with the mining industry being a distant second at 1.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   The government heavily subsidized water and fertilizer costs for the agricultural sector, and guaranteed food purchase prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   Nearly free water encouraged inefficient use; Iran's average irrigation efficiency is under 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Over 70% of land is surface irrigated, leading to substantial water loss from evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   This inefficiency has contributed to agriculture's decline within the primarily oil-based economy, providing only 12.4% of the country's GDP in 2021, down from 25.9% in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   Despite efforts, Iran remains short of complete food self-sufficiency, importing 1.8 million tons of wheat from Russia in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Reforms to improve farming efficiency face challenges due to agriculture employing 23% of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

### Fragmented Water Management

After the Islamic Revolution, Water Resource Management Affairs were decentralized from a single body to multiple entities:
*   **Ministry of Health and Medical Education**: Sets drinking water quality standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Energy (formerly Ministry of Water and Power)**: Allocates water for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use, and regulates wastewater and hydropower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Agriculture Jihad**: Formed by a 2001 merger, it allocates water among farmers and collects water fees. The "Jihad" component, originating from revolutionaries building rural infrastructure, built water infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Department of Environment**: Controls water pollution, prepares policies, and assesses hydropower and irrigation projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
This fragmented approach hinders an integrated solution to water supply issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

## Growing Supply vs. Cutting Demand

In recent decades, the Iranian government has focused on increasing water supply rather than cutting demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.
*   Iran has become one of the world's biggest dam-building countries, with over 588 large and small dams and about 100 more under construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. While providing reservoirs and hydroelectric power, damming can have widespread negative [[environmental_and_economic_impacts_of_desalination | environmental effects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. For example, the Upper Gotvand Dam accumulated 66.5 million tons of salt, raising salinity levels in surrounding agricultural soils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   To meet rising urban water demand, the government is building high-profile [[water_scarcity_and_desalination_in_the_gulf_region | desalination plants]] on the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. However, transporting this desalinated water to central mega-cities is expensive, and it is likely not economically viable for agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

### Draining Surface Water and Groundwater Depletion

Increased agricultural demand and development have severely drained Iran's surface water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **Lake Urmia**, once the largest lake in Iran and the Middle East, has aggressively shrunk due to persistent drought and water mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. A massive bridge completed in the early 2000s exacerbated its shrinkage by cutting the lake in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Today, the lake is a tenth of its former size, causing huge salt storms that ruin nearby farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **Hamoun Lake** in Eastern Iran, a seasonal freshwater body on the border with Afghanistan, vanished entirely during a drought in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. Its dry bed caused severe dust storms, leading to the evacuation of 124 surrounding villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

Groundwater has become Iran's primary water source, accounting for 55% of the total supply in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
*   From 2002 to 2015, an estimated 74 cubic kilometers of water were extracted from the ground, equivalent to the world's 34th largest freshwater lake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   The number of wells in Iran surged from 47,000 in 1979 to 789,000 in 2013, with almost all being illegal, highlighting immense demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   As groundwater is withdrawn, the water table declines, forcing deeper drilling, especially during serious droughts which are intensifying with climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   Consequences of declining groundwater include:
    *   **Increased Salinity**: Soil and groundwater become saltier, with electrical conductivity measurements in some areas like the Karkheh Basin (a major agricultural area) being 85% higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
    *   **Land Subsidence**: The ground literally sinks, with Iran's land shrinking at an average of about six centimeters per year, and some areas reaching a staggering 19 centimeters per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. This damages infrastructure (transmission lines, bridges, buildings), undermines structural safety during earthquakes, and permanently damages the aquifer's capacity to hold water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

While population growth contributes to less renewable water per person, the core of Iran's [[challenges_and_future_directions_in_desalination | water crisis]] lies in demand and mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. Difficult decisions regarding water usage in homes, industry, and especially farms are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Implementing long-term reforms is challenging for a populist government amidst climate change and political turbulence, but the long-term costs of water mismanagement are severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

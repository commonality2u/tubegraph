Iran, a country historically prone to aridity, has developed extensive water infrastructure to support its population and agricultural needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This development, however, has led to significant challenges in [[irans_water_history_and_management | water management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Historical Water Management: The Qanat System

For approximately 3,000 years, ancient Persians utilized a sophisticated underground water supply system called the Qanat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
The Qanat system featured:
*   Gently downward-sloping underground tunnels that transported snowmelt water from mountains to plains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   Reliance purely on gravity, making it automatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   Underground design, which kept water cool and prevented evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   Ability to be dammed and stored for later use when not needed for irrigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

This system was crucial for settling the arid center of Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> and enabled the success of the Achaemenid Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. By the 1900s, over 270,000 kilometers of these underground tunnels had been built across Iran, including 500 Qanats supplying Tehran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Shift to Modern Infrastructure and Decline of Qanats

As Iran's population and water needs grew, the Qanat system struggled to keep pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. A new government after World War I, led by Reza Shah Pahlavi, sought to modernize the country, including settling nomadic populations who then required consistent water access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

The focus shifted to "hydraulic mega projects" like dams and irrigation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The first modern water well was built in 1915, and such wells quickly gained popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, largely due to their speed and ease of construction compared to the labor-intensive Qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The authorities actively promoted these new systems, leading to the Qanats falling into disrepair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. By 1950, Qanats supplied only 50% of the country's water, down from 75% in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

The 1963 "White Revolution" land reform further impacted Qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Previously, landlords bore the cost of Qanat maintenance, effectively making them a public good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. After the reform, no centralized authority competently took over their maintenance, and the newly established Ministry of Water and Power in 1964 largely ignored them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This led to a devastating blow for Qanats, with less than 10% of Iran's water coming from them by 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Industrial-Level Water Management Post-Revolution

With only 10.5% of its land arable, Iran's government focused on building dams and pumping [[consequences_of_groundwater_overuse | groundwater]] to expand irrigated lands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Between 1968 and 1976, the amount of irrigated land expanded significantly, from 8,000 to 22,662 square kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

After the Islamic Revolution in 1979, trade restrictions with the West encouraged Iran to become self-sufficient in food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This, combined with rapid population growth (averaging 1 million people per year over three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, quadrupling since 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>), intensified the drive for agricultural expansion. Crop production grew 175% from 1980 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

To achieve this, the Iranian government heavily subsidized water and fertilizer costs for farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This policy, providing "nearly free water," encouraged inefficient use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, with irrigation efficiency under 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Over 70% of the land is surface irrigated, leading to substantial water loss through evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Decentralized Water Management

Following the Islamic Revolution, Water Resource Management Affairs were devolved from a single centralized body to several ministries and departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>:
*   **Ministry of Health and Medical Education:** Sets drinking water quality standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Energy:** Allocates water for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use; regulates wastewater and hydropower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Agriculture Jihad:** Allocates water among farmers and collects water fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Its predecessor, the Ministry of Construction Jihad, built water infrastructure like water distribution pipes, roads, bridges, and water filtration systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Department of Environment:** Controls water pollution, prepares policies, and assesses hydropower and irrigation projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

This divided management approach hinders an integrated solution to water supply issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

## Impact of Modern Water Infrastructure

Iran has continued and even "supercharged" its dam building efforts, becoming one of the world's biggest dam-building countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. There are currently over 588 dams, with about 100 more under construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. While dams create water reservoirs and hydroelectric power, years of water impoundment can damage the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. For example, the Upper Gotvand Dam, completed in 2012, has accumulated over 66.5 million tons of salt, raising salinity levels in surrounding soils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

To meet rising urban water demand, the government is building desalination plants on the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. However, transporting this desalinated water to central mega-cities is expensive and not considered economically viable for agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

Agricultural demand and increased development have severely drained Iran's surface water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Lake Urmia, once Iran's largest lake, has shrunk to a tenth of its former size due to drought and water mismanagement, exacerbated by a massive bridge construction project that cut the lake in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. The dry lake bed now causes huge salt storms that ruin nearby farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Similarly, Hamoun Lake in eastern Iran vanished entirely during a drought in 2001, leading to dust storms and the evacuation of 124 villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## Groundwater Over-extraction and its Consequences

[[consequences_of_groundwater_overuse | Groundwater]] has rapidly become Iran's primary water source, accounting for 55% of the total supply in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. From 2002 to 2015, over 74 cubic kilometers of water were extracted from the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

The number of wells in Iran surged from 47,000 in 1979 to 789,000 by 2013, with almost all being illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. This unregulated extraction leads to a declining water table, forcing people to drill deeper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

The [[consequences_of_groundwater_overuse | consequences of groundwater overuse]] include:
*   **Increased Salinity:** The soil and groundwater become saltier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
*   **Land Subsidence:** The ground literally sinks, with Iran's land shrinking at an average of about six centimeters per year, and some areas reaching a staggering 19 centimeters annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure Damage:** Sinking ground damages transmission lines, bridges, and buildings, and undermines structural safety, especially in earthquake-prone areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
*   **Permanent Aquifer Damage:** Subsidence damages the aquifer's capacity to carry water, sometimes permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

The core of Iran's water crisis lies in demand and mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>, with long-term reforms necessary to address the heavy costs of water mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

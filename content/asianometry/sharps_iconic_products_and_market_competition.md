Sharp Corporation, a Japanese electronics company with over a century of history, has introduced numerous iconic products over the years, including the mechanical pencil, calculators, and televisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, starting around the turn of the century, Sharp found itself increasingly confined to a single, highly competitive business, facing intense pressure from foreign competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This ultimately led to the company being sold to a Taiwanese electronics giant, marking the first foreign takeover of a major Japanese consumer electronics company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This article discusses the [[rise_and_decline_of_japans_sharp_corporation | rise and decline of Sharp Corporation]] through its key product innovations and the market competition it faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Early Innovations and Foundations

Sharp's origins trace back to its founder, Takuji Hayakawa, who was born in 1893 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. After years of apprenticeship in metalworking, Hayakawa established his own metal workshop in Tokyo at age 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### The Mechanical Pencil

Hayakawa's first invention was the "Tokubido" belt buckle, which could be fastened without needing to punch holes, selling 4,752 pieces and requiring a significant capacity expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. His second major invention was the "Hayakawa mechanical pencil" in 1915, a superior version of a poor-quality mechanical pencil he was commissioned to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This pencil became a hit, especially during World War I when German imports were scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The business rapidly expanded, leading to a new factory in 1923 with 200 workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Entry into Radio and Television

Following the devastating Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, which destroyed his factory and resulted in immense personal loss, Hayakawa moved to Osaka and rebuilt his business, establishing Hayakawa Metal Laboratories in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. He then ventured into radio manufacturing.

*   **Crystal Radio "Sharp"**: In 1925, Hayakawa released Japan's first domestically assembled crystal radio, named "Sharp." Priced at 3.5 Yen, it was significantly cheaper than foreign competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Its timing was perfect, coinciding with the start of Japan's first radio program by the Tokyo Broadcasting Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Vacuum Tube Radios (Sharp Dyne)**: Recognizing the limitations of crystal radios, Hayakawa developed the "Sharp Dyne" series of vacuum tube radios, which could amplify signals and volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. These models were also more affordable than imported versions and sold rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. By 1942, the company changed its name to Hayakawa Electric Company, producing various radios, including advanced two-way radios for military use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Television (TV 314T)**: With technical assistance from RCA, Hayakawa Electric produced Japan's first commercially available television, the TV 314T, released in February 1953, coinciding with NHK's first public television broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Despite its high cost, its early entry secured Sharp's dominance in the domestic television market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Other Products**: In 1962, the company released Japan's first microwave, the R-10, and its first solar-powered consumer electronics product, a transistor radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Sharp remained a leading solar cell producer into the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Calculator Era and the "Calculator Wars"

In the 1960s, Hayakawa Electric focused on sophisticated non-programmable consumer electronics like calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

*   **CS-10A Compat**: In 1964, they launched the CS-10A Compat, one of the first all-transistor calculators. It weighed 25 kilograms, used 530 transistors, and cost approximately $15,000 in today's USD, but its initial supply of 300 units sold out quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **CS-20A and CS-31A**: Subsequent models, such as the CS-20A (1965) and CS-31A (1966), became more power-efficient, reliable, and cheaper due to falling silicon transistor prices and the use of integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. By 1966, Sharp held 44% of the Japanese calculator market share, exporting about half of its 24,000 units to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

This success ignited the "Calculator Wars," drawing over 50 Japanese manufacturers and several American ones into the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This intense competition rapidly transformed calculators from desktop machines to portable, battery-powered gadgets running on a single integrated chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### The Dawn of LCD Technology

To gain an edge in the calculator market, Sharp sought a more efficient display technology than the expensive, large, and power-inefficient fluorescent or Nixie tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. A Sharp researcher learned about Dynamic Scattering Mode (DSM) Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) demonstrated by RCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Although RCA declined to develop LCD screens for Sharp's calculators, Sharp licensed RCA's patents in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

*   **LC Mate EL-805**: After extensive research, Sharp introduced the LC Mate EL-805 calculator in June 1973, featuring a DSM LCD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. This product was revolutionary, being 12 times thinner than competitors, consuming 1/9000th the power, lasting 100 hours on a single charge, and weighing just 200 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. By 1985, Sharp had cumulatively sold over 200 million calculator units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## The LCD Pivot and Intensified Competition

Sharp continued its LCD research, leading to the development of Thin-Film Transistor (TFT) LCD technology, seen as a potential replacement for CRTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. In 1987, Sharp successfully produced a 14-inch full-color, full-motion LCD display, and in 1991, they debuted the first wall-mounted television, the 9EHC1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

However, this strong position in LCD contrasted sharply with the rest of the company's performance. Following Japan's real estate bubble unraveling, the domestic economy weakened, leading to increased wages and manufacturing offshoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Cheap foreign imports challenged Sharp's older products like fax machines, calculators, and microwave ovens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. While some new products like the Viewcam camcorder (20% Japanese market share in 1992) were successful, others like the Wizard electronic organizer failed, and saturated markets like notebook PCs proved unprofitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. Profits declined throughout the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

### [[Innovation and challenges in Sharps LCD business | LCD as the Core Strategy]]

By 1998, LCD panels and related products accounted for 30% of Sharp's revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. New president Katsuhiko Machida repositioned Sharp's LCD business at the company's center, aiming to make LCD technology its "face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Sharp ditched its CRT television business and went all-in on LCD televisions, launching its Aquos TV brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

*   **Early Success**: In 2001, Aquos quickly captured 80% global market share in the nascent LCD TV market, generating nearly $400 million USD in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. By mid-2003, Aquos dominated the Japanese market with 60% share, and in 2004, Sharp held a leading 33% share in the overall LCD industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
*   **Rising Competition**: However, competitors like Samsung, LG, and AU Optronics were catching up rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. In 2002, Samsung surprised the industry by being the first to produce 5th generation LCDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   **Massive Investments and Oversupply**: To maintain its lead, Sharp invested billions into new TFT LCD factories, notably the Kamiyama plant (completed 2004 and 2006) costing $4 billion USD and producing over a million panels annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. This represented a major bet on Japan-based production, as other Japanese companies had offshored LCD production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
    *   Unfortunately, these facilities came online concurrently with other massive plants built by Taiwanese, Korean, and other Japanese firms, leading to an industry-wide oversupply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. A 32-inch TV panel that cost $865 in 2004 dropped to $149 by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
    *   Sharp's TV market share plummeted from 80% to under 10% throughout the 2000s, as LCD televisions became a cheap commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.
*   **Sakai Plant and Sony Partnership Failure**: In 2007, Sharp announced another $3.4 billion USD investment in the Sakai factories, projecting even higher production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. A key partnership with Sony, which was to take a 33% ownership in the Sakai factories, failed due to Sharp's internal competition between its TV and display panel divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. Sony never acquired more than 7% and eventually sold its stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.
*   **[[Impact of global financial trends on Sharps operations | Financial Crisis and Decline]]**: The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 led to collapsing sales and increased losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. In March 2009, Sharp reported its first net loss since going public in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. By 2009, Sharp's TV market share was just 6-7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. Their inability to balance LCD panel supply and TV businesses led to losses in both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. By March 2012, Sharp faced a net loss of over $5 billion, nearing bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.
*   **Missed Transitions**: Sharp also missed critical industry transitions to new display technologies like LED-backlit LCD screens and OLED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. In the smartphone market, Sharp and Fujitsu lost their grip on the domestic Japanese space to Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

## [[Mergers and acquisitions involving Sharp | Foxconn Acquisition and Reorientation]]

In March 2013, Sharp announced a staggering $5 billion loss, leading to the departure of its top leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

*   **Foxconn's Interest**: Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics giant, first bought a 9.9% stake in Sharp in 2012 for about $854 million, seeking to vertically integrate displays into its supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Sharp's display capacity and technology were appealing additions to Foxconn's strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   **Foreign Takeover**: After several years of decline and declining Foxconn offers, Sharp finally accepted Foxconn's offer in 2016 to purchase a controlling 66% stake for $3.8 billion (down from an initial $6.2 billion due to Sharp's liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. This acquisition marked the first foreign takeover of a leading Japanese electronics firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.
*   **Post-Acquisition**: Under Foxconn's leadership, Sharp began to cut costs, close unprofitable overseas ventures, reduce employees, and move production out of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. In its first full year under Taiwanese management, Sharp turned a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. The company has reoriented towards producing branded electronics products and rebuilding its semiconductor manufacturing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.

Sharp's journey highlights how a company's initial success through timely product innovation can be undone by intense market competition, over-reliance on a single product category, and an inability to adapt to changing industry dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. The display panel business, characterized by low margins and high insecurity, ultimately proved challenging for Sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.

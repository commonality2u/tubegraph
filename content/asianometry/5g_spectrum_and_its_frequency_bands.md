5G represents the latest transition in wireless technology, promising immense bandwidth and super-fast speeds, particularly through the use of [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | Millimeter-Wave]] spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, its rollout has faced [[Technical and economic obstacles in mmWave deployment | difficult technical and economic challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This article explores the various frequency bands utilized by 5G and the underlying technology required for their operation.

## Fundamentals of Wireless Communication
A wave's wavelength is the distance it travels in a single cycle, measured in meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Frequency, measured in hertz, indicates how many cycles pass through a given point per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. A megahertz signifies a million cycles per second, a gigahertz a billion, and a terahertz a trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Frequency and wavelength are inversely related: as frequencies increase, wavelengths decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For instance, gamma rays have wavelengths measured in picometers and high energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Countries allocate specific parts of the electromagnetic spectrum for various uses like radar, wireless communication, or WiFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Spectrum is a fundamentally limited resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Previous wireless generations, from 1G through 4G, primarily used frequency bands below 7.125 gigahertz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The 4G era saw the world's telecoms converge on the [[Standards and strategic evolution of 5G networks | LTE standard]] due to its superior data downlink speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. LTE had to accommodate frequencies ranging from 450 megahertz to 3.6 gigahertz, making "world phone" development difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. A larger issue was the capacity constraint from using small frequency slices, with typical cell operators having only about 200 megahertz of spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## The Vision for 5G
Engineers designed 5G to be more flexible in its frequency band usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The [[Standards and strategic evolution of 5G networks | 5G standard]] aimed to support multiple use cases:
*   **Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB)**: To handle increasing data traffic, primarily mobile video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Networking (URLLC)**: For time-critical data requiring quick and reliable delivery, such as self-driving cars or wirelessly controlled robot arms, with signal delivery needed in under 10 milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC)**: For numerous low-cost machines transmitting data infrequently over long periods, like sensors, actuators, and vending machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

These diverse goals led to 5G's design accommodating a wide range of frequencies, including entirely new spectrum slices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## The Millimeter Wave Spectrum
In 2011, Zhouyue Pi and Farooq Khan from Samsung Electronics proposed exploring the then-largely unused [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave]] regions for 5G, specifically suggesting bands in the 70/80/90 gigahertz range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. These are called [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | millimeter wave]] bands because their wavelengths are in the 1-10 millimeter range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The FCC opened them for new economic development in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Historically, this spectrum was used for military radars, satellite communications, or cellular back-haul (point-to-point connections with fixed antennas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

After Samsung's paper and research from NYU and UT Austin in 2014 demonstrated technical feasibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, 5G gained support for a set of high-frequency bands from 24.25 to 52.6 gigahertz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This was in addition to two other sets of bands in more traditional sub-7 gigahertz neighborhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Why mmWave?
Higher carrier frequencies, such as those in the [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave]] spectrum, allow for significantly more bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. A 10% bandwidth of 25 gigahertz is much greater than 10% of 7 gigahertz, meaning higher data capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### [[Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits and their role in 5G | RFICs]] and Signal Transmission
[[Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits and their role in 5G | Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits]], or [[Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits and their role in 5G | RFICs]], convert digital bits into a continuous analog "baseband" signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Because baseband signals are low frequency and would require impractically large antennas for phones, [[Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits and their role in 5G | RFICs]] use a mixer to "upconvert" the baseband signal with a higher "carrier frequency" into a "passband" signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The carrier frequency is chosen based on regulatory allocation and wireless technology standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. The actual data is encoded in "sidebands" around the carrier frequency, and the bandwidth encompasses the range from the lowest to highest sideband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Challenges of mmWave Propagation
[[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave]] signals face significant challenges in propagation:
*   **Path Loss**: As a signal travels outwards spherically, its power density dilutes, a phenomenon known as "path loss," which contributes to signal attenuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Path loss is proportional to the wavelength squared, meaning higher frequency waves (like mmWave) travel less effectively over distance compared to lower frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Obstruction**: [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave]] signals cannot easily penetrate objects like buildings, foliage, or even the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Bricks, trees, and outdoor tinted glass are particularly effective at attenuating [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave]] signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Even turning away from a base station can drastically drop performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Line of Sight**: [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave]] works best in extremely busy areas with "line of sight," such as sports arenas, malls, and airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

To counteract path loss, signals are amplified by a power amplifier within the [[Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits and their role in 5G | RFIC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Since mmWave wavelengths are smaller, antennas can be smaller and integrated into arrays (up to 32 antennas) to generate directional beams aimed at the tower or base station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Densification
Due to the limited range and penetration of [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave]], telecoms must install many small cells in dense amounts, potentially as close as 50-100 meters apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This "densification" is a challenging, time-consuming task, requiring 24/7 power, back-haul connections, and aesthetically inconspicuous designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Telecoms are even considering leveraging reflectors on billboards or exterior glass to bounce [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave]] signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

## 5G Deployment Strategies
The [[Standards and strategic evolution of 5G networks | 5G New Radio standard]] supports three sets of 5G bands: low, mid, and high bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **Low and Mid Bands**: These are between 410 megahertz and 7.1 gigahertz, offering good coverage but weaker capacity, similar to 4G LTE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
*   **High Band (mmWave)**: This spectrum promises the most capacity and data rates but requires the most work to deploy due to propagation and densification challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

Telecoms have two primary ways to deploy 5G, given their existing LTE networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>:
*   **Standalone (SA)**: A completely new 5G network with 5G base stations connected to a 5G core network and 5G [[Standards and strategic evolution of 5G networks | New Radio]] consumer devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Non-Standalone (NSA)**: A stepping stone where [[Standards and strategic evolution of 5G networks | 5G New Radio]] connects to a 4G LTE core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. This offers somewhat faster speeds and LTE fallback, but the improvement is not significant, especially at lower bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

## US Deployment Experience
Verizon and AT&T were early adopters of [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave 5G]] in the United States, as their lower-frequency bands were already occupied by 3G and 4G networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. In 2018, Verizon began deploying Non-Standalone 5G for mobile and fixed wireless access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. While fixed wireless access has seen some success, the mobile service rollout encountered difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Customers were not highly willing to pay a premium for faster rates, and confusing 5G branding exacerbated the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

Even with Apple's iPhone 12 introducing [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave]] support in the US in late 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave]] usage did not meet expectations. Analysts predicted [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave]] would carry about 5% of mobile traffic in 2021, with Verizon expecting 50% of urban traffic "over time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. However, OpenSignal reported only 2.9% of US urban mobile traffic was consumed on [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave 5G]] in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. Studies indicated that slight movements could cause phones to fall back to 4G LTE, raising skepticism about return on investment for large-city coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

Consequently, Verizon and AT&T adjusted their strategy, purchasing licenses for 5G mid-band spectrum (3.7 gigahertz "C-band") in February 2021, with Verizon spending over $45 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. They have since focused on expanding mid-band offerings, including their Standalone 5G networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. Apple's device support for [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave]] remains limited to US iPhones, with iPads recently dropping support entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Conclusion
Telecoms continue to expand [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave]], primarily for fixed wireless access in rural areas and high-density urban areas like airports and sports stadiums, where it performs best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. The "internet of things" and Industry 4.0 initiatives that 5G was expected to enable broadly have not yet emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. In the United States, [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave]] deployments have not met expectations, leading the FCC to seek creative solutions for its largely unused spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. Outside the US, few countries have widely adopted [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave]], with Japan being a notable exception due to its network setup for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. As technology evolves and telecoms move towards Standalone 5G with ongoing improvements, the future role of [[MillimeterWave 5G challenges and prospects | mmWave]] in this progression remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

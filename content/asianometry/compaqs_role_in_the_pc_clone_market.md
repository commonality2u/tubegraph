The early years of the Compaq Computer Company saw a period of [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | absolutely insane growth]] that remains legendary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Founded in 1982, Compaq achieved $111 million in revenue in its first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, followed by an IPO in December 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. By its second year in 1984, revenue reached $329 million, representing 200% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. In its third year, revenue climbed to $504 million with 53% growth, earning it a spot on the Fortune 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. By 1987, Compaq hit $1.2 billion in revenue, the fastest in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Compaq led a significant insurgency of IBM PC clone-makers against IBM, also known as Big Blue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This effort ultimately overwhelmed IBM and unlocked the PC standard for a new generation of PC-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, this success also marked the beginning of [[compaqs_challenges_and_decline | Compaq's problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, as the revolution it led eventually turned on the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Engines of Growth

Compaq's early success was driven by several key factors:

### Product Innovation
Compaq offered a breakthrough product that was both compatible with and sufficiently differentiated from the original IBM PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The Compaq Portable, while not a true laptop, could be transported, a capability the original IBM PC lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. IBM didn't introduce its own portable until February 1984, over a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The Portable's cheaper price made it an attractive second computer for working professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Compaq also prioritized compatibility with IBM's formidable business software ecosystem, including Lotus 1-2-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This required a "cleanroom" approach, with two teams re-implementing the IBM PC BIOS code, and strict fidelity to IBM PC's hardware, including the keyboard layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Speed to Market
Compaq's product development cycle was significantly faster than IBM's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. While IBM's process took 12 to 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, Compaq's chaotic yet efficient method took only 6 to 9 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This allowed Compaq to bring new technologies to market more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. A classic example is the iconic Deskpro 386, the first IBM PC clone with a leading-edge silicon, which hit the market a full year before IBM offered something similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Compaq was also faster than anyone, including IBM, in stocking shelves, presenting a compelling alternative during IBM's frequent stock-outs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Distribution Strategy
Compaq's third major growth engine was its strong relationship with dealers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Unlike IBM, which sold through both its own sales force and retailers, Compaq made retailers its only distribution channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Cofounder and CEO Rod Canion emphasized "Keep the seller sold" and "A dealer done right can be the best distribution mechanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This strategy saved money on a large sales force and fostered dealer loyalty, as retailers knew Compaq wouldn't compete directly with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

> I view that as a real big plus for me. I can sell a corporation a single IBM, maybe two. If they decide they want 100 of them, they go to IBM and get a 30% discount and I lose a big account. But for Compaq they have to come to me. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>

This dealer-centric model was an early advantage, though it would later become a fatal weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## The High and the Rise of New Clones

After successfully launching the Deskpro 386 and leading the revolt against IBM, Compaq appeared to be firing on all cylinders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Business media praised Compaq's success and unique business style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. A 1990 Harvard Business Review interview with Rod Canion lauded the company's consensus-oriented culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

However, the industry was rapidly changing. The modularity of components in [[competitive_dynamics_and_market_saturation_in_the_hard_disk_drive_industry | Hard Disk Drives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> and the broader PC ecosystem meant that by mid-1985, components could be easily assembled with few issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This meant that the perceived performance of a computer largely depended on Microsoft's OS software and Intel's silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

The success of the Deskpro 386 ironically inspired a new generation of market entrants from the U.S. and East Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. It became easy for these companies to obtain a 386 chip and MS-DOS to introduce their own "super-clones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. At the Fall 1986 Comdex show, a multitude of 386-equipped PC clones, many just prototypes, signaled a rush to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

These new clones from companies like Dell and Gateway were just as powerful as Compaq's products but significantly cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This price difference stemmed from cheaper materials, offshore labor, or different business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Companies like Dell and CompuAdd bypassed dealer markups by selling directly through telephone or mail-order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Dell, in particular, ran aggressive advertising campaigns comparing its offerings and prices to Compaq's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Consumers consistently paid a 67% premium for a Compaq system compared to a similar Gateway 2000 system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

Compaq was slow to acknowledge or respond to this price competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. In December 1990, Michael Swavely, President of Compaq North America, stated, "You can charge a premium price if you build the best machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Swavely retired just months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Innovation and Missed Opportunities

While Compaq was quick to integrate new technologies, it produced few of these innovations itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. In the late 1980s, only about 4% of its revenues were invested in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, making it beholden to critical partners like Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Rod Canion's memoir recounts confronting Intel's Andy Grove in late 1989 to prioritize the 486 chip, illustrating Compaq's dependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

Compaq also missed opportunities in emerging markets. Despite Rod Canion's personal desire for a laptop in early 1984, market research indicated the market wasn't yet big, and the idea was shelved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. However, in 1986, Toshiba released the T3100, which sold well despite requiring an external power source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Compaq didn't introduce its own laptop, the SLT, until October 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, indicating it was ill-equipped to keep up with the rapidly changing business environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

## European Expansion and Early Decline

Despite intensifying competition and a lack of self-generated innovation, Compaq continued to grow revenues and profits, with revenues multiplying five times over to $3 billion between 1986 and 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. The secret behind this growth was the company's European operations, led by Eckhard Pfeiffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Pfeiffer, who joined in 1983, transplanted the dealer-only structure across the UK and Europe with little guidance from U.S. HQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Compaq ignited huge growth in a largely untapped market, with the British subsidiary turning a profit in its first month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. By 1990, over half of Compaq's revenues came from abroad, mostly Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

However, things started to go downhill in mid-1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. The First Gulf War in August 1990 caused oil shocks and a mini-recession, leading to lower company budgets and accelerating the growth of clones, forcing Compaq to cut hardware prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. A growing divide emerged between management and stakeholders regarding the market landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Chairman Ben Rosen grew concerned about Compaq's ability to keep up with competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

In May 1991, Compaq pre-announced an 81% fall in second-quarter profits, causing its stock to drop 27%, losing $1.2 billion in market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Management, however, viewed this as "short-term perturbations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. By October 1991, Compaq reported its first quarterly loss in years and laid off 12% of its workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

During a brutal board meeting, Rosen demanded a low-end Compaq PC in three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. When Canion stated this was impossible without sacrificing quality, Rosen revealed that two Compaq employees had secretly assembled two demo PCs from off-the-shelf parts in three days in a motel room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Canion's continued refusal to bend led to his firing, and Eckhard Pfeiffer stepped into the CEO position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Canion later admitted he was "burned out" and that the management team probably recognized things later than they should have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## Pfeiffer's Turnaround and the Boom Years

Pfeiffer was seen as having the intensity and drive to take on the clones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. His strategy was simple: make millions of low-cost PCs and turn it into a volume game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Months after becoming CEO, Pfeiffer launched a price war, cutting prices across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. In June 1992, he unveiled 16 new products, including the low-cost ProLinea desktop and Contura laptop lines, which were fast-tracked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. The cheapest 386 Compaq was 50% cheaper in 1992 compared to 1991, and ProLinea desktops quickly became best-sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

Pfeiffer also expanded distribution by signing deals with large computer superstores focused on home consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. Compaq's R&D spend increased to $173 million in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. Compaq's ads highlighted this R&D, stating, "at most other computer companies, R&D stands for 'Replicate and Duplicate'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. The company also struck deals with system integrators like EDS to service large corporate clients, though it continued to rely heavily on PC distributors and retailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

Pfeiffer oversaw a remarkably fast turnaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. In 1992, Compaq sold 150% more computers than in 1991, with revenues rising to $4.1 billion (up 25%) and net profits growing to $213 million (up 63%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. The turnaround continued in 1993, with factories ramping up to 7 days a week, and a new factory established in Shenzhen, China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.

In August 1993, Compaq introduced the Presario, an all-in-one computer line for the home and home office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. The Presario, tailored for novices, became a massive hit and Compaq's new best-selling line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. In 1993, Compaq's revenue jumped from $4 billion to $7 billion, with profits reaching $867 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. By 1995, Compaq's sales hit $14.9 billion, leapfrogging IBM and Apple to become the world's largest PC maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

## A Vision and a Problem

Compaq's victory in 1995 marked the end of easy growth in the home and home office PC market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Competition intensified, particularly from Dell, whose direct-selling model began to eat into Compaq's market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Compaq's historical dependence on external distributors and retailers, while allowing sales in over 100 countries, prevented it from easily adopting Dell's direct-selling model due to fear of alienating partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

In March 1996, Compaq warned of missing earnings, forcing further price cuts and resulting in razor-thin 20% margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. Pfeiffer believed Compaq's only way forward was to grow beyond mere PCs into a global computer services company, similar to IBM, with a goal of $50 billion in revenue by 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.

### Unfortunate Acquisitions
This vision led to a series of [[compaqs_acquisitions_and_strategic_decisions | unfortunate acquisitions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. Substantial money was spent on building a networking business, including Networth (1995) and Microcom (1997) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. In June 1997, Compaq paid $4 billion for Tandem Computer Incorporated, specialists in fault-tolerant computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

The biggest acquisition came in January 1998, when Compaq paid a record $9.6 billion for Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), turning Compaq into a $38 billion giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. While analysts noted DEC's cash reserves, tax assets, and valuable services business, its core high-end server and workstation businesses struggled against cheaper Unix competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. Pfeiffer struggled to bridge the two company cultures, and DEC's significant technical assets, such as its Alpha microprocessor and AltaVista search engine, were largely uncapitalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

Meanwhile, Compaq's core PC business continued to deteriorate. It wasn't until 1998 that Compaq finally began adopting Dell's direct-sales model to close a 10-15% cost advantage, but it was too little, too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. By September 1999, Dell overtook Compaq as the leading PC seller in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[impact_and_legacy_of_compaq_within_the_pc_industry | role that Compaq played in leading the fight]] against IBM is largely forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. The narrative often skips directly from IBM to Microsoft and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>. This is partly due to the massive commoditization of the PC industry in the late 1990s, which was vastly destructive to American PC-maker companies and manufacturing in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. While the commoditization of the PC business seemed inevitable, it fundamentally changed the landscape Compaq had helped create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.

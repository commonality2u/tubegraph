The [[nissan_and_honda_merger | proposed merger between Nissan and Honda]] in late December 2024 is described as an effort by the Japanese government to save a "spiraling company left behind by the times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Nissan's history has been volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This current downturn appears to be a definitive moment for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. A significant factor in Nissan's struggles and its current state is the complex and often strained relationship with its alliance partner, Renault, marked by deep cultural and geopolitical tensions.

## The Uneven Alliance Formation

In May 1999, Renault, a state-owned company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, invested 5 billion euros into the struggling Japanese carmaker Nissan, acquiring 36.8% of Nissan's shares with an option for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This move was met with skepticism, with some believing Nissan was beyond saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. [[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Carlos Ghosn]], known as "Le Cost Killer" for his work at Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, was brought in as Nissan's new COO to turn the company around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. By 2002, Nissan returned to profitability ahead of schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

In 2002, Renault increased its stake in Nissan to 43% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Nissan acquired a 15% stake in Renault, but crucially, without equivalent voting capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This unequal arrangement would become a source of "simmering cultural and geopolitical tensions" within the Alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

## Attempts at Integration and Resistance

[[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Ghosn]] aimed for closer ties between the two companies, particularly in manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. By 2008, they collaborated on building a plant in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. After a 2011 announcement, he pushed engineers to work more closely by cutting individual budgets to force collaboration and appointing managers with responsibilities in both companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. His goal was to have 70% of the Alliance's cars made from one of three common platforms by 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

However, these integration attempts faced significant resistance:
*   **Cultural differences in product development**: While Nissan developed the Leaf EV, Renault developed its ZOE EV, with almost no commonality, including the battery, due to a failure to agree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. This led to lost time and momentum as the resulting cars were too expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Engineer pushback**: Car engineers "bristled" at the idea of common platforms, perceiving them as "soulless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. A former Japanese union leader noted that the integration of components (powertrain, transmission) made people question if the car's identity was at stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   **Perceived uneven shareholding**: Nissan felt the arrangement was unfair, with the smaller Renault having voting power over Nissan but not vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Nissan believed it was increasingly propping up Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a> and sought to fix this to achieve a "true partnership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Renault, however, viewed the shareholding as a matter of contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## Geopolitical Interference

The close ties between both companies and their respective governments meant these tensions had geopolitical implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Notably, in 2015, the French [[government_policies_and_the_automotive_industry | government]] increased its stake in Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, which threatened Nissan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. This led to a "kerfuffle" and a "face-saving agreement" that the French [[government_policies_and_the_automotive_industry | government]] would not interfere in Nissan's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

## [[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Ghosn]]'s Downfall and Alliance Restructuring

The culmination of [[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Ghosn]]'s controversial pay, his prolonged tenure, his lavish lifestyle, and the ongoing tensions over a potential forced merger ultimately contributed to his downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. Internal auditors discovered that Nissan had purchased residences in Lebanon and Brazil for [[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Ghosn]]'s personal use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. This internal team went directly to law enforcement, and Nissan's board was not informed until the news broke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

In November 2018, [[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Carlos Ghosn]] was arrested in Japan, stripped of his positions, and charged with underreporting his income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. He later fled to Lebanon, claiming he was escaping a rigged justice system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. The SEC alleged that [[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Ghosn]] and his team worked to raise and conceal his compensation by up to $140 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

[[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Ghosn]]'s abrupt departure disrupted the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. Nissan struggled from 2019 to 2021, making efforts to cut jobs, close factories, and reset incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. A major goal was to reset its unequal shareholding relationship with Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. After significant internal infighting, the final deal was sealed in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>, forcing out a COO and two directors who objected to the agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. This deal trimmed Renault's stake in Nissan to 15% and gave Nissan voting rights for its 15% stake in Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

## Conclusion

The enduring [[challenges_facing_nissan_in_the_automotive_industry | challenges facing Nissan]], exacerbated by the internal and geopolitical tensions with Renault, contributed to its current precarious position. Nissan's CEO Makoto Uchida acknowledged that [[impact_of_the_chinese_ev_market_on_nissan | China was a "wake-up call"]], and the company faces a "massive challenge" in rolling out electric vehicles in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. As Nissan's sales plummeted in China, its top market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, senior management was "fiddling while Rome burns" with the share deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

The abrupt [[nissan_and_honda_merger | tie-up with Honda]] was initiated partly due to concerns that Taiwanese giant Foxconn might try to buy into Nissan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. However, Honda is reportedly not enthusiastic about dealing with Nissan's ongoing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>, including an aging lineup and a lopsided cost situation where Japan accounts for less than 20% of car production but almost half the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. Honda's CEO famously described partnering with Nissan as "That's a difficult one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. The future of Nissan as an independent entity appears to be nearing its end, whether the [[nissan_and_honda_merger | merger with Honda]] proceeds or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

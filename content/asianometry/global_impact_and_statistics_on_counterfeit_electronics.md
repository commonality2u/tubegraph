In 2020, an F-16 ejection seat malfunctioned, resulting in the pilot's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. An investigation of the seat's sequencer revealed that several microchips inside were [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | counterfeit or fake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While the specific role of these chips in this incident remains unclear (the sequencer also needed maintenance), it highlights the significant risk [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | fake chips]] pose in critical situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Defining Counterfeit Semiconductors

A [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | counterfeit semiconductor]] can be broadly defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The Department of Defense offers two simple definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>:
1.  A previously used electronic part sold as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
2.  Unauthorized copies of an authentic electronic product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The industry provides a more comprehensive taxonomy for a [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | counterfeit semiconductor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>:
*   It is an unauthorized copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   It does not conform to the original manufacturer's design, model, or performance standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   It is not produced by the original manufacturer or its authorized contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   It is off-specification, already used, defective, or misleadingly labeled as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   It is incorrectly marked or has wrong documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Global Scale and Statistics

[[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | Counterfeit semiconductors]] represent a significant illegal business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Tracking illegal activities is challenging, and data is often not up-to-date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Organizations often discuss this as part of a larger piracy and counterfeit trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

*   In 2019, the OECD estimated that the global volume of counterfeit and pirated products accounted for up to 3.3% of total global trade, or over $500 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   The government's Counterfeit Parts Database (GIDEP) is not anonymous, which discourages victims from reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   The Electronic Resellers Association International (ERAi) tracks incidents reported by buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   In 2022, they noted 504 reported [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | semiconductor counterfeit]] cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   This was a sharp drop from 963 in 2021 and 7,114 in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   In November 2011, a U.S. Congressional committee's investigation into [[Counterfeit Chips in the Defense Sector | counterfeit electronic parts in the military supply chain]] cited an estimate from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
    *   Counterfeiting cost the American semiconductor manufacturing industry over $7.5 billion a year in lost revenue and 11,000 jobs in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   A 2010 report by the Bureau of Industry Security (Department of Commerce) identified 7,114 detected [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | counterfeited micro circuit incidents]] across 387 companies within the [[Counterfeit Chips in the Defense Sector | defense industry]] in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This was a significant increase from 3,400 reported incidents in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   The types of [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | counterfeited semiconductors]] vary widely, including microprocessors, analog chips, memory, and radio frequency chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Their resale value ranged from as low as 11 cents to as high as $500, with most falling into the 11 cents to $10 range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Case Study: P-8A Poseidon Incident

During the 2011 Congressional hearing, several incidents of [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | counterfeit semiconductors]] entering [[Counterfeit Chips in the Defense Sector | military supply chains]] were discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. One case involved the P-8A Poseidon plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   An ice detection module on the plane, which warns pilots about ice formation, contained a component that identified itself as a Xilinx FPGA unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. However, this was a [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | counterfeit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   Boeing discovered the issue when the part literally fell out of its socket and rattled around inside the module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   BAE, the module's manufacturer, had purchased 300 such FPGAs from a California company that tested only 50 of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   Investigators traced the [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | counterfeit chip]] back to an affiliate of an electronics manufacturer in Shenzhen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Challenges for Contractors and Suppliers

Defense Department contractors and commercial system integrators face a difficult situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   They often need to use old parts for repair and maintenance, as original manufacturers may have ceased production years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. For example, the F-15 plane was introduced over 45 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This forces them to turn to "oft shady secondhand supplier[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   The U.S. government places the onus of [[detection_and_prevention_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | detecting and filtering out these counterfeit chips]] on the contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The National Defense Authorization Act, signed in 2013, threatens contractors with civil and criminal penalties for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   A notable case involved Vision Tech in Florida, which knowingly sold [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | fake chips]] as trademarked [[Counterfeit Chips in the Defense Sector | military-grade goods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Employees were instructed to claim chips came from Europe despite knowing they originated from China and Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. They also sent legitimate samples but [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | fake chips]] for purchased shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The company made nearly $16 million from these sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, and the administrative manager received a 38-month prison sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Methods of Counterfeiting

### Recycling
[[challenges_in_recycling_and_sourcing_electronic_components | Recycling]] is one of the most common ways [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | counterfeit chips]] enter the supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   Workers receive scrap electronics, remove printed circuit boards, and heat them over an open flame to melt solder and loosen components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   Components are then bashed to make them fall out, their original markings removed, and then sorted and reprocessed with new coatings and markings to appear new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   These [[challenges_in_recycling_and_sourcing_electronic_components | E-Waste]] components are already old and worn, and the harvesting process subjects them to further damage and stress, often rendering them non-functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Relabeled or Remarked Chips
These are chips that misrepresent their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Markings contain information about a chip's model, origin, and certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Changing these markings misleads users about the chip's capability and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. A bad actor acquires chips, wipes their markings, and adds new ones to make them appear more premium or expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

This has serious consequences, especially for components needing enhanced specifications, such as [[Counterfeit Chips in the Defense Sector | military components]] that must be hardened against radiation or temperature damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Suppliers might swap in cheaper commercial parts that appear similar but do not meet the hardening requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
Together, [[challenges_in_recycling_and_sourcing_electronic_components | recycling]] and remarking constitute about 80% of total counterfeiting incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Overproduction by Foundries
Most semiconductor companies contract overseas foundries, often operating without third-party oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Some foundries might produce more chips than contracted for, either for yield reasons or to resell the extra production as [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | counterfeits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This allows the foundry to profit from a valuable design without the R&D investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Unauthorized Clones
Unauthorized clones are similar to foundry overproduction but originate from a third party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. These third parties clone chips to save on expensive R&D for developing their own designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   Design IP can be obtained through reverse engineering, such as using an electron microscope to analyze a chip's layers, though this is difficult for complex chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   Another method is illegally acquiring the chip's design IP at various stages of the design and manufacturing process, such as copying RTL code at a design house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   Clone [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | semiconductor counterfeits]] are harder to detect as they are functionally similar to the real thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. However, many cloned or reverse-engineered chips deviate from the original in technology and process, leading to erratic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Detection and Prevention

[[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | Fake chips]] often enter products because contractors lack documented supply chain history or fail to conduct thorough inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The P-8A Poseidon incident exemplifies this, where the California-based supplier should have more closely inspected the FPGAs from their Chinese supplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

[[detection_and_prevention_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | Inspecting potentially counterfeit chips]] involves two main types of methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>:

### Physical Methods
These look for defects directly related to the chip's physical properties, including its exterior, shipping/packaging, connections, IC packaging, bonding wires, or die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Techniques include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>:
*   External Visual Inspection (EVI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   More invasive methods like X-ray or de-capping the chip to expose its internal components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Some methods are destructive and cannot always be performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Electrical Methods
These tests check for changes in the chip's component parameters (parametric tests) or whether the chip functions properly (functional tests) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. While effective, these tests are time-consuming and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Challenges in Detection
[[detection_and_prevention_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | Detecting counterfeits]] presents nuanced challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. For example, distinguishing normal physical defects from signs of sanding procedures to remove previous markings is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. A balance must be struck between detection and financial and time concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Best practices involve designing a set of tests for high confidence rather than total assurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Designed for Counterfeit Measures
With [[challenges_in_recycling_and_sourcing_electronic_components | recycling]] being a significant problem and package remarking becoming harder to detect, designers can add [[detection_and_prevention_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | new features into their chip designs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. These are called "[[detection_and_prevention_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | designed for counterfeit measures]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   A simple measure is to give a chip a unique ID programmed into non-programmable memory, easily readable throughout its lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   Another method is to create a unique fingerprint for the chip called a Physical Unclonable Feature (PUF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. An example uses random variables in the semiconductor fabrication process to create an Arbiter PUF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. A signal (challenge) sent through the circuit produces a random yet repeatable output, like a Google Authenticator app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   However, [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | counterfeits]] can still tamper with these methods, or they might be prohibitively difficult to implement due to cost or technical reasons (e.g., lack of space on a chip) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## Root Causes and Geographic Shifts

Most [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | counterfeit chips]], especially [[challenges_in_recycling_and_sourcing_electronic_components | recycled]] ones, enter the supply chain due to opportunity and incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   In 2019, only 17.4% of the world's [[challenges_in_recycling_and_sourcing_electronic_components | electronic waste]] was documented as collected and [[challenges_in_recycling_and_sourcing_electronic_components | recycled]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This [[challenges_in_recycling_and_sourcing_electronic_components | e-waste]] is often harvested to produce [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | fake semiconductor components]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   Harvesting and desoldering old chips from [[challenges_in_recycling_and_sourcing_electronic_components | e-waste]] can cost as little as 10 cents per chip, while certain types of chips can sell for $1 to $10, or even 100 times the harvesting cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This provides a significant profit for laborers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
*   The problem is exacerbated by massive imports of improperly managed [[challenges_in_recycling_and_sourcing_electronic_components | e-waste]] from developed areas like the United States and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

Throughout the 2010s, most [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | fake recycled and relabeled chips]] originated from China, where most [[challenges_in_recycling_and_sourcing_electronic_components | e-waste]] was sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. However, in 2017, China banned the import of 24 types of solid waste, including plastic and [[challenges_in_recycling_and_sourcing_electronic_components | e-waste]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. While some [[challenges_in_recycling_and_sourcing_electronic_components | e-waste]] is still smuggled into China, significant imports have been redirected to new countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. For example, Thailand saw a 5.7 times increase in [[challenges_in_recycling_and_sourcing_electronic_components | e-waste]] imports in 2017 after China's bans were implemented, rising from 9,312 to 53,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

## Conclusion

The modern world relies on semiconductors to function properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Whether in a soldier's equipment, a plane component, or a car's brakes, a chip that is not what it claims to be can cause serious harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

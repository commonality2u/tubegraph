The Soviet space program, particularly its Mars missions, was profoundly shaped by political directives and the intense [[competition_between_soviet_union_and_united_states_in_space_exploration | competition with the United States]] in the [[historical_space_race_between_us_and_ussr | space race]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This political imperative led to both significant resource allocation and, at times, detrimental operational decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>.

## Early Directives and Ambition
In 1950, Joseph Stalin demanded a missile capable of striking Western enemies, leading to Sergey Korolev's work on the R7 missile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. After Stalin's death, the political climate eased, allowing Korolev to pursue his dream of space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The success of Sputnik in October 1957 created an unexpected "hubbub" and allowed Korolev and his team to capitalize on the Soviet Union's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This led to ambitious proposals for a vast new program to send robot spacecraft to Mars and Venus, and eventually people, with a final step of establishing colonies on these planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Khrushchev's Demands and Rushed Programs
By January 1960, Nikita Khrushchev expressed concern about the growing American space program and pressed Korolev for launches to Mars and Venus within the 1960 orbital window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This political demand forced Korolev's team to rapidly develop the new four-stage Molniya rocket and the 1M spacecraft from scratch, leading to rushed production and assembly issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This "crash effort" resulted in the failure of both 1M launches, with one breaking up over Eastern Siberia and the other due to a frozen kerosene leak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Khrushchev had even prepared models of the Mars craft as "bragging gifts" for U.S. President Eisenhower, which were never given due to the failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Pressure during the Cuban Missile Crisis
During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, the political tension directly impacted the Mars program. A spacecraft being readied for a Mars launch at the Baikonur Spaceport, which shared two launch pads with military ICBMs, had to be removed to make way for an ICBM due to a "National Emergency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Launch personnel were surrounded by soldiers with machine guns, anticipating a U.S. thermonuclear strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Despite the crisis, the Mars probe (Sputnik 22) was eventually launched, but it failed in Earth orbit due to a recurring issue with the fourth stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. A warning station in Wyoming initially picked up its debris as a "swarm of nuclear missiles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Shifting Priorities: The Moon Race and Managerial Chaos
The success of Mariner 4 and the realization that Americans were serious about a manned Moon landing further intensified political pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. In August 1964, the Politburo directed Korolev and his teams to also send a man to the Moon, putting them into direct [[competition_between_soviet_union_and_united_states_in_space_exploration | competition]] with the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. This shift threw the Soviet space program's plans "out the window," resulting in "managerial chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Korolev's focus shifted to the Moon mission, and in March 1965, the Mars robot program was reassigned to a new firm, Lavochkin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

## Extreme Pressure for the M69 Missions
The Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued a special military-industrial resolution, making it "absolutely clear" that the 1969 Mars launch date had to be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

> "Failing such a resolution had unpleasant consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

The Central Committee demanded weekly updates and managers were called to explain missed deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. Underperforming suppliers and individuals were blacklisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Divisions worked "around the clock," with specialists picked up from their beds at night for troubleshooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Workers received no overtime pay, their efforts considered "enthusiasm for the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

Despite this intense pressure, both M69 probes failed in March and April 1969 due to rocket failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. This "mass of political pressure" was seen as having "come back to haunt them" and "exactly the wrong way to run a space program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. The bitter taste of defeat was worsened by the successful Apollo 11 Moon landing in July 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

## 1971 Missions and The Data Dilemma
For the 1971 Mars launch window, the failure of M69 meant engineers lacked crucial atmospheric data for soft landings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. Faced with the choice of redoing M69 for data (and delaying Landers to 1973) or sending Landers now without data, the decision was made to send three probes: an Orbiter (Mars 71s) to gather data first, followed by two Landers (Mars 71p) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. The Mars 71s Orbiter was designed to reach Mars first to "score a propaganda win" against the American Mariner 8 and 9 missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

Despite the pressure, an "unforgivable mistake" in coding the launch sequence for the Mars 71s Orbiter caused it to fail, leaving the two Landers without the crucial atmospheric data needed for a controlled ballistic entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.

## The All-Out Assault of 1973
Even before the full results of the 1971 mission were known, the Soviet leadership planned an "all-out assault on Mars" for the 1973 launch window to "boot the Americans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. This plan expanded to two orbiters and two landers, even though the 1973 window was less ideal, requiring more speed and fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

A critical flaw was discovered in the transistors used throughout all four spacecraft, with engineers estimating a "50/50 chance" of catastrophic failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. However, the ministry decided to proceed with the launch, as "delaying the mission would have been a political shame show," especially with [[competition_between_soviet_union_and_united_states_in_space_exploration | Viking]] looming in 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>. The engineers' fears came true, with Mars 4 failing to orbit and Mars 7's Lander missing the planet, both likely due to transistor failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>.

## Outcomes and Legacy
The 1973 "all-out assault" on Mars was largely considered a failure by leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>. The program's chief designer, Vasili Mishin, was dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>. This led to a pivot away from planetary exploration, with fewer resources allocated to the Soviet planetary space program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.

In conclusion, the Soviet Mars program was defined by its political importance due to [[competition_between_soviet_union_and_united_states_in_space_exploration | competition with the United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. While this granted substantial resources, the "arduous political requirements," limited launch windows, poor execution stemming from rushed development, and bad luck ultimately foiled Soviet success on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>.

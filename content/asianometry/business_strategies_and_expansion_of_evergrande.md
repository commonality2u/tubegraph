[[history_and_background_of_evergrande_group | Evergrande Group]], a sprawling company with billions of dollars in [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | debt]], has faced a significant cash crunch, leading to widespread interest in how a real estate firm grew so rapidly [00:00:06]. Once China's largest real estate conglomerate, it now faces 300 billion dollars in [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | liabilities]] [00:00:33].

## Founder: Xu Jiayin's Early Life and Career

Xu Jiayin, Evergrande's founder and until recently its chairman, was born in 1958, the son of a farmer and a veteran of the Second Sino-Japanese War [00:01:05]. His mother passed away when he was eight months old due to lack of money for medical treatment [00:01:17].

After graduating high school in 1974, Xu set up his first business selling building materials because college entrance exams were closed [00:01:27]. He then held various rural jobs, including cement factory worker, village security officer, and tractor driver [00:01:37]. In 1978, he ranked third out of 10 million students in the *gaokao* (college entrance exam) on his second attempt, securing him entrance into Wuhan University of Science and Technology, where he graduated with honors [00:01:44].

Upon graduation, he married Yang Huaying, who shared a similarly impoverished background [00:02:00]. Xu worked at the Ganan Wuyang Iron and Steel Company as an assistant director, overseeing over 300 employees and raising the workshop's profile with high performance [00:02:08]. After 10 years, he left following an investigation into selling scrap metal in his downtime, which he claimed was to clear the floor and earn more money for his workers [00:02:32].

He then joined Shenzhen Dongdak Group as a salesperson, quickly rising to office director [00:02:51]. Xu proved to be a "go-getter," making an immediate impact by shepherding a steel trading alliance with his former company and implementing a double salary system for top workers [00:03:00].

## Entry into Real Estate and Founding Evergrande

In 1994, Xu pushed Dongdak Group to enter the real estate market [00:03:18]. With company approval, he moved to Guangzhou with four workers to develop a project called Du Dao Garden (Pearl Island Garden) [00:03:23]. They distinguished themselves with a low-cost, high-value design, making premium real estate accessible to the middle class [00:03:49]. By mid-1997, Pearl Island Garden generated a profit of 31 million dollars for Dongdak [00:04:03]. Despite this success, Xu's salary was only $450 a month, and after his request for a raise was rejected, he left [00:04:14].

In 1997, at approximately 39 years old, Xu founded Evergrande Industrial Group in Guangzhou [00:04:32]. The Chinese name, like its English counterpart, means "endless from the past into the present" [00:04:45].

### Early Strategy and Rapid Growth
With just eight employees, Xu competed with major Chinese developers like Vanke, Dalian Wanda, and Country Garden to acquire land [00:04:53]. His first project, Jinbe Garden, was built on the site of an old pesticide plant with pollution issues [00:05:14]. However, these problems allowed Xu to acquire the 110,000 square meter plot at an extremely low price [00:05:28].

Evergrande initially struggled to afford the 5 million RMB down payment but convinced the government to allow installments [00:05:44]. This marked the beginning of Evergrande's reliance on debt; they borrowed 6 million RMB, using 5 million for the down payment and 1 million to kick off construction [00:05:55].

Jinbe Garden broke ground in June 1997, and by August, the first housing sales opened [00:06:10]. Units were sold below cost at 2800 RMB per square meter, leading to a sales sensation where all units sold out in two hours [00:06:20]. This generated 80 million RMB (12 million USD) in sales, providing the company with its "first bucket of gold" [00:06:40].

Evergrande immediately began developing 13 other projects simultaneously in Guangzhou [00:06:50]. By 1999, just two years after its founding, Evergrande was Guangzhou's seventh-largest real estate company [00:06:58]. They refined their internal procedures and business model before embarking on a national expansion in 2006, deploying 200 employees to cities like Wuhan, Shenyang, Chongqing, and Chengdu with the goal of recreating 20 Evergrandes in three years [00:07:06].

### The "Three Highs, One Low" Strategy
Evergrande's early growth strategy, implemented from Jinbe Garden onwards, was encapsulated by the slogan *san gao yidi* [00:07:41].

> "Three highs, one low" [00:08:24]
> *   High debt [00:08:33]
> *   High leverage [00:08:34]
> *   High turnover [00:08:35]
> *   Low cost [00:08:37]

This approach involved acquiring land through debt, quickly building small units in previously undesirable areas, pricing them for the middle class, and selling them rapidly to repay initial investments [00:07:51]. Sales from each round were then reinvested into more land purchases and development [00:08:14]. This reliance on high [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | debt]] meant the company was always "teetering on a razor's edge" [00:08:41]. However, as long as land prices kept rising, the company could stay ahead of its [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | debt]] costs [00:08:56].

### Understanding Liabilities
It's important to understand the nature of Evergrande's [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | liabilities]]. While bonds and borrowings make up a portion, a significant amount comes from customer deposits for future homes [00:09:02]. Unlike bank deposits (as with JPMorgan Chase), these customer deposits are not insured and carry a much higher risk of forced withdrawal [00:09:40]. Furthermore, over 50% of Evergrande's [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | debt]] was classified as "current," meaning it could be called for repayment within a year [00:10:11]. In contrast, JPMorgan Chase, with vastly more assets, had a tiny fraction of its [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | liabilities]] as current [00:10:23]. This exposed Evergrande to significant risk during periods when it needed to generate cash to pay current [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | liabilities]] [00:10:32].

## Navigating the 2008 Global Financial Crisis

The 2008 global financial crisis sparked fears of a real estate crisis in China, placing Evergrande in "turbulent waters" [00:10:46]. At this time, the company was in the midst of its national expansion, spending heavily to acquire valuable land plots in China's first and second-tier cities, growing its land bank nine times over since 2006 [00:10:55]. With around 37 projects underway, Evergrande faced cash flow problems and owed 12 to 15 billion RMB (2 billion USD) [00:11:10].

Evergrande's initial plan to manage this [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | debt]] was to go public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange [00:11:26]. However, the crisis thwarted this, forcing Xu to seek alternative funding [00:11:32]. After being turned down by Wang Shi of Vanke, Xu approached Cheng Yu-tung of Chao Tai Fook Group, one of Hong Kong's wealthiest business families [00:11:40]. Cheng invested over 150 million USD as the lead investor in a pre-IPO 500 million USD investment round to bail out Evergrande [00:12:11]. Other investors included Deutsche Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and the Kuwait Investment Authority [00:12:24]. This investment stabilized the company and allowed projects to continue [00:12:30].

In November 2009, Evergrande's IPO proceeded in Hong Kong, with shares rising 34% on the first day [00:12:35]. Xu held a 68% stake, valuing his net worth at over 6 billion USD based on the company's 10 billion USD valuation [00:12:43]. By the end of 2009, Evergrande had total assets of 63 billion RMB (9.8 billion USD) against 50 billion RMB (7.8 billion USD) in total [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | liabilities]], still operating on a "razor's edge" [00:12:56].

## Diversification Efforts

Xu Jiayin clearly aimed to build an empire beyond real estate [00:13:12].

### Guangzhou Football Club
A year after the IPO, Evergrande acquired the Guangzhou Football Club (soccer club) for 100 million RMB (15 million USD) [00:13:16]. Evergrande stabilized the club's ownership and brought it great success, including seven straight Chinese Super League championships and the Asian Champions League title in 2013, the first Chinese team to do so in 23 years [00:13:28].

### Consumer Goods: Mineral Water and Food
During the 2013 Asian Champions League event, Evergrande formally entered the consumer goods industry with its mineral water product, Evergrande Bingquan [00:13:45]. Marketing claimed the water came from deep mineral springs of Changbai Mountain [00:13:52]. Xu set ambitious sales targets for Ice Spring: 1.5 billion USD in 2014 and 4.6 billion USD by 2016 [00:14:42]. However, the brand struggled to make a profit despite high gross margins, and outsiders questioned its viability [00:15:02]. In 2016, Evergrande sold its shares in the mineral water business and other food products for 2.7 billion RMB (405 million USD), including the unit's 3.3 billion RMB (510 million USD) in [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | debt]] [00:15:13].

### "Diversity Plus Scale Plus Brand"
In mid-2014, Xu unveiled a new strategy: "diversity plus scale plus brand," aiming to diversify operations beyond real estate [00:15:35]. Three months later, Evergrande acquired Yen-Chen Plastic Surgery, a chain of plastic surgery clinics, with Xu's wife, Yang Huaying, placed in charge [00:15:50]. Other purchases in various sectors followed [00:16:02].

### High-Tech Industry and Electric Vehicles
In 2018, spurred by U.S. sanctions crippling Chinese telecommunications company ZTE, Xu announced Evergrande's entry into the high-tech industry, including quantum computing, AI, life sciences, and new energy vehicles [00:20:21]. After an attempt to acquire American EV company Faraday Future fell through, Evergrande decided to "go it alone" [00:20:56].

In November 2019, Evergrande announced a 45 billion RMB (7 billion USD) investment over three years to develop [[the_rise_of_ev_companies_in_china | electric vehicles]] [00:21:05]. They utilized a pre-existing Hong Kong-listed health company, Evergrande Health Industry Group Limited, and renamed it Evergrande Auto [00:21:16]. This entity was a "Frankenstein's monster" formed by merging a gossip magazine publisher, hospital chains, and plastic surgery clinics [00:21:30]. Despite still operating these diverse businesses, Evergrande Auto aimed to compete with companies like Tesla [00:21:52].

In August 2020, Evergrande Auto unveiled six vehicles under its Hangqi brand, targeting a market launch within a year [00:22:02]. A month later, the company raised 500 million USD from investors, including Tencent, Didi, Sequoia Capital, and Jack Ma's Yunfeng Capital [00:22:17]. They also secured deals with Guanghui Group, China's largest automobile dealer, for a sales network, and State Grid Corporation of China for nationwide charging stations [00:22:31]. The Hong Kong stock surged, valuing the auto subsidiary at nearly 90 billion dollars by April 2021, more than Ford Motors at the time [00:22:49].

This valuation was seen as a bubble, as Evergrande Auto had not sold a single car and was losing billions annually, making more from plastic surgery than EVs [00:23:04]. The company also heavily invested in three production facilities in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou [00:23:24]. Eventually, the stock crashed by over 95% due to the group's larger woes [00:23:38].

## Strategic Shift and Government Ties

In early 2017, Xu Jiayin announced a change in Evergrande's business strategy [00:16:06]. At this time, the company's total [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | liabilities]] had reached 1.15 trillion RMB (178 billion USD) [00:16:13]. The previous "three highs, one low" strategy was replaced with a new one: *sandi yigao* [00:16:40].

> "Three lows, one high" [00:16:51]
> *   Low debt [00:16:54]
> *   Low leverage [00:16:55]
> *   Low cost [00:16:56]
> *   High turnover [00:16:57]

The goal was to lower [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | debt]] ratios and increase net assets, aligning with the Chinese government's pronouncements on de-leveraging the economy [00:16:57]. This shift demonstrates Xu Jiayin's close ties to the government; he is China's most generous individual in terms of charity, winning the China Charity Award for eight consecutive years and donating billions annually [00:17:08]. These ties allowed him to "leverage those ties to sail the winds of trade" [00:17:44].

For instance, in June 2012, Andrew Left of short-selling firm Citron Research published a report claiming Evergrande was insolvent [00:17:56]. Hong Kong authorities launched a years-long civil case against Left, banning him from trading in Hong Kong for five years in 2016 [00:18:08]. Left lost his final appeal in 2019, stating in 2021 that he would "never have gotten into it" if he had known how powerful Xu was [00:18:16].

The 2017 strategy turnaround initiated various [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | debt]] reduction measures, including asset sales and fundraising [00:18:36]. At year-end, the company reported net profits rising 110% to 37 billion RMB (5.7 billion USD) [00:18:45]. However, while some news outlets reported a decline in the net [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | debt]] ratio, total [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | liabilities]] actually rose from 1.1 trillion RMB (170 billion USD) in 2016 to 1.5 trillion RMB (232 billion USD) in 2017 [00:18:56]. Evergrande, now China's most profitable real estate company, made the Fortune 500 ranking for the first time [00:19:32].

## The "Three Red Lines" Policy

The Chinese state financial centers had long worried about contagion threats from massive conglomerates like Evergrande, Fosen Group, and Anbang Insurance Group, which were funded by borrowed money and often off-balance sheet arrangements [00:23:46].

In August 2020, two Chinese ministries, after interviewing 12 real estate companies, passed regulations mandating the "three red lines" [00:24:39]:
1.  A percentage ceiling on the ratio of [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | liabilities]] to assets of 70% (excluding advances from contracted projects) [00:24:52].
2.  A cap on the percentage of net [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | debt]] to equity of 100% [00:25:01].
3.  A requirement to hold at least one dollar of cash for each dollar borrowed in the short term [00:25:05].

Any real estate company failing these requirements would be barred from adding more [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | debt]] [00:25:12]. This punishment was severe for companies reliant on growth to manage [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | debt]] [00:25:22].

Evergrande's metrics at the time the law passed [00:25:27]:
*   [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | Liabilities]] to asset ratio: 82% [00:25:31].
*   Percentage of net [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | debt]] to equity: 199% [00:25:36].
*   Ratio of cash to short-term borrowings: 0.4 [00:25:43].

Xu Jiayin and Evergrande were caught off guard [00:25:57]. Weeks later, Xu announced that Evergrande would slash pricing on its 600+ new builds nationwide by 30% to achieve sales of 100 billion RMB (15.4 billion USD) each month [00:26:02]. While not unfamiliar with such discounts (they offered 78% off during the March 2020 pandemic depths), this indicated significant pressure [00:26:19].

## The Leaked Letter and Financial Turmoil

In September 2020, a Chinese website leaked a letter from Evergrande to the Guangdong provincial government, titled "Report on Requesting Support for Major Asset Restructuring Projects" [00:26:35]. While the company denied its authenticity, the market believed it was real [00:26:50].

The letter emphasized Evergrande's adherence to government policies and casually revealed its interest-bearing [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | liabilities]] had reached about 835 billion RMB (130 billion USD) [00:26:58]. This included 232 billion RMB (35.8 billion USD) owed to 128 domestic banks, with Minsheng Bank and Agricultural Bank of China being the largest creditors [00:27:23]. Additionally, 368 billion RMB (56.9 billion USD) was owed to 121 non-banking entities, with the remainder owed to various domestic and offshore bonds [00:27:41].

The report requested the Guangdong government's help in coordinating a reorganization of Evergrande's entities [00:27:54]. Crucially, if the reorganization wasn't completed by February 2021, Evergrande would owe strategic investors 130 billion RMB (20 billion USD) and 13.7 billion RMB (2.2 billion USD) in dividends [00:28:05]. This posed a risk of a sudden cash flow crunch [00:28:24].

Since then, Evergrande has experienced a flurry of [[impact_and_consequences_of_evergrandes_financial_issues | debt]] downgrades, a 68% drop in shares, and over half its [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | debt]] value lost [00:28:31]. The company sought new funding, and speculation arose about a government bailout [00:28:39].

### Off-Balance Sheet Issues
Evergrande's 2020 annual report showed approximately 1.95 trillion RMB (300 billion USD) in total [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | liabilities]], with assets of 1.9 trillion RMB [00:28:45]. However, much of these assets were in land banks or houses under construction, which were not readily convertible into cash to pay vendors and construction crews [00:29:04].

Additional concerns included obligations from Evergrande Wealth Management fund products [00:29:20]. These high-yielding interest products, largely sold to employees who then resold them to friends and family, amounted to about 40 billion RMB (6.2 billion USD) [00:29:27]. On September 8, 2021, two affiliates missed repayments, leading to protests at Evergrande's headquarters, with people demanding, "Xu Jiayin, return my hard-earned money!" [00:29:42]. Five days later, Evergrande announced repayment options including cash (with a wait), payment in kind (land), or credit for future home purchases [00:30:05].

A significant issue remains the "off-balance sheet" [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | debt]] [00:30:27]. Evergrande Group has subsidiaries where it does not own 51% of the stock, keeping them off the main books [00:30:30]. Yet, these entities present themselves as Evergrande companies, and their [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | debts]] are implicitly backed by the main group through "unspoken agreement" [00:30:38]. The full extent of these hidden [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | liabilities]] is unknown [00:30:45].

## Recent Developments and Outlook

Amidst the turmoil, Xu Jiayin resigned as Evergrande's chairman on August 17, 2021, with Zhao Tanglong stepping up as chairman, general manager, and legal representative [00:30:51].

The situation remains ongoing, but the prevailing sentiment is that the government is unlikely to bail out Evergrande like a bank [00:31:10]. Instead, the company is expected to undergo [[impact_and_consequences_of_evergrandes_financial_issues | debt]] resolution in court and be slowly broken up [00:31:27]. Concerns exist about the [[impact_and_consequences_of_evergrandes_financial_issues | effect]] of Evergrande's winding down on its hundreds of new builds and the broader Chinese real estate markets [00:31:34]. However, lower real estate prices might align with the government's social equality goals [00:31:42].

Overall, non-performing real estate loans across the financial system remain low, suggesting capacity to absorb losses [00:31:50]. The bigger question is whether state [[regulatory_and_government_interactions_with_evergrande | regulators]] can contain the damage from off-balance sheet issues to prevent a systemic crisis of confidence [00:32:01]. Regulators have handled similar massive conglomerates in crisis before, such as Anbang Insurance [00:32:08]. A final question remains if Xu Jiayin will face charges for the disruption caused [00:32:19].

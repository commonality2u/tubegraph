From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 
The People's Republic of Albania was known as Europe's most isolated country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This small Communist nation remarkably managed to align with and then break from three different major Communist powers throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. After its third and final split, Albania aggressively pursued [[albanias_economic_strategies_and_selfreliance | economic self-reliance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, which contributed to it becoming the third poorest country globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Beginnings of Isolation

Albania, a small country in Southeast Europe near the Mediterranean Sea, was historically influenced by foreign powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The Ottoman Turks first invaded in 1388 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, and after being driven out by Skenderbeu, re-occupied the lands by the late 1500s, ruling for another 400 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. In 1912, Albania was a feudal society of about a million people with undeveloped natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Italy gained influence over Albania through a secret treaty in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, and this influence lasted decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

Ahmet Zogu declared himself "King of the Albanians" as King Zog I in 1928 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. He clashed with the Italians, refusing their demands for economic integration and admitting settlers, even adding British officers to counterbalance Italian military presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. However, he couldn't improve the economy, which relied on natural resources like oil and exports of cheese, animal skins, eggs, and livestock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The global economic depression of the 1930s led to deeper Italian influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Italy invaded Albania on April 7, 1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The Albanian people resented the occupation and organized a resistance movement split into two groups: the National Front and the Communist Party of Albania (officially the Albanian Party of Labor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The Communist Party was created in 1941 with the help of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## [[Enver Hoxhas leadership and Stalinist policies | Enver Hoxha's]] Reign and Political Purges

The Communist Party of Albania was led by [[enver_hoxhas_leadership_and_stalinist_policies | Enver Hoxha]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Although an average student, Hoxha showed a talent for politics and a desire for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. He became a Communist at some point before returning to Albania as a teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. At the founding of the Communist Party, Hoxha quickly dominated the Central Committee despite initial plans for collective leadership, and eventually, his peers were jailed or executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Albania was the only country in Central or Eastern Europe "liberated" without Allied help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The Communist Party, following Yugoslav advice, preached national liberation over economic Marxism-Leninism, forming the National Liberation Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. They launched guerrilla attacks, hoping violent reprisals would radicalize more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. An agreement between the Nationalists and Communists in August 1943, the Mukje agreement, quickly fell apart due to disagreements over fighting for an ethnic Albanian country, particularly regarding Kosovo, which was part of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This spiraled into violence, with Communists attacking Nationalists, who then allied with Germany in September 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This discredited the Nationalists, and the Communists marched into the capital in November 1944, winning the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

After the war, Hoxha's provisional government immediately purged opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Koci Xoxe, Minister of the Interior, led brutal purges targeting elites, anti-communists, and "enemies of the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Sham tribunals led to nearly 2,000 executions and others were sent to 39 newly built jails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. The Sigurimi, the secret police, had over 200,000 workers at its peak, maintaining millions of files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Yugoslavia recognized Hoxha's government in April 1945, followed by the Soviet Union later that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. In December 1945, "free" elections were held where Communists, as the only candidates, won 90% of the vote, and a month later, Hoxha abolished the monarchy and declared the country a "People's Republic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## [[Relations with other Communist powers | Shifting Alliances and Deepening Isolation]]

### Break with Yugoslavia
The Communist Party of Yugoslavia, which helped found Albania's Communist Party and provided military assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, pushed Albania to join the Yugoslav Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Yugoslavia and Albania signed close technical and economic agreements, coordinating monetary systems and education, and forming joint ventures to exploit Albanian natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Albania supplied raw materials to Yugoslavia, which sold industrial goods back at inflated prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

In June 1947, Yugoslavia began publicly attacking Hoxha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Stalin, concerned by Yugoslavia's determination to acquire Albania, turned against Tito <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. In April 1948, the Soviets guaranteed they would not allow a Yugoslav attack on Albania and granted Hoxha a free hand to purge pro-Yugoslav influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This saved Hoxha, leading to the abrupt stripping of titles and arrest of Koci Xoxe, who was condemned to death in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. "Liquidations" continued throughout Hoxha's 46-year rule, with 5,037 men and 450 women executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### Alignment with Soviet Union and Stalinist Policies
After 1948, Albania severed ties with Yugoslavia and joined [[role_of_comecon_and_soviet_influence_on_bulgaria | COMECON]], entering the Soviet orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. From 1949 to 1951, all of Albania's trade was with [[role_of_comecon_and_soviet_influence_on_bulgaria | COMECON]] states, with the Soviet Union accounting for half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. The Soviets provided approximately $200 million in food and military aid between 1948 and 1960, transferred technologies, and built airfields and a submarine base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

Hoxha developed immense personal admiration for Stalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>, even publishing a book about their meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Hoxha was genuine in his fervor for a [[enver_hoxhas_leadership_and_stalinist_policies | Stalinist economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
[[enver_hoxhas_leadership_and_stalinist_policies | Stalinist policies]] involve a centrally planned socialist economy, with the government deciding all economic aspects through 5-year plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Policy emphasized agricultural collectivization and rapid heavy industry build-up at the expense of consumer products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. By 1956, there were 696 collective farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. The first 5-Year Plan, completed in 1951, set all prices, production levels, investment, and wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. This created contradictions and shortages; employment was guaranteed, but job choice was absent, and failure to meet goals led to labor camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Despite official claims of quotas being met, people ate less meat in 1953 than in 1949, and food rationing continued until 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

### Break with Soviet Union
Stalin's death in 1953 deeply affected Hoxha, who orchestrated a public oath of eternal allegiance to the "beloved father" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. However, Nikita Khrushchev's new policies, including repudiation of the Stalin cult of personality and reconciliation with Marshal Tito, grated on Hoxha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

Albania began aligning with the People's Republic of China, another major Communist power at odds with Khrushchev, as early as October 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. After a meeting between Hoxha and Mao Zedong in September 1956, Chinese aid to Albania increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. As the Sino-Soviet Split widened, Albania's close ties with China became untenable for the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. The situation escalated in November 1960 when Hoxha criticized Khrushchev in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. In February 1961, Hoxha launched an economic campaign defying Soviet advice, leading to the withdrawal of Soviet aid in April 1961, which constituted 50% of Albania's economy from 1946 to 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.

In October 1961, Khrushchev publicly called Hoxha an "unreconstructed Stalinist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. The Soviets insisted on airing their grievances, blaming Albanians for spurning reconciliation attempts and accusing Hoxha and the Albanian police of sabotaging relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Khrushchev correctly stated that Hoxha did not want to extinguish the cult of personality because it meant giving up personal power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. TASS issued an official statement asserting that "the Albanian leaders rule through arbitrary power and violence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. The Albanians retaliated, calling Khrushchev a "revisionist" and "anti-Marxist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. Hoxha's fiery speech in November 1961 denounced Khrushchev's "peaceful coexistence" policy and de-Stalinization, affirming Stalin as a true follower of Lenin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. In response to Khrushchev's barb about "pieces of silver," Hoxha famously declared, "The Albanian people and their Party of Labor will even live on grass if need be, but they will never sell themselves 'for 30 pieces of silver'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. Consequently, the Soviet Union and its allies expelled Albania from the Warsaw Pact and [[role_of_comecon_and_soviet_influence_on_bulgaria | COMECON]], leaving China as their only significant ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

### Break with China
China attempted to replace Soviet aid, sending technicians and advisors whom Albanians received favorably due to less strict loan terms and comparable salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. China, then also isolated, considered Albania a staunch ally, with Mao Zedong in November 1966 calling Albania "the only beacon of true socialism left in Europe" and promising to defend it from attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. However, China was a developing country experiencing famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>, and geographical distance caused delays in aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. Chinese aid struggled to replace Soviet losses, making the 1961-1965 period challenging for Communist Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.

China's overtures to the West starting in 1969 created a wedge with Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. US President Nixon's announced trip to China in July 1971 shocked Albanians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. China also told Albania behind the scenes that aid would not continue indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. Hoxha responded with a formal message calling Nixon an anti-Communist and any meeting with him revisionist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. In 1976, he purged military and Party members for pro-Chinese leanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. After Mao's death in 1976 and Tito's invitation to Beijing in 1977, Albania ramped up rhetorical attacks on China, calling them collaborators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>. In July 1978, China cut off all aid, which then constituted half of Albania's economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

## [[Albanias economic strategies and selfreliance | Self-Reliance]] and Economic Isolation

With intensifying shortages in the mid-1960s, the Party focused on [[albanias_economic_strategies_and_selfreliance | self-reliance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. After cutting ties with China, the government promoted a narrative of being special and targeted by imperialist foreign powers through "economic blockades and encirclement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. Hoxha declared Albania the only country still building socialism, enshrining the principle of [[albanias_economic_strategies_and_selfreliance | self-reliance]] in the 1976 Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. For 12 years, the country operated without foreign aid or credit, and Albanian companies were forbidden from joint ventures with foreign countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.

Hoxha's cult of personality intensified, with him being called the father of the nation and a second Skenderbeu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Religion was banned, and travel abroad was forbidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

Key aspects of this policy included:
1.  **Increased Exports:** Albania boosted exports of oil, chrome ore, copper, and electricity to acquire hard currency for investment goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. Trade partners were diversified, including a semi-relaxation of relations with Yugoslavia and [[role_of_comecon_and_soviet_influence_on_bulgaria | COMECON]] (excluding the Soviet Union) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.
2.  **Controlled Data:** Economic data was tightly controlled; only positive data was released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
3.  **Food Self-Sufficiency:** Swamps were drained to expand arable land from 391,000 hectares in 1950 to 713,000 in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. In 1976, Albania declared self-sufficiency in bread grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.

Nearing the end of his life, Hoxha, a long-time smoker and diabetic, suffered heart attacks in 1972 and 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. He chose Ramiz Alia as his successor in 1980, purging Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. Alia gained more power as Hoxha receded into a lonely semi-retirement, largely maintaining the economic isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. Hoxha died in April 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

## Stagnation and Fall

Initially, economic numbers seemed to support Hoxha's claims of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. In 1983, the CIA World Fact Book reported a $10 million export surplus, a slight state budget surplus, and no foreign debt, a rarity for Eastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. However, Albania fell into deep economic stagnation around that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. Throughout the 1980s, the economy grew at an average of 1.7%, zeroing out in the second half of the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. With a 2% annual population growth, the average Albanian became poorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

A five-year drought from 1983 to 1988 severely impacted agricultural output and hydropower generation, crucial for exports and chromite mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. Concurrently, a global oil glut crashed prices, hurting another major economic pillar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. Oil production fell far short of targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. Obsolete and broken Soviet and Chinese equipment could not be replaced due to [[albanias_economic_strategies_and_selfreliance | self-reliance]], leading to costly and inefficient attempts at rebuilding machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

The people suffered significantly: families were rationed 1kg of meat, 250g of butter, and 7 eggs weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. The average monthly wage in 1984 was $15, and citizens could not even keep their own livestock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. Even in the capital, water and electricity were only available for a few hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Observers noted the country's severe underdevelopment, with technology dating back to the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>.

Escape attempts were met with lethal force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. Jamming devices prevented foreign influence, and borders were heavily fortified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. In 45 years, about 1,200 people, mostly under 30, were killed trying to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.

After Hoxha's death, Alia sought gradual economic changes, slowly backing away from [[albanias_economic_strategies_and_selfreliance | self-reliance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. In 1986, he made quiet outreaches to the West, establishing diplomatic relations and relaxing travel restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. However, these reforms were insufficient as the Secret Police's grip weakened and Communist governments in Eastern Europe began to collapse by 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.

In July 1990, thousands occupied Western embassies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. Massive protests erupted in Tirana, leading to a breakdown of law and order and looting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>. Industrial output plummeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>. Alia's final reforms failed, and he called for free elections instead of using force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. The people tore down Hoxha's statues and demanded his name be erased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. In March 1992, the Democratic Party won power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

## Conclusion
Albania's pursuit of [[albanias_economic_strategies_and_selfreliance | self-reliance]] led to economic stagnation and decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>. Despite having natural resources and a strategic position, the country repeatedly turned away from leveraging these advantages, descending into an "anti-development" path and economic madness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. After 1992, Albania underwent one of the fastest transitions to capitalism, but a profound need for further economic reform persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.

The Hanfu movement is part of a broader trend of [[Han Supremacy in China | Han ethnic supremacy]] that has emerged as a point of concern on China's internet and in cultural discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This movement, along with other "Han culture" forums and websites, has become prevalent in China, Taiwan, and among the overseas Chinese diaspora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

## Revitalization of Han Culture

Proponents of the Hanfu movement advocate for the revitalization of specific aspects of Chinese Han culture, while simultaneously rejecting elements considered to have non-Han origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. A notable example is their rejection of Qing-era clothing, such as the Manchu *chi pao* or *makwa* (horse jacket), which netizens "cringed at" the idea of China encouraging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. Instead, they champion the *Hanfu*, clothing worn before what they term "alien rule" â€“ specifically, prior to the Manchu conquest of the Ming Dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

The Hanfu movement gained mainstream popularity partly because "the clothes look cute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. For many, it remained a harmless form of "nice cosplay" or a way for people in China and abroad to connect with their culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

## Gateway to Han Supremacism and Historical Revisionism

Despite its seemingly innocuous origins, the Hanfu movement and similar sites promoting Han culture have "served as a gateway drug for harder versions of [[Han Supremacy in China | Han supremacism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. [[Han Supremacy in China | Han ethnocentrists]], often connected to these movements, express a particular dislike for the Manchu people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

This leads to [[historical_revisionism_and_ethnocentrism | historical revisionism]], where they vigorously attempt to alter perceptions of the Qing and Yuan dynasties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. They portray the Qing Dynasty and its Manchu leaders as "very bloodthirsty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. Their narrative claims that the Manchu people "rolled back the Ming Dynasty's progressive advancements, stole the wealth of the Han people, butchered them and made China a backwards country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. They go as far as to equate the Manchu with colonists, similar to the British in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

This perspective simplifies complex historical events, such as the Qing conquest of the Ming Dynasty, which involved Han people fighting against other Han people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. Boiling it down to "bad Manchu victimizing innocent Han" is seen as "to hijack history for your own purposes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. The objective of such [[historical_revisionism_and_ethnocentrism | historical revisionism]] is to disavow 300 years of China's history and attribute its decline to a "foreign race," thereby absolving the Han of any blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The Hanfu movement underscores the ongoing racial issues within China, which pose challenges for the government, similar to how such issues affect governments with significant minority and majority populations globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. The existence of these sites across Chinese communities worldwide highlights a darker school of thought that posits an "inherent gap between the Han people and the barbarians," asserting that "other races are born barbarians" and that assimilation is a "fool's errand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.

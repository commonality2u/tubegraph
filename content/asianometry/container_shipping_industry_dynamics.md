The container shipping industry is a crucial component of global trade, often described as the backbone of globalization, responsible for carrying approximately 80% of the world's trade by volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:10">[03:07:10]</a>. Without it, international trade would be impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:46">[03:11:46]</a>.

## Industry Categories and Characteristics

Container shipping is one of three categories within the overall seaborn transportation industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:16">[03:16:16]</a>. The other two are bulk trade, which ships unpackaged goods like coal or grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:44">[03:23:44]</a>, and tanker trade, which carries liquids or gases such as oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:43">[03:29:43]</a>. While bulk and tanker transport are larger in total capacity volume, container shipping "punches above its weight class" in terms of value of goods shipped due to carrying more valuable items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:03">[03:34:03]</a>. These valuable shipments make the container industry quite competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:40">[03:41:40]</a>.

## Supply and Demand Dynamics

The shipping industry experiences significant "whiplash issues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:21">[06:01:21]</a> due to the volatile nature of demand and the inflexibility of supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:08">[06:08:08]</a>.

### Demand

Demand in the shipping industry has exploded over the years and is tied to macroeconomic factors such as the health of the world economy, seasonality, and "random new shocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:59">[06:09:59]</a>. Seasonality, like holiday shipping, is often short-term and can be prepared for, but random shocks (upwards or downwards) can significantly impact the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

### Supply

Supply, unlike demand, is not easily adjustable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:51">[06:33:51]</a>. While demand can spike or shrink by 20% year-over-year, shipping lines have limited options for rapidly growing or shrinking capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. Three major options for adjusting supply include:

1.  **Acquiring a competitor**: Larger shipping lines benefit from economies of scale, but integrating different lines is complex and can be ruinous if not managed carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
2.  **Commissioning new ships**: Building a new vessel takes years, making the timing and pricing of such an investment essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:44">[07:07:44]</a>. Companies risk investing millions for a boat that might launch at the wrong point in the business cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:32">[07:16:32]</a>. Conversely, scrapping a boat can reduce fleet size during low demand, but this is a drastic measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:25">[07:24:25]</a>.
3.  **Chartering**: This involves renting a ship from its owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:28">[07:35:28]</a>. The charterer handles cargo and voyage expenses (like fuel), while the owner manages operations and capital costs (like interest) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:17">[07:40:17]</a>. Charter contracts can range from a few weeks to up to 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:15">[07:49:15]</a>.

These options each present challenges, and companies must carefully balance market share and market risk when deciding to expand or shrink their fleet, as incorrect decisions can be disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

## Historical Context and Government Intervention

Historically, governments have played a role in shaping the shipping industry. In 1972, South Korea had only three container vessels, relying mostly on foreign liners for trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:36">[03:58:36]</a>. The Korean government decided to develop its indigenous container capacity, encouraging the first generation of containerized shipping lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:40">[04:06:40]</a>. By 1976, while the country had 36 ships and five international container services, 90% of Korean container exports and imports still used foreign carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:34">[04:17:34]</a>.

To address this, in 1976, the Korean government began explicitly subsidizing Korean container carriers with up to $1 million USD per year per carrier (in 1976 dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:07">[04:31:07]</a>. They also established the Korea Maritime and Port Administration to guide the industry's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

During the Korean export boom of the late 1980s and early 1990s, South Korean international trade volume tripled between 1987 and 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. Korean shipping companies positioned themselves as low-cost alternatives to Western lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. Throughout this period, the Korean government "carefully managed the industry like a bonsai tree" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>, dictating specific routes for companies and preventing new entrants into the domestic market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

## Impact of Financial Crises and Deregulation

The Korean export boom ended with the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. Korea, being one of the worst affected, received a financial bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. The IMF mandated policy changes in line with neoliberal governance beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>:

*   **Market Liberalization**: The Korean government was forced to liberalize its shipping business, opening the market to foreign players much faster than initially planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. Korean shippers were suddenly fully exposed to the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.
*   **Debt Reduction**: Korean business conglomerates were mandated to reduce their debt-to-equity ratios to below 200% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>, regardless of market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. This often forced companies to sell off ships to pay debt and charter new ones to maintain capacity, sometimes through sale-leaseback transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. While improving debt ratios, this significantly increased operating costs because banks and third parties charged higher short-term prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.

This combination of higher operating costs amid new foreign competition led to a long-term decline in Korea's indigenous shipping lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>.

### [[Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on Shipping | Global Financial Crisis of 2008]]

The [[Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on Shipping | Global Financial Crisis of 2008]] sparked a shipping overcapacity crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. Trade between the United States and Asia declined by 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>, leading to significant losses for market leaders, and debt soaring for many companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>. Working off an oversupply cycle like this takes years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.

## Case Study: [[History of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin Shipping]]

[[History of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin Shipping]], once Korea's biggest container shipping line and the fourth largest in the world by 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, illustrates many of these dynamics. It was established in 1977 as a branch of the Hanjin Group, one of South Korea's "chaebol" (large business groups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

After the [[Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on Shipping | global financial crisis]], [[History of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] sailed into troubled waters as freight rates crashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. Despite a temporary recovery in 2007-2008, [[History of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin]] decided to invest in a new round of mega-ships, unfortunately ordering at the exact wrong time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. By November 2008, they had committed to orders for nearly a quarter million TEU (20-foot equivalent units), a 40% increase in their fleet size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.

### Factors Contributing to Hanjin's Insolvency

[[Factors Leading to Hanjin Shippings Insolvency | Hanjin's ultimate downfall]] was driven by two main reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>:

1.  **Working Capital Crisis**: Despite owning profitable assets, poor chartering practices resulted in unprofitable ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>. After the founder's death and the splitting of the Hanjin empire among his sons, the company could no longer rely on a "rich sibling company" like Korean Air (which had provided an undeclared bailout in 1986) to provide extra cash during hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>. By 2014, Hanjin's debt had soared to 440 billion Korean Won (approximately $375 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. To cover this, Hanjin stripped itself of profitable assets, including domestic and overseas terminals, and its liquefied natural gas and bulk shipping divisions, leaving only the volatile container shipping line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.
2.  **Lack of Government Bailout**: In 2016, Korea Development Bank (KDB), Hanjin's largest creditor, demanded 700 billion Won ($615 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>. Hanjin could only offer 500 billion Won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>. While other countries like Denmark, Germany, France, and China had bailed out their shipping lines with billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>, the [[Korean Governments Decision on Shipping Bailouts | Korean government decided not to bail out Hanjin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. This decision had "echoes of the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. They also imposed strict restructuring conditions on Hyundai Merchant Marine (another troubled shipping line), which Hyundai met, but Hanjin could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>.

Hanjin's August 2016 insolvency caused global chaos in the shipping industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. Around 159 companies found their cargo stranded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>, with $4 billion worth of goods stuck at sea or in terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>. This included critical Korean exports, as Hanjin shipped 40% of Samsung's electronics and 20% of LG's products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>. Hanjin's collapse also led to the annihilation of tens of thousands of shipyard jobs in Korea and the Philippines, where they owned the Subic Bay Shipyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.

While Korea chose not to intervene, Taiwan, which relies on shipping firms to transport large quantities of goods for its economic development, bailed out its two container shipping lines, Evergreen and Yang Ming, in the fourth quarter of 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. Taiwan's Deputy Minister of Transportation, Wang Quai, stated that Hanjin's collapse demonstrated the need for government support to the industry "before the damage becomes uncontrollable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.

[[History of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] declared bankruptcy due to over 1.3 trillion Korean Won ($1 billion USD) in charter fees owed over the next 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>, with its last ship being sold for demolition in March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>.

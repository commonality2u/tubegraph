The year 2019 marked a significant shift in the semiconductor lithography industry, as [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] shipped its first high-volume Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) system, redirecting industry leadership from Asia to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This represented a substantial setback for Japan, which had previously dominated the lithography industry through companies like Nikon and Canon, but ultimately failed to commercialize EUV in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Japan's journey in EUV development, despite its eventual failure, illustrates the immense [[challenges_in_developing_commercial_euv_systems | challenges in developing commercial EUV systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## [[historical_context_and_industry_efforts_in_euv_advancement | Early EUV Research and Initial Preferences]]

EUV technology itself was pioneered in Japan in 1986, when Dr. Hiro Kinoshita of NTT successfully printed a circuit pattern using EUV light and a reflective optic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. However, at the time, EUV was merely one of several potential next-generation lithography candidates. The Japanese lithography industry, including companies like Nikon and Canon, explored various options such as Electron Beam direct write lithography, proximity X-ray, ion beam projection, Electron Beam projection, and 157 nanometer fluorine lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Japan's primary preference leaned towards proximity X-ray, which garnered the most early progress reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This assessment was shared by others; the U.S. Department of Energy's early EUV project concluded without industry follow-up, and as late as 1997, Sematech ranked EUV fourth, with X-ray in the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Japan's EUV Development Programs

The catalyst for Japan's dedicated EUV program was Intel's strong interest in the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. After observing demonstrations in Japan and at U.S. Department of Energy labs, Intel provided bridge funding to prevent the disbandment of the DOE EUV Project R&D team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. A year later, in 1998, Intel and other American semiconductor manufacturers founded EUV LLC, an industry consortium dedicated to commercializing EUV lithography with an estimated R&D budget of $60 million per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Caught off guard by Intel's move and due to U.S. restrictions on foreign participation, Japanese lithography makers Nikon and Canon were unable to directly join EUV LLC, although they could participate in design reviews and working groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This prompted Japan to pursue its own path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) Program

In 1998, a year after EUV LLC's founding, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI, now METI) launched its own EUV lithography program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This program was structured in three phases:

1.  **Phase 1 (1998-2001)**: Focused on developing basic technologies for EUV lithography and its three core system parts: the exposure tool, the mask, and the resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The government-funded research organization responsible for this phase was the ASET EUV laboratory (Association of Super Advanced Electronic Technologies), a multi-year consortium fully funded by MITI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
2.  **Phase 2 (2001-2003)**: Involved transforming ASET's raw technology into a working prototype, with partial financial support from the Japan semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
3.  **Phase 3 (2004-2006)**: Aimed at converting the prototype into a commercialized product by the Japanese semiconductor industry, presumably led by SALET and the lithography makers Nikon and Canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

#### Key Organizations

*   **ASET (Association of Super Advanced Electronic Technologies)**: A multi-year research consortium fully funded by METI, responsible for developing basic EUV technologies, particularly optics manufacturing, mirror multi-layers, and cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. ASET also initially handled the EUV photoresist, collaborating with the Himeji Institute of Technology for thin layer imaging (TLI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **EUVA (Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography System Development Association)**: Founded in 2001, EUVA took over the critical task of developing the [[engineering_challenges_of_the_euv_light_source | EUV light source]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. It included both academia (Himeji Institute of Technology, Kumamoto University, Miyazaki University, Osaka University) and industry (Ushio, Canon, Nikon, Komatsu, Gigaphoton, Toshiba, NEC, Fujitsu, Renesas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **SALET (Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies)**: A Japanese R&D research consortium with a $90 million annual budget, funded by industry, focusing on more applied technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Nikon's EUV-1 was installed at SALET's R&D Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Mirai**: A research consortium focusing on mask defect control detection subsystems, established by METI to handle the complex challenges of actinic light inspection for masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Leading Project**: Another consortium that managed inter-university collaboration related to light sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

By 2005, the Japanese EUV effort had expanded rapidly, with four research consortia (ASET, EUVA, Leading Project, Mirai) each focusing on a specific part of the EUV machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This decentralized structure was a notable difference compared to the American EUV project, which had a single entity, EUV LLC, overseeing early commercialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## Technical Challenges and Progress

The [[development_of_uv_and_euv_lithography_technology | development of EUV lithography technology]] required brand new substantial engineering work, despite sharing a philosophical heritage with its predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Exposure Tool

The exposure tool comprises an [[engineering_challenges_of_the_euv_light_source | EUV light source]] and an optic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. ASET initially focused on [[innovations_in_optical_systems_for_high_na_euv | optics manufacturing]] (adding reflective multi-layers to mirrors, cleaning them, and metrology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This meant the light source development was reassigned to EUVA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

EUVA investigated two main approaches for producing EUV light:
*   **Laser-Produced Plasma (LPP)**: Firing a laser at a material to turn it into plasma, which emits EUV light. This was the approach eventually chosen by [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Discharge-Produced Plasma (DPP)**: Creating a cloud of material and then firing high-powered sparks between two electrodes to create light-emitting plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

Both approaches were researched by EUVA, with LPP at the Hiro Scott Research Center and DPP at the Gotemba Research Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Nikon's EUV-1 initially used a DPP contraption from Ushio and its subsidiary Extreme Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. While DPP was considered more power-efficient, physically smaller, and cleaner, it struggled to output sufficient power for high-volume production, leading to slower throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. The EUV-1's light source power topped out at 100 Watts, far short of the eventual goal of 250 Watts for high-volume production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. This required a system change from Xenon to Tin as the target material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Although the Tin-based DPP concept was intricate, it faced contamination issues and struggled with power output, and the project ended before these issues were overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] also experimented with DPP but halted work in 2013, achieving sufficient power levels only after pioneering its laser double-shot method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

### Resist

The main challenge with EUV photoresists stemmed from EUV light's high absorbability, limiting its penetration to about 700 angstroms, significantly less than the 4,000 angstroms traditional resist materials could handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This necessitated the development of new technologies for "thin layer imaging" (TLI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Masks

Developing defect-free EUV masks was immensely difficult due to the incredible tolerances required. ASET's ambitious intermediate goal was 0.1 to 1 defects per square centimeter, with an eventual target of 0.003 defects per square centimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. A defect could be a deviation of just a few nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Traditional DUV light could not penetrate deep enough to detect such defects, requiring the use of EUV light itself for inspection, known as "actinic light" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Mirai, a separate organization, was established to address this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. By 2005, Mirai successfully produced an actinic blank inspection tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Nikon and Canon's EUV Efforts

Japan's lithography leaders, Canon and Nikon, were tasked with producing the actual EUV exposure tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Their strategy involved first developing a small field prototype (pre-alpha machine) for testing components like the resist and mask, followed by a full field prototype (alpha machine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. The U.S. had delivered their small field "Micro Exposure Tool" (MET) in mid-2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Japan's aggressive schedule aimed for a pre-alpha machine by late 2005, an alpha tool by 2006, and a beta tool by 2007, to catch up with [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

### Canon's Journey

Canon, the junior partner in EUV development, completed its small field prototype, the SFET, in 2006 in collaboration with EUVA. It generated EUV light using a Krypton Fluorine laser fired at xenon gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. The company had plans for a full field prototype, the VS2, to be completed by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. However, Canon struggled with core EUV problems such as raising power levels, producing defect-free masks, and extending optic system lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. The global financial crisis further impacted Canon's profitability, leading to cuts in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Ultimately, Canon never built the VS2 and ceased its [[development_of_uv_and_euv_lithography_technology | lithography technology development]] at this stage, continuing to sell only KrF non-immersion systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

### Nikon's Efforts

Nikon, as Japan's lithography leader and a producer of immersion lithography, was ahead of Canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. From 2001 to 2004, Nikon worked with ASET to produce three iterations of its small field prototype EUV tool, nicknamed HINA ([[high_numerical_aperture_euv_machines | High Numerical Aperture tool]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

In April 2006, Nikon began producing its first full field exposure tool, the EUV-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This alpha device was completed and installed at SALET's R&D Center, going live in January 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This was approximately 1.5 years behind [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML's]] Alpha Demo Tool, delivered in August 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. While a substantial achievement, the EUV-1 was not yet commercially competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Its late installation pushed the high-volume EUV ship schedule from the 45 nanometer node to the 32 nanometer node, necessitating a more powerful light source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

The EUV-1 used a Discharge-Produced Plasma (DPP) light source from Ushio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Despite its innovative design, this [[euv_light_source_development_and_laserproduced_plasma | EUV light source]] struggled to output sufficient power, topping out at 100 Watts against a target of 250 Watts for high-volume production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. It also faced persistent contamination issues from carbon and a mysterious silicon carbon compound called cyloxane, which deteriorated mirror reflectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

After successful testing of the EUV-1, Nikon planned for the EUV-2, aiming for completion in 2011-2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. However, it became clear that [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] had established a significant lead of 18 months to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. The global financial crisis led Nikon to cut R&D budgets in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. Although Nikon denied putting EUV development on hold, the EUV-2 became an in-house unit, with plans for an EUV-3 by 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. By 2011, Nikon was targeting the 16 to 11 nanometer process nodes for around 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

A pivotal moment occurred in July 2012 when Intel, Nikon's second-biggest customer, announced an investment of up to $4 billion into [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] in exchange for a stake of up to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. This signaled Intel's commitment to [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] as its primary EUV partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. Without Intel as a cornerstone customer and facing R&D expenses of hundreds of millions of dollars annually, Nikon likely decided it was no longer economically viable to continue developing EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. Nikon's EUV efforts quietly ceased, with the EUV-3 never reaching its planned 2012 ship date, leaving [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] as the sole dominant player in the EUV lithography industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

## Outcomes and Legacy

Japan's EUV efforts, while not culminating in a commercial high-volume EUV machine, were not entirely in vain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. Many component efforts translated into viable, technologically advanced businesses. For example, the actinic blank inspection tool from Mirai, in collaboration with Lasertec, became a successful product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. Japanese companies like JSR, Shin-Etsu, and Tokyo Ohka Kogyo also hold dominant positions in the EUV photoresist space, while Tokyo Electron manufactures the equipment to apply these photoresists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

The total cost of Japan's EUV development from 1999 to 2012 is estimated to be between $5 to $10 billion, an exponential jump from the $150 million cost of the VLSI project that established Japan's semiconductor dominance in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

In conclusion, Japan's failure to produce a high-volume EUV machine was primarily due to economics and competition, rather than insurmountable technological barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. The race was close, but [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML's]] lead, combined with the financial pressures of the global crisis and Intel's strategic investment, ultimately forced Nikon and Canon to withdraw from the main EUV lithography machine market.

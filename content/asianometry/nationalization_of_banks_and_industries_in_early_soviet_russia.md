In its early period, the Soviet Union sought to establish a society without money, a policy which ultimately proved disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Despite the country being severely impacted by years of [[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_soviet_economy | war and revolution]], the Bolsheviks aimed to immediately create their ideal socialist utopia: a [[soviet_unions_attempt_to_abolish_money | moneyless society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This endeavor strangely coincided with the printing of hundreds of billions of rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Theoretical Underpinnings: Marx's View on Money
Classical economists viewed money as a neutral medium facilitating trade, but Marx acknowledged this while emphasizing its role in societal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
Marx believed money contributed to cyclical booms of over and under-production within capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Capitalists, focused on profit, would hoard money if M Prime (resale price) was not greater than M (purchase price), leading to periodic overproduction crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
Additionally, Marx saw money as the mechanism through which the bourgeoisie exploited the working class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Workers' wages were less valuable than their work's output, generating wealth for capitalists, causing workers to become alienated from their production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. In a centrally planned socialist society, money would not be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The Bolsheviks, therefore, widely adopted the notion of eliminating money from the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Economic State of Russia (1914-1917)
[[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_Soviet_economy | World War I]] prompted governments across Europe, including Russia, to abandon the gold standard and print money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The Imperial government left the gold standard in June 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The war led to:
*   Large government budget overruns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   Foreign borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   Physical destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   Collapses in economic output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   High rates of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Between 1913 and 1917, the number of industrial workers in Russia fell by 16.4%, and total industrial output declined by 22.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. By early 1917, paper rubles in circulation surged to 9 billion, a 5.5-fold increase from July 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The Russian government's deficit in 1917 was 82% of its budget, with 73% of that deficit funded by printing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Upon seizing power, the Bolsheviks inherited an economy in an inflationary crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918 resulted in Russia losing a third of its population, nearly a third of its agricultural land, and over half its industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The [[impact_of_bolshevik_policies_on_oil_companies | oil wells of Baku and the Caucasus]], accounting for 97% of Russia's total oil output, were inaccessible until late 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Ukraine, a vital region, had supplied 78% of Russia's coal, 74% of its iron ore, and 80% of its grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The [[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_Soviet_economy | Russian Civil War]] further complicated matters, with Bolsheviks not reliably controlling Ukraine until 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Bolshevik Policies: From Theory to Practice
Lenin outlined the construction of the new Russian socialist economy in "The Immediate Tasks of Soviet Rule," aiming for a dictatorship of the proletariat and centralized economic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Nationalization of Banks
Marx believed banking was central to capitalism, and "The Communist Manifesto" listed establishing a single central bank as the first step toward centralizing the means of production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Russia's financial system was already centralized, with 12 banks holding 80% of the country's capital, making nationalization relatively swift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

On November 20, 1917, the People's Commissar of Finance seized the Russian State Bank (Goss Bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Private banks were ordered to fund worker-controlled factories, but their refusal led the Bolsheviks to occupy the largest banks in December 1917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Their capital was transferred to Goss Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. By the end of 1918, all banks were liquidated and merged into Goss Bank, which no longer lent money but merely accounted for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This nationalization choked credit flow, leading to the closure of 405 enterprises and 205,000 workers in the first quarter of 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Nationalization of Industry
In June 1918, the Council of People's Commissars announced the nationalization of industry, seen as cutting the "wires" through which capitalists controlled the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Throughout late 1918 and early 1919, the Soviet government nationalized railways, shipping, mining, and other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Lenin aimed for firm control over critical economic levers, but the process was chaotic, with less than 14% of nationalizations handled by the central government; the majority were carried out by local organizations and trade unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This chaotic approach led to the expulsion of many skilled workers and business owners, whose replacements often lacked the expertise to operate the enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## War Communism and its Economic Consequences
During the [[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_Soviet_economy | Russian Civil War]] (summer 1918 to end of 1919), the Bolshevik government prioritized supplying the Red Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Industrial policies focused on using every available laborer and resource for the war effort, including forced mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
The war and nationalization strained the treasury. With no foreign loans due to the repudiation of debts and nationalized assets, the government relied heavily on money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Income taxes in 1918 covered only 7.3% of spending, forcing the Bolsheviks to raise indirect taxes and implement an extraordinary income tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### Hyperinflation and Demonetization Efforts
By the end of 1918, inflation reached 598%, with over 60 billion rubles in circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The value of rubles, in 1913 terms, had plummeted from 2.4 billion in 1917 to 222 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Food supply was a critical issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. The Tsarist government's grain monopoly, continued by the Bolsheviks, forced farmers to sell surpluses to the state at fixed prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. The crashing ruble made wages worthless to peasants, who refused to sell at official prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. The government responded by "requisitioning" food, further discouraging production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. In May 1918, a "food dictatorship" was announced, allowing armed force to seize food from peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

Hyperinflation intensified, with the People's Bank printing as much money as possible from May 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Inflation doubled to 1,376% in 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Budgeting became impossible, with money printing costs consuming 45-60% of the mint's budget in late 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

Remarkably, the Bolsheviks interpreted this hyperinflation as a sign of successful socialist transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. They believed unlimited paper money printing would devalue it to nothing, annihilating the power of the wealthy and leading to state distribution and a [[soviet_unions_attempt_to_abolish_money | moneyless world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. "The ABC of Communism" stated that the extensive issue of paper money would promote the gradual disappearance of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. However, it also highlighted the Bolsheviks' continued reliance on the failing capitalist system to sustain their industrial and war efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

After the Red Army largely won the Civil War by April 1920, the Bolsheviks intensified their policies, believing they could win the "economic war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. They aimed to take over the entire supply and distribution system, making public services free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. In December 1920, Lenin signed decrees making medicines, food, consumer goods, fuel, and postage free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Private trade was to be abolished, and taxes and wages were to be paid in kind (physical goods), reaching 93% of wages by 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
Attempts to replace money included accounting units based on physical properties, salt, cooperative funds, or "tred" (a day of simple labor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. These units only caused confusion, leaving the hyper-inflating ruble as the only practical medium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. In 1921, 16.3 trillion new rubles were issued, yet the government still ran a deficit of 21.9 trillion rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. In 1922, issuance swelled to 1.97 quadrillion new rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

## The Collapse of War Communism
By 1921, the Soviet government recognized that "War Communism" had gone too far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. The economy was in ruins; the state was unprepared to centralize control over every item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Illegal markets flourished, supplying most people's food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Production of steel, sugar, and bricks virtually ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Overall industrial production fell to a third of pre-war (1913) levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

Without money, incentives to work disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Railway worker desertion rates hit 40%, and a worker in 1920 produced only 45% of their pre-war output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. Hyperinflation devastated living standards; daily caloric intake in 1919 fell by 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. A famine in 1921-1922 caused 5 million deaths, exacerbated by food requisitioning that left peasants with no reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Peasant revolts, notably the Kronstadt rebellion in 1921, compelled Lenin to re-evaluate the direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## Reversal: The New Economic Policy (NEP)
In March 1921, Lenin implemented the New Economic Policy (NEP) to reverse the economic decline, boost output, and stabilize the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. By 1923, after issuing 176.5 quintillion new rubles, the Soviet government fully reversed course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. They issued a gold-backed currency, made the Central Bank independent, and rebalanced the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. This led to a calming of rebellions and economic recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

Lenin acknowledged their error, stating they were "caught up in the wave of enthusiasm" and mistakenly believed they could directly apply political and military enthusiasm to economic tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. He attributed mistakes to [[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_Soviet_economy | Civil War]] interruptions, but the state's initial intention during War Communism was to forcibly transition away from capitalism, create a trade monopoly, and eliminate money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. These plans, however, resulted in chaos, violence, and a complete collapse in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

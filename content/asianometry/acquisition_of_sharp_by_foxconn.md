Japan's [[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp Corporation]], a company with a century-long history of iconic products such as mechanical pencils, calculators, and TVs, faced significant financial challenges starting at the turn of the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The company became increasingly focused on a single, highly competitive business, facing attacks from foreign competitors and running low on funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This difficult situation ultimately led to its acquisition by a Taiwanese electronics giant, marking the first foreign takeover of a major Japanese consumer electronics company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Sharp's Decline and Vulnerability

Despite its initial success and dominance in various markets, particularly in [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCD and electronics industry]] due to its pioneering work in liquid crystal displays (LCDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, Sharp's financial health deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. The company's pivot towards LCD displays in the late 1990s, ditching its venerable CRT television business, was a risky move given the intense competition emerging from Taiwan and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

Large investments in new TFT LCD factories, such as the Kamiyama plant (completed in 2004 and 2006 at a cost of $4 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>, strained company finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. These investments coincided with massive facilities built by competitors like Taiwan's AU Optronics, Sony, Samsung, and LG, leading to an oversupply in the LCD panel industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. As a result, the cost of a 32-inch TV panel plummeted from $865 in 2004 to $149 by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

Sharp's TV market share fell from a high of 80% to under 10% by the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>, and the LCD television market became a "cheap commodity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. Further investments, such as the $3.4 billion Sakai factories announced in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>, exacerbated the situation. Sony, initially planning a 33% ownership in the Sakai factories, ultimately did not go through with the full purchase due to Sharp's internal management issues between its TV and display panel divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

The global financial crisis in 2008 led to a collapse in sales and increased losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. By March 2009, Sharp reported its first net loss since going public in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. The company continued to struggle, reporting a net loss of over $5 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2012, nearly leading to bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. Key leaders and former leaders, including Katayama, Machida, and Okuda, eventually exited their positions after a staggering $5 billion loss announcement in March 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

## Foxconn's Strategic Interest

In 2012, Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics giant, initiated its interest in Sharp by purchasing a 9.9% stake for approximately $854 million, along with a larger share in Sakai Display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Foxconn's business model is characterized by a "land and expand" strategy, aiming to take over a client's entire manufacturing supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. In the low-margin electronics assembly business, Foxconn generates profits through economies of scale and vertical integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. The display component is often the most expensive part of electronic gadgets like mobile phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.

Foxconn had previously helped consolidate Taiwanese display companies to create one of the world's largest TFT LCD panel makers in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. Acquiring Sharp's capacity and technologies would significantly enhance this "roll-up strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

## The Acquisition Process

Initially, Foxconn sought a more substantial partnership or even an acquisition, but Sharp declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. Despite continued losses for several years, Foxconn maintained its interest.

By 2016, after three more difficult years, Sharp finally accepted Foxconn's offer to purchase a controlling 66% stake for $6.2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. However, Foxconn revised this offer down to $3.8 billion upon discovering additional financial liabilities within Sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. Despite other proposals, including some organized by the Japanese government, Sharp's bank creditors ultimately sided with Foxconn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

## Significance and Aftermath

Sharp's acquisition by Foxconn represented the first foreign takeover of a leading Japanese electronics firm, marking a "sad end for a venerable 100-year company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.

Following the acquisition, Foxconn appointed Taiwanese executive Tai Jung-woo as Sharp's new CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. Tai implemented cost-cutting measures, including closing unprofitable overseas ventures, reducing employee numbers, and moving production out of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. In its first full year under Taiwanese management, Sharp returned a small profit for the first time in four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

Tai reoriented the company back towards producing branded electronics products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>, and Foxconn also began rebuilding Sharp's semiconductor manufacturing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>. In February 2022, Tai retired, and a new Foxconn CEO, who previously led the company's brand products division, took over, further indicating Sharp's future direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

Sharp's history demonstrates that its success stemmed from using technology to produce the "right products at the right time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. However, its later over-reliance on LCDs and misplaced confidence in its technological superiority in a "brutal grinding business with low margins and high insecurity" ultimately contributed to its downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. The future direction of the Sharp brand under Foxconn's ownership remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.

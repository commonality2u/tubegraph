The semiconductor industry, despite its strategic importance, faces significant challenges in attracting and retaining talent, particularly in manufacturing roles. Online discussions, such as those on Hacker News, often portray semiconductor careers negatively, describing them as having "long hours, subpar labor practices, and low pay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Types of Semiconductor Jobs

Broadly, the semiconductor industry has two main job categories:
*   **Design Jobs**: These roles involve creating the designs that foundries then fabricate into physical chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Companies like TSMC also hire IC design engineers to work with customers on chip preparation for fabrication, and software developers (including AI engineers) to develop algorithms for machine performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. These jobs are generally more akin to software engineering, offering comfortable office environments or remote work, and high salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Jobs**: These positions involve direct work in the fabs, often requiring clean suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The goal of semiconductor manufacturing is to deliver extremely complicated products at staggering scale, demanding "military-style execution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Realities of Manufacturing Careers

In Taiwan, manufacturing line workers are typically divided into two types:

### Line Technicians and Operators
*   **Responsibilities**: Debugging manufacturing issues, operating the line, and inspecting products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Work Schedule**: Often work 12-hour shifts (7 am to 7 pm or vice versa) on a "two days on, two days off" schedule. This is legal in Taiwan and the U.S., though some U.S. states require overtime pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Education**: Requires a high school or vocational school degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Career Progression**: Limited, usually topping out at foreman status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Compensation**: Pay is significantly better than low-wage jobs like those at a convenience store, but comes with high anxiety and pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Engineers
TSMC employs several major categories of engineers who co-work with technicians to guide processes and fix problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>:
*   **Process Engineers**: Inspect and analyze manufacturing processes, optimize variables, and test for optimizations when yield rates are low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This is considered a very difficult job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Equipment Engineers**: Monitor and inspect equipment, responsible when it breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. They require a technical degree, not always electrical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. In Taiwan, they may even buy charms in temples hoping to make devices more obedient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **R&D Engineers**: Work on new product development, racing against time and competition to create new processes and products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. These jobs face high pressures, regularly require PhDs, and involve 10+ hour days on experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Success in these roles brings recognition and significant company impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Production Management Engineers**: Focus on production forecasting and logistics, ensuring proper dispatch, resource availability, and customer awareness of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Strong English skills are often required due to interaction with Western customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Smart Manufacturing Engineers and AI Engineers**: Use big data and AI techniques to improve production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Foundries globally have struggled to fill these positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Talent Acquisition Challenges

### Competition with Software Development
In the United States, the semiconductor industry struggles to fill positions due to the allure of the software development industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Software development is often considered the "single best job category in the world" due to:
*   Relative ease of entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   Abundance of companies needing developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Legendary perks and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   Obscenely high salaries, especially with stock compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

For instance, 9 out of 10 Berkeley EECS majors graduating in 2018 went into software engineering, often viewing electrical engineering as merely a prerequisite for jobs at companies like Google or Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Those who remain in semiconductors often pursue chip design, which shares similarities with software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Most highly educated individuals prefer working remotely and writing code over wearing a clean suit and entering a factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Global Challenges
This problem is not unique to the U.S.:
*   **China**: China's own growing microelectronics industry faces struggles to hire and retain experienced line technicians, as young, bright workers in Shanghai prefer becoming software developers for major tech giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This contributes to the [[Challenges and advancements in Chinese semiconductor industry]].
*   **Taiwan**: Even in Taiwan, where TSMC is revered (likened to how American parents view Google or Apple), the company experiences substantial turnover among its technician and engineer ranks due to a very demanding work culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. American employees training with TSMC in Arizona have also reported culture clashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The growing presence of chip design companies like MediaTek, Delta Electronics (offering comparable salaries), and non-Taiwanese companies like Google (whose main hardware R&D hub outside the U.S. is in Taiwan and has poached Mediatek talent) makes it easier for semiconductor manufacturing talent to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

To counter these issues, TSMC announced an unusually high 20% employee wage raise in 2020 (effective 2022) and has worked to make it easier for employees to purchase company stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. While more pay doesn't solve work environment issues, it helps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This is part of the broader [[Industry strategies for attracting talent to semiconductor manufacturing]].

## Industry Strategies and Their Limits

Intel has found success in building its own pipelines for semiconductor specialists:
*   **United States**: Partnership with Arizona community colleges to enroll prospective technicians in two-year technical education degree programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Malaysia**: Offered research grants for students to learn semiconductor engineering, particularly in packaging, and contributed senior engineers' time to train them in industry practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

The benefit of these "ground zero" approaches is a trained, affordable workforce tailored to the company's specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. However, a downside is that these workers develop highly specialized skills, making it difficult for them to leave the field, potentially leading to underpayment or poor treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This reflects the fact that only a few companies perform advanced semiconductor manufacturing, limiting the employer pool compared to software engineers or IC chip designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. The question remains how to address the "strategically important but economically undervalued" situation of semiconductor skills, with suggestions including individual income credits for hardware technicians or extra taxes for software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Immigration as a Solution?

The recently passed CHIPS Act is expected to create approximately 27,000 new jobs from about eight new fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. A report from Georgetown suggests the industry will likely need at least 3,500 highly skilled foreign workers with prior expertise from firms like TSMC or Samsung to bring tacit engineering knowledge to American workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

However, the political feasibility of a special immigration program for these roles is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. High-level executives and R&D personnel, many of whom were educated in the U.S. or hold dual citizenship, already have avenues to come to the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. For semiconductor engineers and technicians, 3,500 jobs might not be considered a serious enough shortage to warrant a unique program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. For comparison, the H-1A visa program created in the 1980s to address a nursing shortage issued nearly 40,000 visas over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Furthermore, immigration doesn't address the fundamental issue of Americans choosing software careers over hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

## Lack of Hardware Interaction

A core reason for young Americans' disinterest in hardware careers is their lack of easy access to hardware for tinkering, unlike software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Software Accessibility**: It's easy for young people to download open-source software and set up a website, sparking interest for a future career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Hardware Complexity and Barriers**:
    *   **Right to Repair laws** contribute to this difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
    *   **Increasing complexity**: In the 1960s, an average person could understand and fix a transistor radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Personal computers were more complex but still allowed direct interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Today's cell phones are too complex, built with technology stacks that a single person could spend a lifetime studying, often limiting user interaction to just changing the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

As a result, users interact daily with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and slick user experiences (UX) software rather than physical hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This leads to interest in software careers. Modern devices are perceived more as "mystical remote talismans" than manipulable tools, and young people never get to see or tinker with the integrated chips inside, leading them to pursue other fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

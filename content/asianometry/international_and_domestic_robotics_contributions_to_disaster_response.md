Robotics have played a crucial role in responding to and decommissioning nuclear disaster sites, minimizing human exposure to hazardous radiation. The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent tsunami led to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant meltdown, prompting significant advancements and deployment of robots for various tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Early Robotics in Nuclear Disasters

### Three Mile Island (USA)
The first nuclear response robots were developed by the United States following the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Surveillance and In-service Inspection Robot (SIIS):** First deployed in August 1982, three years after the accident. It was a crawler designed to take photographs, collect samples, and make radiation readings in high-radiation areas inaccessible to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Fred:** Introduced the year after SIIS, Fred was equipped with a high-pressure water spray for decontamination work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Remote Reconnaissance Vehicles:** Three of these were built and deployed to de-fuel the Three Mile Island reactor core, which was flooded with radioactive water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

These early robots were practical, tethered, built with familiar technologies, and kept small, successfully flushing, scraping, and cleaning walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Chernobyl (Soviet Union)
After the Chernobyl disaster, the Soviet Union initially relied on hundreds of thousands of human "liquidators" or "biorobots" to clean up rubble and debris due to extremely high radiation levels that caused available robots to fail, and bureaucratic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Eventually, robots were brought in, notably the Specialized Transport Robot (STR-1), a wirelessly controlled bulldozer adapted from an unmanned lunar vehicle, used for removing debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Fukushima Daiichi Disaster Response

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant consisted of six units. Units 1-3 suffered the worst damage, experiencing meltdowns and hydrogen explosions that released radioactive materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The plant's owner, TEPCO, and the Japanese government have committed billions to its safe decommissioning, primarily utilizing advanced, [[development_and_deployment_of_fukushima_robots | radiation-hardened robots]] to minimize human risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Initial Phase: International Aid
The first robot arrived at Fukushima in April 2011, three weeks after the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Pakbot:** Four military multipurpose robots from the American company iRobot Corporation were brought in to enter the damaged Unit 1, 2, and 3 reactor buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Pakbot, previously used in Iraq and Afghanistan for detecting explosives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, measured radiation dosage, atmospheric temperatures, and oxygen concentrations inside Unit 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Warrior:** A larger robot from iRobot, nicknamed Warrior, was used for additional cleaning work, vacuuming and clearing obstacles in the second half of 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **T-Hawk:** A small unmanned aerial vehicle from Honeywell, the T-Hawk flew over Units 1-4 from April to July 2011 to review the situation and collect dust samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

Despite their success, Pakbot had limitations, including radio communication range issues and difficulty navigating stairs due to its treads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Domestic Contributions: Japan's Response

The reliance on American robots sparked a mild controversy in Japan, a nation known for its robotics technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Japan's Rescue Robots (JAEA):** After a 1999 criticality accident, three Japanese technology centers, including what is now the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), developed a line of nuclear disaster robots, such as the Remote Surveillance Squad or "Rescue Robots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, due to a lack of budget, these robots received little to no upgrades after their 2001 completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. When the Fukushima disaster occurred 10 years later, they were not ready; many critical components were out of stock, and there were no trained operators, as the original engineer had left the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. JAEA re-engineered a Rescue robot into the JAEA-3, grafting parts from the Swedish-built Brock robot (which was on site), and it began missions in September 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

*   **Kinsei Series (Chiba Institute of Technology):** TEPCO turned to the Kinsei series of search and rescue robots, developed by the Neito Project at the Chiba Institute of Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Kinsei robots featured continuous tracks and were designed to be waterproof and highly mobile across difficult terrain like underground malls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. TEPCO requested modifications, primarily [[impact_of_radiation_on_robotics_technology | hardening the robots against radioactivity]] for a new mission: installing a water gauge and taking samples in the reactor building basement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Radiation Hardening Techniques

[[impact_of_radiation_on_robotics_technology | Radiation hardening]] is critical for robots operating in nuclear disaster zones. Nuclear accidents release various forms of radiation, including alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, x-rays, and neutron particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Displacement Effect:** Particles like neutrons and alpha particles can collide with semiconductors, displacing atoms and shifting structural arrangements. This alters device properties, leading to higher current leakage or decreased lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Ionization Effect:** Electrons, protons, and x-rays passing through semiconductors create electron-hole pairs, causing permanent glitches and erratic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

Damage can occur at device, circuit, and system levels, necessitating hardening at all three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Device Level:** Modifying transistor layouts, adding insulating substrates (e.g., silicon on insulator fab approach), or increasing device size (larger gate sizes for higher current capacities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Circuit Level:** Duplicating critical circuits or adding monitoring circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. These protections are generally hardware-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **System Level:** Implementing radiation armor, redundancies, and preventive scrubbing algorithms via software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Kinsei's conventional electronics were tested for gamma ray resistance; its essential components (180nm CPU, motherboard, motor driver boards) could survive about 200 Grays (20,000 rads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Initial measurements at Fukushima were around 100 Grays, suggesting Kinsei could operate for over 100 hours with only a 10% chance of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. The new Kinsei entered reactor buildings in June 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. However, a communication link failure forced the abandonment of the first Kinsei robot in October 2011. Kinsei 2 and 3 were redesigned and deployed in February 2012 to address this flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

## Decommissioning Phase: Ongoing Robotics

The Japanese government's long-term goals involve gradually decommissioning the plant and rebuilding the surrounding area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This multi-step process is overseen by TEPCO and the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning (IRID) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Cleanup Robots
*   **Astaco Sora (Hitachi):** A heavy-duty robot developed to remove rubble scattered across the site by hydrogen explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Raccoon and Arounder:** Smaller cleaner bots that spray down the ground around reactor Unit 2 or other areas with high-pressure water jets or dry ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Meister:** A heavy-duty robot capable of drilling for samples or vacuuming particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

### Spent Fuel Removal
The next step is removing spent fuel assemblies from each unit's storage pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Unit 4:** In December 2014, TEPCO successfully removed 1,535 spent fuel rods from the damaged Unit 4 reactor pool, relocating them to a cooling pool in Unit 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Unit 3:** TEPCO began removing 566 spent fuel rods from Unit 3 in 2019, completing the task in February 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Units 1 & 2:** Removal for these units is scheduled to start in 2023 or beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### Melted Fuel Debris (Corium) Inspection and Removal
In Units 1-3, the nuclear fuel melted down, burning through the reactor pressure vessel and concrete pedestal before resolidifying into "corium" within the primary containment vessel (PCV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This debris must be inspected and removed. IRID used different robots for each reactor due to their unique circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

*   **Unit 1:** The PCV is flooded to a depth of 2 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
    *   In 2012, TEPCO and the team punched a small hole into the PCV for wired cameras and water tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
    *   In 2014, IRID developed a "P-morph" robot designed to squeeze through a 100mm hole, then twist into a U-shape to travel around a lead plate for radiation shielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The first P-morph encountered an obstacle and had to be left, but improvements led to mission completion. The next step is building a robot to collect the pebble-like nuclear fuel debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

*   **Unit 2:** This unit suffered a meltdown but no hydrogen explosion, leaving the building structure more intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
    *   TEPCO produced a "Scorpion" robot, similar to P-morph, which could crawl through a small hole and reconfigure itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Deployed in 2017, its left tread failed, and it was left inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
    *   The team eventually photographed the entire inside of the reactor with a camera on a fishing rod, stitching multiple shots into a panorama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

*   **Unit 3:** The PCV is almost entirely flooded to a depth of about 6 meters, requiring new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. The best entry point was only 14 centimeters wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
    *   It took two years to build a suitable robot. The "Mini Manbo" (little sunfish), only 13cm wide and 30cm long, successfully recorded video of the nuclear debris in 2017, making headlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

With the nuclear fuel debris located, IRID and TEPCO plan to begin collecting and removing it from Unit 2 first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This will involve a massive stainless steel robotic arm, sitting outside the PCV, reaching in through a hole to pick up debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. The project start is delayed into 2023 to improve the arm's capabilities and add attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

IRID expects it will take at least 10 years to remove all nuclear fuel debris from the Fukushima site, with more cleaning and decontamination work needed for years beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Despite the progress, indicated by the government lifting evacuation orders for towns closest to the plant, only a small percentage of residents have returned, highlighting the ongoing need for both human and robotic efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

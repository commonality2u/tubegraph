On October 16, 1964, the People's Republic of China (PRC) detonated its first domestically produced atomic bomb, joining the United States, Soviet Union, and Great Britain as one of the five Atomic Powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This achievement took China less than five years to produce a working nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While the program eventually became [[chinas_indigenous_nuclear_weapon_development | China's indigenous nuclear weapon development]], early Soviet assistance played a significant role.

## Initial Chinese Motivations and Soviet Reluctance
When America held a monopoly on the atomic bomb, Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party leadership feared potential American nuclear intervention in the Chinese Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. During his visit to Stalin in December 1949 to negotiate China's entry into the Soviet Bloc, Mao sought the assurance of a nuclear umbrella over his country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

The Soviets, who had only recently broken the Western nuclear monopoly, were initially reluctant to grant such protection, even implicitly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The original text of the [[sinosoviet_relations_and_treaty_of_friendship | Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance]] stated that in the event of an invasion, the other signatory country would "render assistance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Zhou Enlai suggested adding "with all means at its disposal" to strengthen the clause, which was eventually accepted despite initial Soviet resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. However, nothing about nuclear weapons was formally written down, leaving the interpretation open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Korean War and "Nuclear Blackmail"
The meaning of these clauses was tested during the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. As American forces approached the Yalu River, the border between North Korea and China, the Chinese worried about an invasion of communist China and the potential use of American nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Chinese leadership decided to intervene, betting that the Americans would not risk all-out nuclear warfare with the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Mao's gamble paid off, and the Americans did not use nuclear weapons, though they threatened to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

After the Korean War, American threats regarding nuclear weapons had a strong impact on Chinese leadership, who termed it "nuclear blackmail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Comments from U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> and General Curtis LeMay, commander of the Strategic Air Command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, further alarmed China. During the first Taiwan Strait crisis (late 1954-1955), U.S. military leadership recommended using nuclear weapons, though President Eisenhower refrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The U.S. also signed a mutual defense treaty with the Republic of China in December 1954, which the Communists believed would embolden the Kuomintang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. These crises gave China's ambition to produce an atomic weapon a special urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## Limited Assistance Under Stalin
China had long been aware of the [[role_of_espionage_in_soviet_and_american_nuclear_programs | Soviet nuclear program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. A few weeks before the first Soviet detonation in 1949, a Chinese Communist Party delegation led by Liu Shaoqi asked Stalin to tour nuclear installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Stalin, perhaps surprised, instead showed them a nuclear testing documentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. While alive, Stalin never transferred any atomic technology, only offering the aforementioned "protection" of their nuclear umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Khrushchev's Shift in Policy
After Stalin's death in 1953 and Nikita Khrushchev's rise to power, Soviet policy towards China's nuclear ambitions changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Khrushchev sought Chinese support to boost his domestic influence and further de-Stalinization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In September 1954, he emphasized the importance of helping China develop its industry to solidify their friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

During a meeting in October 1954, Mao asked Khrushchev to assist China in its nuclear weapons program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Khrushchev was initially surprised and tried to dissuade China, urging them to focus on economic development and reiterating the offer of a nuclear umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. However, the Chinese insisted, and the Soviets eventually agreed to cooperate on certain items for peaceful atomic energy use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Early Soviet Assistance (1955-1957)
In April 1955, the PRC and Soviet Union signed the Sino-Soviet Atomic Cooperation Treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Under this agreement, the Soviets provided:
*   A 6,500 to 10,000 kilowatt experimental nuclear power plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
*   A 12.5 to 25 Mega electron volt cyclotron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>
*   A team of nuclear experts, led by the head of the Soviet Institute of Nuclear Physics, who showed atomic energy movies and lectured to 1,400 Chinese scientists and Zhou Enlai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>
*   Scientists to explore China's uranium reserves in Xinjiang, with useful uranium prioritizing Chinese domestic use before export to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>

In February 1956, Khrushchev expanded this cooperation, agreeing to send more Chinese students to the Soviet Union and help build nuclear research facilities in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Despite the high point in [[sinosoviet_relations_and_treaty_of_friendship | Sino-Soviet relations]], Mao and his colleagues viewed it as an "alliance of convenience" that would eventually end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Chinese Internal Efforts and Expatriate Scientists
The PRC rapidly increased its science research funding, from $15 million in 1955 to $100 million in 1956, with much of it going to the Chinese Academy of Sciences for purchasing Western scientific literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

The Chinese nuclear program also heavily relied on repatriated Chinese-born scientists educated or who worked in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Notable examples include:
*   **Dr. Qian Xuesen (Chen Sha Sen)**: Co-founded the Jet Propulsion Lab, controversially lost his job in the U.S. due to communist sympathies, and his persecution was a boon for the PRC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Chen Wei Tung, Chen San Chang, and Peng Huanwu**: Peng, a quantum physicist, earned two doctorates in 10 years and was the first Chinese student of Nobel laureate Max Born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Chen San Chang studied uranium fission and gamma rays at The Curie Institute in Paris and became director of The Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences upon his return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

Despite their patriotism, these scientists were unfairly attacked by far-left elements within the Communist Party of China as "rightist intellectuals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Zhou Enlai intervened in 1956 to end the persecution, and the scientists found peace only after being relocated to remote areas away from cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## The Turning Point: 1957 Agreement
By 1957, Soviet transfers were helpful for accelerating reactor design for peaceful atomic energy, though the Chinese already knew how to produce accelerators and reactors from published Western literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. However, a nuclear weapon required specialized techniques and extensive infrastructure, and the Soviets resisted sharing direct design or production knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

A shift occurred in late October 1956, following anti-communist protests in Hungary and Poland, which the Soviets violently repressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Weakened, the Soviets needed the backing of their primary foreign ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. In 1957, against military advice and that of Ivan Kurchatov (father of the Soviet Atomic program), Khrushchev decided to transfer atomic bomb technology to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

In October 1957, the Chinese and Soviets signed the "Agreement on Production of New Weapons and Military Technology Equipment and Establishment of a Comprehensive Atomic Energy Industry in China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This agreement promised:
*   A "teaching model atomic bomb" complete with designs and documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>
*   Technology for casings, processing uranium and plutonium, and testing guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>

## Controversy and Effectiveness of Transfers
The actual helpfulness of the Soviet Union's transfers for China's nuclear weapons program remains a subject of debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Khrushchev claimed the Soviets transferred their deepest secrets and kept no secrets from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. However, Soviet scientists were reportedly told to limit what they shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

The Chinese were generally unimpressed with the nuclear weapons design information they received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. A Soviet lecture on July 15, 1958, covered nuclear weapon theory, structure, and assembly, but:
*   No documents were given, only a basic sketch on a blackboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   The audience was mostly administrative personnel, not scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   No parameters or formulas were provided, and notes were not allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   The Chinese also claimed the 1958 lecture contained "completely wrong data" that misled their scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

Dr. Chen San Chang, familiar with nuclear weapon concepts from his time in the United States, noted that what the Soviets told them was similar to information from "capitalist countries, but with a few more details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The subsequent [[sinosoviet_relations_and_treaty_of_friendship | Sino-Soviet split]] complicated objective assessment, as both sides were incentivized to exaggerate or downplay their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Broader Technological Transfers
Despite the debate over direct nuclear weapon design transfers, the overall scale of technology transferred from the Soviets was massive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **Uranium Mining**: The two countries collaborated closely on prospecting and mining efforts, with Soviets helping with aerial surveys and prospecting labs in China's substantial uranium mines in Xinjiang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. (Though China later claimed Soviet advice to prospect sedimentary soils was unhelpful, as their best deposits were in granite and igneous rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.)
*   **Missile Technology**: The Soviets provided some of their best missiles, including the R-12 intercontinental ballistic missile, which the Chinese received for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   **Fissile Material Production**:
    *   **Uranium-235**: The Soviets deeply influenced the production of uranium-235, particularly through gaseous diffusion technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. China's gaseous diffusion plant in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, was spotted by U.S. aerial reconnaissance as early as August 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
    *   **Plutonium-239**: China built an integrated plutonium fuel facility, utilizing an early Soviet design for its reactor and chemical separation plant in the Jiuquan prefecture, Gansu Province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

This period of deep military technology cooperation lasted from 1957 to 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

## The Sino-Soviet Split and Aid Withdrawal
The [[sinosoviet_relations_and_treaty_of_friendship | Sino-Soviet split]] was complex, with issues arising as early as 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Khrushchev's secret speech criticizing Stalin's Cult of Personality infuriated Mao, who saw it as an indirect attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

Mao's comments at the November 1957 Moscow Conference of World Communists and Workers' Parties also dismayed the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Mao stated that if half of mankind died in a nuclear war, the other half would remain, imperialism would be destroyed, and the world would become socialist, eventually repopulating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. These "flipping comments" caused Khrushchev and Soviet leadership to grow dismayed, leading them to renege on the promised "teaching bomb prototype" in early 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. The Soviets postponed the bomb transfer indefinitely, citing concerns about straining relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

The second Taiwan Strait crisis in 1958, where Mao shelled the Kinmen and Matsu islands, further threatened nuclear war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. Khrushchev realized he had made a "horrible mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>, believing Mao was consciously trying to provoke a third world war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. In June 1959, he sent a letter terminating military cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Most Soviet military advisers left within a month, with the last departing in July 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

In the end, 40% of the promised equipment and raw materials never arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Only a minority of the 30 [[sinosoviet_relations_and_treaty_of_friendship | Sino-Soviet nuclear industry projects]] were completed, and nine had to be shut down entirely, forcing China to often start over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

## Impact of Withdrawal and Chinese Response
The withdrawal of Soviet advisers was a significant blow, though not entirely unexpected, as PLA leaders suspected the Soviets aimed to maintain a technical gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. In January 1960, the Chinese launched the "596 project" (named after the "shameful date" of Soviet aid withdrawal), signaling their determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Zhou Enlai declared they would achieve a breakthrough in three years, master technical know-how in five, and have a stockpile in eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

Embroiled in economic and social pressures from the Great Leap Forward, China abandoned its dual-track approach, postponing the plutonium bomb method to focus solely on the uranium-235 design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. When the last Soviet advisors left the Lanzhou gaseous diffusion facility in July 1960, Chinese technicians had to manage the complex task of sourcing tens of thousands of materials and supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Despite political interference, such as technicians disassembling Soviet-provided equipment for "technological innovation," and severe food shortages during the Great Leap Forward, progress continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

By the end of 1961, the Lanzhou plant's machinery was successfully installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The Chinese found substitutes for many Soviet components, including a special lubricant for gaseous diffusion pumps that the Soviets had kept secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. By mid-1963, Lanzhou scientists were successfully isolating uranium-235, achieving 90% enrichment by January 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

## Indigenous Bomb Design and US Underestimation
With enriched uranium, China focused on designing and assembling the bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. They chose an implosion design (like the Nagasaki bomb) but used uranium-235 instead of plutonium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. The key challenge was synchronizing high explosives to initiate the chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. By the time the Soviets left in 1960, the Chinese had completed theoretical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>, aided by some "sloppy shredding" of critical papers by the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Working with hand calculators, they mastered implosion theory by late 1962 and had a final design by a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. In late 1963, uranium arrived at the manufacturing plant in Zoucheng, Gansu, where it was machined into a highly enriched uranium sphere and packaged as the "596 bomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

The successful [[chinas_first_atomic_bomb_detonation | Chinese nuclear test]] caught both Americans and Soviets off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. The U.S. government knew about China's program by 1959 and considered intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. President Kennedy discussed military intervention with Khrushchev in the early 1960s, but Khrushchev never embraced the idea, and Kennedy's administration members pushed against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. U.S. spymasters were confused by China's choice of an implosion bomb using uranium, misjudging the size and capability of the Lanzhou gaseous diffusion plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Ultimately, the Americans underestimated the Chinese nuclear effort until the eve of the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[chinas_indigenous_nuclear_weapon_development | China's indigenous nuclear bomb program]] was a massive undertaking, involving hundreds of thousands of people across various institutions and costing an estimated $4.1 billion (1957 prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. These costs came during the economically difficult years of the Great Leap Forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

The extent to which the program benefited from Soviet technology transfer remains debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. Deng Xiaoping told the Romanian Ambassador in 1966 that if the Soviets hadn't broken the treaty, China wouldn't have built the bombs so fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. While the Soviets gave considerable aid, much work remained after their withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>. However, the "sting and shame" of the abrogated treaty provided the Chinese with the determination to finish the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

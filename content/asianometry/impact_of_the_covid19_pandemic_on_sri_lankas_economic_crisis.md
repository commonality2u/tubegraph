Sri Lanka's economy faced a significant shock with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which severely impacted the country's primary economic drivers, particularly those generating foreign exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

## Decline in Key Foreign Exchange Earners

The pandemic led to a sharp decline across several vital sectors:

*   **Exports** Garment, tea, and rubber exports experienced a rapid decline due to lockdowns in major markets like India, Europe, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. The Sri Lankan Export Development Board had projected $18.5 billion in export earnings for 2020, but actual total exports amounted to only $11 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   **Foreign Remittances** Remittances from migrant workers drastically declined, as pandemic lockdowns in countries such as [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | South Korea]] and Qatar meant workers were unable to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Reductions in international travel also hindered workers' ability to travel abroad, exerting further downward pressure on remittances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. Remittances were a critical crutch, representing 6-8% of the country's economy and its second biggest earner of foreign income after exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. In 2019, migrant worker remittances of $6.7 billion covered over 85% of the country's foreign exchange shortfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.
*   **Tourism** The tourism industry, which had seen double-digit growth with the boom in Chinese tourism after the civil war ended, and had become the country's third largest foreign exchange earner after exports and remittances, was severely impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. The pandemic, following a series of suicide bombings in 2019, caused tourism to plummet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. In 2018, Sri Lanka welcomed 2.5 million tourists, generating $5.6 billion in foreign exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. By 2020, only half a million tourists visited, and earnings declined by 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

## Government Response and Consequences

With its second and third largest foreign currency generators crippled, the government turned to [[sri_lankas_import_substitution_policies_and_their_impact | import substitution]] for items like fertilizer, aiming to preserve dwindling foreign reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. However, this policy led to domestic shortages, power cuts, rationing, and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. The Sri Lankan Rupee experienced a substantial drop in value against the US dollar from March 2022, exacerbated by extensive money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. This loss of value in savings without access to foreign currency threatened to push people back into poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

The pandemic contributed the "final push" to an [[effects_of_debt_and_infrastructure_projects_on_sri_lankas_economy | economic hardship]] that had been brewing for a long time, indicating the country was already on the brink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. The shift in Sri Lanka's economy from manufacturing to debt-funded infrastructure, with support for remittances, had reduced its resilience against external shocks like the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

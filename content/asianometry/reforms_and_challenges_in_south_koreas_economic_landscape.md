South Korea's economic strength, built on massive business groups like Samsung, Hyundai, and LG, is also its significant economic weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These groups, while powering the export economy and dominating daily life, also manipulate the Korean economy for their benefit and maintain corrupt ties with high levels of power through millions in payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Historical Context of Economic Influence

Corruption in Korea predates the modern state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The Japanese colonial state's agricultural economy was marked by corruption and inequality, with large landlords exploiting farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Many of these legacies passed to the new South Korean government after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, which fell under the Western sphere of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This historical context contributed to [[the_impact_of_historical_legacies_on_south_koreas_economy | the economic structure]].

### The Genesis of Chaebol

South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee, a staunch anti-communist, created the [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. To raise funds for the Korean War, his government sold off assets seized from the old Japanese state and other prized state-owned entities between 1946 and the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. These privatizations were determined by private negotiation rather than public auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, allowing valuable companies like Tong Yang Beers (now Oriental Breweries), De Haan Textile, and Tong Yang Cement (part of the Tongyang Group) to be acquired cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The purchasers of these assets became the [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, similar to Japan's zaibatsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Crony Capitalism Under Park Chung-hee

In 1961, Park Chung-hee led a military coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Initially, he arrested [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] heads for corrupt wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. However, his government quickly negotiated a crony capitalism deal with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Park sought to emulate Japan's industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, and the [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] agreed to support his policies for import substitution and later exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. In return, the government provided foreign currency loans at below-market interest rates to acquire foreign technologies and build capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] also contributed funds, in the form of 10-15% loan commissions (kickbacks), to Park's presidential election campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This system incentivized companies to maintain close ties with the president to access cheap capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Kickbacks grew significantly, with the top five [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] contributing over 800 million won annually before 1972, rising to 1.5 billion won after 1972 (adjusted to 1990 prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

For 20 years, the government and [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] ran Korean society as dominant actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Companies funded political campaigns and satisfied the social compact of economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The government granted privileges and shifted the costs of [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] excesses onto society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. For example, in 1971, when [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] were over-leveraged, the government converted their private market loans to five-year public ones and froze private interest rates, effectively harming small lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Economic Imbalances and Growing Discontent

By the mid-1980s, the balance of power decisively shifted in the [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]]'s favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The top five [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] accounted for nearly 20% of the country's GDP and 45% of its mining/manufacturing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The top ten [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] owned an average of 8.6 manufacturing businesses (20-40 businesses total) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

This [[Social Inequality and the Role of Big Business in South Korea | chaebol-centric strategy]] suffocated South Korea's small and medium-sized business sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. From 1966 to 1976, manufacturing firms grew only 10% in number but exploded 176% in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. In contrast, Taiwan, with a less cozy state-business relationship and no devastating war, saw its manufacturing firms grow 150% in number and 29% in size during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

The vast imbalance between the [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] and the rest of the country became a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. As people grew richer, they demanded more than just higher wages; they wanted better environmental regulations, working conditions, and a better life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The government, increasingly democratic, shifted from a stance of support to one of regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. However, leaders still relied on [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] financial contributions to stay in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. During Chun Doo-hwan's administration, [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] contributed 15-22 billion won to political campaigns, and 21-25 billion won during President Roh Tae-woo's administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

This corrupt deal persisted partly due to the weakness of South Korea's political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. During military rule, parties were mere shells for candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Even after democratization in 1987, the lack of suitable campaigning norms and above-board financing systems left parties starved for cash, making them vulnerable to [[political_and_financial_environment_in_south_korea | corruption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This allowed [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] to continue receiving government aid, plentiful capital, favorable regulations, and protection from competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Asian Financial Crisis and Subsequent Reforms

The Asian Financial Crisis demonstrated the consequences of South Korea's inability to rein in its big businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. In the decade following democratization in 1987, [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] gained substantial political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. For instance, Daewoo Group forced the National Assembly to amend a law to bail out its ailing shipbuilding corporation in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. They also pushed for rapid liberalization reforms to aid their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

One such reform allowed [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] easier access to foreign capital financing, leading to a massive debt boom that culminated in the Asian Financial Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Another reform permitted [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] limited ownership stakes in non-bank financial companies, encouraging complex cross-ownership structures that obscured their true size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. For example, the Lee family, controlling Samsung Group, exercised operating control over most affiliated firms with only a minority of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. These complex structures meant it was unclear which subsidiaries were profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, leading profitable companies to prop up weak ones, creating market inefficiencies and oversupply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

The crisis in 1997 significantly curtailed the power of the [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]], opening the door for [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun administrations imposed various [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | reforms]] on the ailing [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] to prevent another financial crisis by limiting debt capacity and cross-shareholder structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### Consequences of Reforms

While some [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | reforms]] succeeded, they had wide-ranging consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. For instance, Hanjin Shipping had to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio below 200%, forcing it to sell ships and lease others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | Reforms]] also cut "fat" in industries; the Korean car industry, which had five independent companies in 1997, soon had only one: Hyundai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | Chaebol]] reduced their affiliates from 819 in 1997 to 544 three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, and dividends to minority shareholders increased significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

The crisis also spurred the creation of the Korean export juggernaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Facing an unfriendly domestic environment, the largest [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] seized on free trade agreements in the 2000s and expanded globally, achieving wild success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. By 2013, 86% of Samsung's revenue came from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This success drove South Korea's economic recovery, with an average GDP growth rate of 5% from 1998 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## The Cost of Growth: Social Inequality

Despite impressive GDP growth, the benefits were concentrated among a small group, leading to a significant gap between the "haves" and "have-nots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. In 2013, [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] brought in over 50% of revenue and value-add in manufacturing but employed less than 20% of the sector's employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

As part of post-1997 [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | reforms]], the government allowed [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] to more easily lay off workers to increase profitability and service debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This resulted in hundreds of thousands losing their jobs, many of whom never found regular salaried work again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Elder poverty in South Korea since reached four times the OECD average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The income share for the top 1% of Korean society rose from 7% before 1997 to 12% in the mid-2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This growing [[Social Inequality and the Role of Big Business in South Korea | inequality]] led the Korean people to vote for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## Political Responses and Persistent Challenges

### Lee Myung-bak Administration

In 2007, President Lee Myung-bak, a conservative and former CEO of Hyundai Construction, won the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. His campaign emphasized economic recovery after what he called a "lost decade" of liberal rule, despite the economy growing at 5% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. His "747 promise" aimed to raise GDP growth to 7%, achieve $40,000 per capita income, and make South Korea the seventh-largest economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

Lee's policies indicated a belief that prior years had held back [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]]'s ability to compete globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. He lowered the corporate tax rate, raised the ceiling on non-bank financial investment, and amnestied executives convicted after the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. He also oversaw market-oriented [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | reforms]] giving more decision-making power to industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Unlike Park Chung-hee, Lee did not force [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] to invest profits into new, risky industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, instead funneling money to older industries like construction and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. Ultimately, his administration failed to deliver the promised growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. In 2018, Lee was arrested on charges of bribery, embezzlement, and tax fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### Park Geun-hye Administration

In the 2012 presidential election, conservative Park Geun-hye emphasized nostalgia for "glory years" combined with welfare, but did not advocate for a higher capital gains tax, a key factor in the accelerating [[Social Inequality and the Role of Big Business in South Korea | wealth gap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Her administration later ended in a series of [[political_and_financial_environment_in_south_korea | corruption]] scandals and impeachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

### Modern Corruption and its Broader Impact

Modern [[political_and_financial_environment_in_south_korea | corruption]] by the [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] aims to maximize their wealth and market power through tax manipulations and regulatory capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. These actions have severe consequences, as tragically demonstrated by the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking, which claimed 304 lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. The high death rate was largely due to safety and rescue regulations being ignored by the regulatory agency and the ferry company, which worked closely together to maintain a profitable status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This included the rotation of government employees into the industry and the ferry company's monopoly privilege on a lucrative route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

### Ongoing Challenges

President Moon Jae-in, Park Geun-hye's successor, responded with certain business [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | reforms]] and higher tax rates, leading to some improvement in public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. However, South Korea's economy is highly dependent on its powerful global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Substantial [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | reform]] is likely to weaken their global competitive position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. The issue of [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | chaebol]] [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | reform]] and what to do about it remains a furiously debated and polarizing topic in South Korean presidential politics, alongside concerns about North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

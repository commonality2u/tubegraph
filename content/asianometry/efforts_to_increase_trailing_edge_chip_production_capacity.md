The global chip shortage has significantly impacted the availability of [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges|trailing edge semiconductors]], which are crucial for a vast array of industrial and consumer applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Microcontrollers, such as the ATSAMD21, often manufactured on these nodes, have experienced significant stock outs, with some systems being unavailable until 2023 or beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Challenge of Trailing Edge Nodes

[[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges|Trailing edge process nodes]] generally refer to technologies 16 nanometers or older, according to TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. These can be further subdivided into "mature" (40-450 nanometer range) and "legacy" (older than 450 nanometers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Most microcontrollers are produced using 110-nanometer or 180-nanometer processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Many of the approximately 200 fabs currently operating globally are older, built before 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. While initially producing leading-edge chips with high margins, these fabs eventually see prices collapse as products commoditize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. However, they remain economically viable as long as market prices exceed variable costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Prior to the pandemic, [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges|fab capacity]] at these nodes was already tight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The initial economic slowdown in early 2020 led to production halts and order cancellations, including a 50% cut by STMicroelectronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. However, an unexpected rebound later that summer, coupled with unprecedented demand from cloud computing, 5G transition, and armed conflict, led to depleted inventories and widespread shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Fab utilization rates have soared to the mid-90s, indicating foundries are operating at their limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Microchip executive Steve Sanghi estimates an additional $150 billion in investment is needed over the next five years to meet [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges|trailing edge demand growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Despite hundreds of billions committed to new fabs globally, only 6% of this expenditure is dedicated to mature or legacy node capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Companies have been hesitant to invest due to customer expectations of low prices set by fully depreciated fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Wafers for these nodes are cheap, accounting for only 10% of total sales revenue despite contributing significant microprocessor volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Building new fabs could lead to substantial underutilization and financial underperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Furthermore, many of these foundries rely on older, niche equipment, with over 200 fabs using 200-millimeter wafers, for which new equipment is not readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### The 28-22 Nanometer Generation Gap

The 28-22 nanometer node range is significant because 28 nanometers is arguably the most advanced node still using a planar gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Newer nodes require more complex FinFET gates, rampant multi-patterning, and potentially extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. These complexities lead to less reliable products, lower yields, and higher costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

Consequently, 28 nanometers represents the bottom of the cost curve on a per-100 million gate basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Many customers, particularly automotive companies that consume 40% of [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges|trailing edge chips]], prioritize reliability and effectiveness over speed, making older nodes more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Industry Efforts and Solutions

With backlogs for older nodes extending 18 months or longer, the industry is taking action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Building New Fabs and Investment

*   **TSMC** is constructing two new [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges|trailing edge fabs]] in Japan and Kaohsiung, operating in the 28-22 nanometer range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. They have also announced price increases on older nodes to help fund these investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Samsung** has committed to investing more in [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges|trailing edge semiconductor capacity]], marking a significant shift from their usual focus on leading-edge technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry|China]] is actively building up to a dozen new fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. SMIC, a leading Chinese foundry, is investing over $9 billion to add [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges|trailing edge wafer capacity]] in Shanghai and Shenzhen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   [[challenges_in_indias_semiconductor_manufacturing|India]] is also making moves, with Vedanta and Foxconn signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to build a [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges|trailing edge fab]] (65-28 nanometer range) with substantial [[government_subsidies_and_investments_in_semiconductor_manufacturing|government support]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   The **U.S. CHIPS Act** has appropriated $2 billion specifically for "mature technology nodes" to incentivize construction and modernization in the American semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Optimizing Existing Fabs and Design

Beyond new construction, the industry can improve the operating performance of existing [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges|fabs]]:

*   **Wafer Size Upgrades**: Moving from 200-millimeter to 300-millimeter wafers can yield over twice as many dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. While this requires substantial changes to floor layout and automation, it doubles output without building a new fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **Design Side Improvements**: Introducing new tools and open-source EDA software can make hardware development cheaper and facilitate die shrinks or design adaptation to different nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. An example is the open-source 130-nanometer PDK released by Google and SkyWater Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Outlook

While efforts are underway, significant supply constraints for [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges|trailing edge chips]] are expected to continue until at least 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. However, positive signs include a slowing growth in revenues for these nodes, the ongoing construction of new fabs by major players and countries like [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry|China]] and [[challenges_in_indias_semiconductor_manufacturing|India]], and a potential macroeconomic slowdown that could dampen overall demand, possibly coinciding with the new supply capacity hitting the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

From 1960 to 1973, the Soviet Union launched 15 probes and orbiters to Mars, locked in [[competition_between_soviet_union_and_united_states_in_space_exploration | competition with the United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While the Soviets "won Venus" with their [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera missions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, they struggled to match NASA's successful Martian program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. They lost the race to fly by Mars, orbit Mars, and safely land on and photograph the Martian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Early Ambitions and Sputnik's Influence

The foundation of the Soviet space program began in 1950 when Stalin sought a missile capable of hitting Western enemies, turning to Sergey Korolev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Korolev, a Ukrainian, initially worked with gliders before moving into rockets, which placed him in a unique position to reverse-engineer German V2 rocket designs in the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. He eventually delivered the R7 missile, successfully fired in 1957 after Stalin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Stalin's passing also eased the political climate, allowing Korolev to pursue his dream of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Early in the R7's development, he told his engineers that the rocket's purpose was to "get there," pointing to the Moon, Venus, and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

In January 1956, after significant lobbying, the Politburo approved the development of "Object D," an artificial satellite later known as Sputnik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. After three failed launches, Sputnik 1 was successfully put into orbit on October 4, 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This unexpected success caught the West by surprise, leading to headlines akin to those seen after Pearl Harbor and prompting American elites to try and catch up in the [[historical_space_race_between_us_and_ussr | space race]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Capitalizing on Sputnik's triumph, Korolev's team proposed a lunar expedition in January 1958, expanding this to a vast new program by July 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This program envisioned sending robot spacecraft to Mars and Venus using an upgraded three-stage R7 rocket, followed by a four-stage R7 to send humans to these planets and eventually establish colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

While the Soviet space program focused heavily on lunar probes in 1958-1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, Mars was considered the "real prize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The goal was to exploit an orbital window that occurs roughly every 25 months for Mars, originally planned for 1958 but slipped to 1960 when the Soviets learned the Americans also delayed their Venus probe, Mariner 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Interplanetary travel to Mars was estimated to take seven months and required speeds of 11 kilometers per second, necessitating additional rocket stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## The 1M Project (1960)

In January 1960, Khrushchev expressed concern about the growing American space program and urged Korolev to launch to Mars and Venus within the 1960 window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. A month later, Korolev drafted Project 1M for Mars, targeting a September 1960 launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

The two 1M spacecraft, each weighing about 640 kilograms, were to be launched by a new, more powerful four-stage R7 rocket, the 8K78 or Molniya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. However, in February 1960, this Molniya rocket only existed on paper, and Korolev's team had to build its fourth stage from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The rush to meet the autumn launch date resulted in chaotic production, with factories producing faulty components and probes arriving in pieces, requiring extensive repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Issues persisted, including a faulty radio system on the lander that failed ground tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Some planned instruments, like the ultraviolet spectrograph and television system, were removed due to integration issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

A team member's dark humor proved prescient: "The first time we won't fly any farther than Siberia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The rushed effort to build the rocket and probe was too much too fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

*   **October 10, 1960:** The first 1M rocket, making its inaugural real flight, suffered heavy vibrations during its second stage burn and broke up over Eastern Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **October 14, 1960:** The second probe's third stage failed to trigger due to a frozen kerosene leak, causing it to break up in the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Both 1M launches failed before even attempting to fire their newly built fourth stages, setting a concerning precedent for future flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Khrushchev had reportedly brought models of the Mars craft to the United Nations as a gift for President Eisenhower, but they were never given due to the failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Nadelyan Catastrophe and 2MV Project (1961-1962)

A few weeks after the 1M failures, tragedy struck with the Nedelin catastrophe, a horrific accident involving an R-16 missile prototype launch. A short circuit caused the second stage engines to fire prematurely, detonating the first stage tanks and incinerating technicians, including program head M.I. Nedelin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. His body was never found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

Despite this, Korolev's team launched two Venus probes (1Vs) in February 1961, similar to the 1M probes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. One successfully entered Venus's orbit and was named Venera 1, becoming humanity's first true interplanetary spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

Korolev then plunged into the 2MV project, which included landers and flyby probes for Venus and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. [[technological_advancements_and_failures_in_soviet_mars_missions | Soviet scientists]] struggled to make the Molniya rocket reliable due to manufacturing issues in its lower stages and the critical fourth stage's difficulty in igniting in zero gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Between February 1961 and September 1962, seven straight Venus probes failed, including two American ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

The Soviet space program built six 2MV probes, three for the 1962 Mars launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. These large probes (900 kg, 3.3 meters long) carried significant cameras and instruments for detecting life, though some were removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

The first 2MV series probe, 2MV-4 No. 1 (Sputnik 22), launched on October 24, 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Boris Chertok, Korolev's Deputy, recalled being told to remove the Mars vehicle from the launch pad at Baikonur (which only had two pads) to replace it with an ICBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Despite the national emergency and armed soldiers, the Mars probe launch eventually proceeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Sputnik 22, however, failed in Earth's orbit due to issues with the fourth stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Launching during such a geopolitical situation was "kind of nuts," as a Wyoming warning station initially mistook the rocket's debris for a swarm of nuclear missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## Mars 1 and Zond Series (1962-1964)

When 2MV No. 4 (Sputnik 23) launched on November 1, 1962, it was named Mars 1 after initial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The probe separated and unfurled its solar panels, but a gas engine in the orientation system began leaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Ground control managed to stabilize it for a while, but contact was lost on March 21, 1963, a few months before its arrival at Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. The silent probe might have photographed Mars but had no way to send data back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Nevertheless, it earned the name Mars 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

Troubled by 2MV series failures, the Soviets introduced the Zond series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Two Zond probes were sent to Venus; only Zond 1 made it to space but suffered equipment failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. In November 1964, Zond 2, intended for Mars, also suffered fatal onboard failures, including a failed solar panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## Mariner 4's Impact and Program Reorganization (1965-1966)

The stinging failures of the Zond series were worsened by news that the Americans had reached Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Mariner 4, launched around the same time as Zond 2, flew by Mars in July 1965, sending back 22 photographs covering about one percent of the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Mariner 4 revealed Mars as a cold, dead world, much like the Moon, with no canals, no magnetic field, and a very thin atmosphere, dampening enthusiasm for future Mars missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

At this point, the Soviets realized the Americans were serious about a moon landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. In August 1964, the Politburo directed Korolev to enter direct [[competition_between_soviet_union_and_united_states_in_space_exploration | competition with the U.S.]] for a moon landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This race to the Moon threw the Soviet space program's plans into managerial chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

With his focus shifting to the Moon, Korolev no longer had the bandwidth for robot planetary missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. In March 1965, the Mars program was reassigned to a new firm, Lavochkin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Korolev famously told the team, "I hand over to you the most valuable possession, my dream. I expect you to work hard, but if my faith is not rewarded, I'll do has Taras Bulba once said: 'I gave you life, and I will take your life'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, referencing a novel where the main character kills his son for betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

Korolev passed away less than a year later, in January 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. His death, possibly due to a botched operation or untreated tumor, was profoundly felt in the Soviet space program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

Mariner 4 had changed everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The new Lavochkin team concluded that the first generation of Mars craft had fundamental flaws and that the previous agency (OKB-1) was spread too thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. The Soviet Mars team aimed to surpass Mariner 4 by soft-landing a probe and searching for microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. In October 1965, Soviet leadership rebooted the entire program, meaning they would miss the next Mars launch window in October 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

## M69 Project (1969)

With the Americans pushing forward with more Mars missions, the Soviets aimed to launch something by 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. The new project, M69, abandoned the old 3MV Zond designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. This was partly for a fresh start and because Mariner 4 showed the Martian atmosphere was too thin for previous Lander designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

The Soviet Mars program received a boost from the new UR-500, or Proton, rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Originally an ICBM, the Proton could send 4-5 metric tons on an interplanetary trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. The M69 plan envisioned a Mars Orbiter and Lander for atmospheric study, soft landings, and microorganism searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

Initially, they tried adapting a lunar design (Year 8), bolting the lander to the probe side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. However, this design had fundamental propulsion system issues, including challenges with balancing and fuel leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. In February 1968, Georgi Babakin, the engineering head, made the risky decision to scrap the design and redo it, just 13 months before the launch date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

The new, cleaner design centered on a single spherical tank for fuel, with an engine, antenna, solar panels, and instrumentation attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Mar 69 carried three color cameras and was the first Soviet planetary device with an onboard computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. An entry probe and lander were initially planned but removed due to weight and testing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. The new design weighed over 5 tons, mostly fuel, exacerbated by a lack of advanced semiconductor technology to shrink instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

The mission plan involved an extremely complicated launch sequence: a three-stage Proton rocket to Earth orbit, separation, a fourth stage firing, and then the M69 probe firing its own engine multiple times for trajectory adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. Such a sequence had never been attempted before and carried great risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

The Lavochkin team worked under immense stress due to [[impact_of_political_pressure_on_soviet_space_missions | political pressure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. The Communist Party issued a special military-industrial resolution to ensure the 1969 launch date was met, with weekly updates demanded by the Central Committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. Underperforming suppliers were blacklisted, and divisions worked around the clock, with specialists picked up from their homes and free meals provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. Workers received no overtime pay, expected to work out of "enthusiasm for the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

> [!warning] Failed Launches
> Tragically, all this effort was in vain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>:
> *   **M69A (March 27, 1969):** Exploded 438 seconds into launch due to a rotor failure and pump issue in the Proton rocket's third stage, scattering wreckage over the Altai mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.
> *   **M69B (April 2, 1969):** Failed at launch when the right engine on its first stage failed, causing the rocket to tilt, fall back, and explode, spewing toxic materials over the launch pad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

These failures highlighted the Proton rocket's "high rate of rapid unscheduled disassemblies" until a major overhaul the following year improved its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. The intense political pressure was ultimately detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. This defeat was compounded when the Americans triumphantly landed on the Moon with Apollo 11 in July 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>, followed by Mariner 6 and 7 missions to Mars a week later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

## M71 Project (1971)

Disappointed, the Soviet program turned to the next Mars launch window in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. M69's failure meant engineers lacked atmospheric data needed for a soft landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. 1971 was a "special year" due to a close approach between Earth and Mars, ideal for launching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

Managers faced a dilemma: redo M69 to get atmospheric data (delaying landers until 1973), or launch landers now without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. They decided to send three probes:
*   **M71S (Orbiter):** Launched early to get atmospheric data, carrying extra fuel instead of a lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.
*   **Two M71P (Landers):** Would arrive later and use the data to calculate correct entry trajectories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

Soft landing in the thin Martian atmosphere onto unknown ground was the hardest part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. The Americans, designing their Viking landers, opted for a controlled gliding entry, enabled by their detailed atmospheric knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. The Soviets, lacking this data (and with Americans not sharing it), had to use an "uncontrolled ballistic entry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

> [!info] Uncontrolled Ballistic Entry
> This method meant the entry probes' trajectories were entirely determined by gravity, atmospheric drag, and entry conditions (initial velocity, angle, probe properties) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
> The plan was to release the entry probe 46,000 kilometers above Mars, fire engines to assume a 120-degree entry angle, and deploy the parachute as high as possible (around 35 km) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. This parachute deployment, at Mach 3.5 (over 2,600 mph), had never been done before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. Tests involved dropping probe models from high altitudes, accelerating them with gunpowder engines to Mach 3.5 for parachute deployment tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.
>
> The sequence relied on timers, with a radio altimeter and soft landing engine controlling descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. After landing, rockets would carry the parachute and entry probe bits away from the site to prevent obstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. Gunpowder engines for M71 were produced at a dangerous institute, where walls were engineered to fall down during explosions to protect the main structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.
>
> To ensure lander survival, five models were built and launched by catapult onto simulated Martian ground at 30 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. Once settled, the landers would open, take scientific measurements, snap pictures, and potentially deploy a small "Prop-M marsokhodnik" rover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

The Soviet team again worked under intense [[impact_of_political_pressure_on_soviet_space_missions | political pressure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. They engineered the M71S Orbiter to reach Mars first to score a propaganda win, especially with Mariner 8 and 9 also planned for 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. Pressure initially eased when Mariner 8 failed on May 8, 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.

However, the Soviet M71S launch on May 9 also went wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>. An operator made a "gross and unforgivable mistake," coding the fourth stage to fire at 150 hours instead of 1.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. The rocket remained in Earth orbit for two days before crashing into the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

The two M71P missions (Mars 2 and Mars 3) launched without incident on May 19 and May 21, 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. However, the loss of M71S meant the Soviets lacked atmospheric data for precise entry trajectory calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. The Americans' Mariner 9, launched May 30, took a faster trajectory and became the first Orbiter around Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.

In August 1971, Lavochkin chief designer Georgi Babakin died of a heart attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. His death was an ill omen, worsened when Mariner 9 reported a massive dust storm raging across Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>, meaning the two entry probes would attempt landing in its midst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.

Without Orbiter data, the entry probes relied on a backup optical angle measurement system and an onboard computer for course adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>. This system was developed late, and while the optical instrument passed tests, the [[soviet_computer_development_history | computer programs]] were insufficiently tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>.

> [!warning] Mars 2 and Mars 3 Landers
> *   **Mars 2 (November 27, 1971):** The first M71P Lander. While instruments worked, the programs misinterpreted data, causing the entry probe to enter the atmosphere at the wrong angle and hit the ground before the parachute deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>. It is, however, the first Earth-made object to reach the Martian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
> *   **Mars 3 (December 2, 1971):** Trailing Mars 2, this lander's optical navigation system worked, and the landing sequence (parachute, lander drop) went as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. It settled at 2:50 PM Universal Time in the midst of the dust storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. It opened its petals and began transmitting to the Orbiter, which relayed to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. However, just 14.5 seconds after starting, the television camera system failed, sending only 79 lines of a single photograph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. The reason for failure is uncertain, possibly electric discharges from dust or a fabricated transmission for propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. The image was largely noise and kept secret until the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. The first clear image of Mars wouldn't come until the Viking missions in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

Despite the lander failures, Mars 2 and 3 continued to orbit and conduct science for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>. Their findings were overshadowed by Mariner 9's success, which took 7,329 photographs covering 85% of Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.

## 1973 Missions (Mars 4, 5, 6, 7)

During a period of detente between the US and USSR, leaders Nixon and Brezhnev agreed to joint missions, including a data swap where Soviets would provide Mars 2, Mars 3, and Venera 8 data, and Americans would share their atmospheric data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.

Despite this, the [[historical_space_race_between_us_and_ussr | race was still on]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>. Knowing the ambitious Viking missions were launching in 1975, Soviet leadership planned an "all-out assault" on Mars in the 1973 launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. The plan evolved from two Orbiter-Landers to two Orbiters and two Landers due to the less ideal 1973 window requiring more speed and fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.
*   **Mars 4 and 5:** Orbiters, similar to the M71S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.
*   **Mars 6 and 7:** Fly-by missions that would drop Landers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.

These four spacecraft adopted largely the same designs as the M71 devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. All four launched without incident in the summer of 1973, but engineers knew of a critical flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

> [!warning] The Transistor Flaw
> Tests during integration revealed repeated failures in the power systems due to fundamental faults in the 2T312 transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. These transistors, fabricated at a rural site, were supposed to have gold leads as per specification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. However, for material shortage or cost reasons, the factory swapped gold leads for aluminum ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>. About 1.5 years after production, these transistors began failing at high rates due to corrosion in the aluminum leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. Engineers estimated a 50/50 chance of catastrophic failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Removing them was not an option, so the ministry decided to go ahead with the launch to avoid political shame and leverage their last shot before Viking in 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.

The engineers' fears came true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>:
*   **Mars 4 (Orbiter):** Flew by Mars on February 10, 1974, without entering orbit due to a failure in its disproportionate brake system, likely linked to the faulty transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. It took photos before entering a solar orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.
*   **Mars 7 (Fly-by with Lander):** Reached Mars on March 9 and released its Lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. However, transistor failures in the Lander's computer systems caused it to miss the planet by about 1,300 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.
*   **Mars 5 (Orbiter):** Successfully entered Martian orbit in February 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. A slow pressure leak forced ground control to accelerate its three-month science program to just three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. Mars 5 took 108 high-resolution images of Martian valleys and craters and studied the atmosphere, detecting water vapor and an ozone layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. It ceased operations on February 28 when pressure levels declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>, but the mission was largely considered accomplished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.
*   **Mars 6 (Lander Craft):** About two months after its September 1973 launch, Mars 6 lost the ability to send telemetry data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. Ground control could only send programs and hope for proper execution, which Mars 6 remarkably did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. The craft autonomously measured its position, calculated a correct trajectory, and in March 1974, entered orbit around Mars, releasing its entry probe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. Through a backup radio channel, ground control learned Mars 6 had completed its mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. Sadly, the Lander failed to land safely, with transmission abruptly cutting off over the Margaritifer Sinus region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. The cause is unclear; it was a pleasant Martian spring, but the probe was falling faster than expected, possibly due to a final landing rocket failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.

Despite some scientific gains from the 1973 missions, leadership largely viewed the "all-out assault" as a failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. Chief designer Vasili Mishin was dismissed, and his rival Valentin Glushko was elevated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. Glushko pivoted the Soviet space program towards a Soviet space shuttle (Buran) and its Energia launcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>. This shift reduced resources for the Soviet planetary space program, leading to a "War of the Worlds" among internal factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.

## Later Mars Attempts and Conclusion

Despite the setbacks, the "Soviet Mars people" still fervently believed in Mars, planning ambitious future missions, such as Project 5NM in 1975, which would have used a powerful rocket to return Martian soil for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. However, leadership pragmatically decided to concentrate on Venus, where they had a clear advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. For the next decade, the Soviets primarily launched [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera missions]], achieving significant feats in Venusian science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>.

A final "last gasp" launch to explore the Martian moon Phobos occurred in 1989 as the Soviet Union stumbled towards its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>. Phobos 1 failed to enter Mars orbit due to a faulty command and computer logic error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>. Phobos 2 arrived and photographed the Martian moon, but a malfunctioning computer prevented it from releasing its lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>.

The Soviet Mars program was fundamentally defined by its [[competition_between_soviet_union_and_united_states_in_space_exploration | competition with the United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>. While this granted substantial resources, the arduous [[impact_of_political_pressure_on_soviet_space_missions | political requirements]], limited launch windows, poor execution, and plain bad luck foiled Soviet success on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>. Any achievements were largely eclipsed by those of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>. Nevertheless, the program's incredible efforts to send 15 robots millions of kilometers into space are to be admired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>.

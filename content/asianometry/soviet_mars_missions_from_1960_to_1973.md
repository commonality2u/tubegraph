From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

From 1960 to 1973, the Soviet Union launched 15 probes and orbiters to Mars in a competitive race with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While the Soviets achieved significant success with their [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera missions to Venus]], they struggled to match NASA's achievements on Mars, losing the race to fly by, orbit, and safely land on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Early Ambitions and Challenges (1950s-early 1960s)

The foundation for the Soviet space program was laid in the 1950s when Stalin sought a missile capable of striking Western enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. He tasked Sergey Korolev, who had a background in gliders and rockets, with reverse-engineering German V2 rocket designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Korolev eventually delivered the R7 missile, successfully fired in 1957 after Stalin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Stalin's passing created a more lenient political environment, allowing Korolev to pursue his vision of space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. He envisioned the R7 rocket as a tool for reaching the Moon, Venus, and Mars, not merely a military device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

In January 1956, after extensive lobbying, the Politburo approved the development of "Object D," later known as Sputnik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Sputnik 1 was successfully launched into orbit on October 4, 1957, after three failed attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The launch caused a global sensation, surprising even the Soviets who had not anticipated the Western reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Capitalizing on this unexpected success, Korolev and his team proposed ambitious plans, including expeditions to the Moon (January 1958) and a vast new program for robot spacecraft to Mars and Venus (July 1958) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This program aimed to upgrade the R7 to three and then four stages for interplanetary travel and eventually to send humans and establish colonies on these planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

While lunar probes dominated resources in 1958-1959, the planets remained the true goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Venus was closer, but Mars was considered the ultimate prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. An orbital window for Mars occurred roughly every 25 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The original 1958 target slipped to 1960, a decision influenced by the US also pushing back its Mariner 2 Venus probe to 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Interplanetary travel was largely theoretical at the time, requiring robots to fly over 100 million miles to Mars, a seven-month journey even within the orbital window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Achieving the necessary speeds (11 km/s compared to 7 km/s for Earth orbit) demanded additional rocket stages, making safe launch a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Political Pressure and Project 1M (1960)

The [[political_influences_on_the_soviet_space_program | Space Race]] added a critical political dimension. In January 1960, Nikita Khrushchev expressed concern about the growing American space program, urging Korolev to launch to Mars and Venus within the 1960 window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

A month later, Korolev drafted "Project 1M" for Mars, targeting a September 1960 launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The two 1M spacecraft, weighing around 640 kg, were to be launched by a new, more powerful four-stage R7 rocket, the 8K78 or Molniya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. However, in February 1960, this rocket existed only on paper, requiring Korolev's team to build the fourth stage from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

The rush to meet the Autumn launch date resulted in significant issues. Factories produced faulty components, and probes arrived in pieces, necessitating extensive repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. By the ideal launch date of September 27, the landers' radio systems conflicted with television cameras, failing ground tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The probes carried instruments like a radiometer and a charged particle detector, but had to abandon a UV spectrograph, television system, and infrared spectrometer due to integration issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

A team member's dark humor predicted, "the first time we won't fly any farther than Siberia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. He was right. The hurried development of the rocket and probe was too much, too fast, and it was the Molniya's first real firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

*   **October 10, 1960**: The first rocket suffered heavy vibrations during its second stage burn, breaking up over Eastern Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **October 14, 1960**: The second probe failed to reach space due to a frozen kerosene leak in the third stage, breaking up in the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

These failures were particularly embarrassing given that Khrushchev had reportedly brought models of the Mars craft to the United Nations to show President Eisenhower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Both 1M launches failed before their newly built fourth stages could even be tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Nedelin Catastrophe (1960)

A few weeks later, a prototype launch for an R-16 missile went disastrously wrong. A short circuit caused the second stage engines to fire, detonating the first stage tanks. The explosion incinerated an unknown number of technicians, including missile designer M.I. Nedelin, whose body was never found, only his melted gold star and wristwatch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## 2MV Project (1962) and Mars 1

Following the 1M failures, Korolev's team launched two Venus probes, similar to the 1M, in 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The first (1VA) failed to leave Earth orbit, while the second (1VB) successfully entered Venus's orbit, becoming Venera 1, though it sent no data back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. [[venera_mission_successes_and_impacts | Venera 1]] was humanity's first true interplanetary spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

Korolev then initiated the 2MV project, focusing on landers and flyby probes for both Venus and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Scientists struggled to make the Molniya rocket reliable due to manufacturing issues in its lower stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. A critical challenge was igniting the fourth stage in zero gravity, requiring engineers to force free-floating fuel particles into their tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This wasn't unique to the Soviets; between 1961 and 1962, seven straight probes (including two American) failed to reach Venus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

The Soviet space program built six 2MV probes, three of which were for the Autumn 1962 Mars launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. These probes, weighing around 900 kg, carried large cameras and instruments for detecting life, though some were removed to accommodate the rocket's fourth stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Cuban Missile Crisis Context

The first 2MV series probe, 2MV-4 No. 1 (known as Sputnik 22 in the West), launched on October 24, 1962, in the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Boris Chertok, Korolev's Deputy, recalled being at Baikonur Spaceport, which only had two launch pads shared by military ICBMs and civilian rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. He was ordered to remove the Mars vehicle to make way for an ICBM due to a "National Emergency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Despite the difficulty and limited launch window for Mars, Chertok was threatened with court-martial if he didn't comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Soldiers with machine guns surrounded the area in case of a US paratrooper attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

Ultimately, the crisis was resolved, and the Mars probe launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. However, 2MV-4 No. 1 failed in Earth orbit due to issues with the troublesome fourth stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The geopolitical tension was so high that a warning station in Wyoming initially misidentified the rocket debris as a swarm of nuclear missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Mars 1 (Sputnik 23)

The Soviets only named missions upon success. Mars 1, launched on November 1, 1962, was initially called 2MV No. 4 or Sputnik 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The mission started well, with the probe separating and deploying solar panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. However, a gas engine in the orientation system began leaking, forcing ground control to stabilize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. On March 21, 1963, months before its arrival at Mars, the orientation link with Earth broke, and contact was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. The probe, though silent, might have reached Mars and taken photos, but had no way to transmit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Nevertheless, its journey earned it the name Mars 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## Zond Series and Mariner 4's Impact (1964)

Troubled by the 2MV series' engineering failures, the Soviets introduced the Zond series, but these probes also proved problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Two Zond probes were sent to Venus, but only Zond 1 made it to space, and it too suffered equipment failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

In late November 1964, Zond 2 was launched towards Mars, but experienced fatal onboard failures a month into its trip, including a solar panel failing to unfurl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. This failure was exacerbated by the success of America's Mariner 4, which launched around the same time as Zond 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Mariner 4 flew by Mars in July 1965, sending back 22 incredible photographs covering about 1% of the Martian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

Mariner 4's images depicted Mars as a cold, dead world, much like the Moon, with no canals, no magnetic field, and a very thin atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This drastically downgraded dreams of sophisticated Martian life and dampened enthusiasm for future Mars missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

## Program Reorganization and M69 Project (1965-1969)

Recognizing America's serious commitment to a manned Moon landing, the Politburo in August 1964 instructed Korolev and his teams to pursue the same, entering into direct competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. This "race to the moon" disrupted the [[soviet_space_exploration_achievements_and_failures | Soviet space program's plans]] and led to managerial chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

The consistent failures of the early 1960s and the Moon race necessitated changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Korolev's primary goal became sending a man to the Moon, leading him to reassign robot missions to the new Lavochkin firm in March 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. He famously told the Lavochkin team:

> "I hand over to you the most valuable possession, my dream. I expect you to work hard, but if my faith is not rewarded, I'll do has Taras Bulba once said: 'I gave you life and I will take your life.'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>

This reference to a 19th-century novel by Gogol highlights the intense pressure and high stakes involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Korolev himself passed away less than a year later, in January 1966, a profound loss for the Soviet space program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

### M69 Project: A New Approach

Mariner 4's findings fundamentally altered Soviet Mars mission [[design_and_challenges_of_soviet_mars_probes | design and challenges of Soviet Mars probes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The new team at Lavochkin concluded that earlier Mars craft designs had fundamental flaws, and the previous agency (OKB-1) had been too thinly spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

The Soviet Mars team aimed to surpass Mariner 4 by soft-landing a probe and searching for microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. In October 1965, the Soviet program leadership decided to reboot the entire Mars program, meaning they would miss the October 1967 launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. The new project, M69, needed to launch by 1969 to preempt further American successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

The two M69 probes discarded the old 3MV Zond designs, partly for a fresh start and partly because Mariner 4 showed the Martian atmosphere was too thin for previous lander designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. The Mars program received a significant boost from the new UR-500 or Proton rocket, originally a super-large ICBM, capable of sending 4-5 metric tons into interplanetary space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

The M69 plan envisioned a Mars orbiter and lander to study the atmosphere, achieve soft landings, and search for microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. Due to limited time, they initially tried adapting a lunar design (the Year 8), but faced fundamental issues with the propulsion system, center of balance, and leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

In February 1968, Georgi Babakin, the Mars team's engineering head, made the risky decision to scrap the current design and restart, just 13 months before the launch date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. The new design featured a clean, centralized spherical tank for propulsion, with instruments and solar panels attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Mars 69 carried three color cameras and was the first Soviet planetary device with an on-board computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. An entry probe and lander were planned but ultimately removed due to prototype issues, weight, and landing test problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. The new design weighed over 5 tons, largely due to fuel and the inability to shrink instruments without advanced [[soviet_computer_development_history | semiconductor technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

The mission plan involved an extremely complicated launch sequence: a three-stage Proton rocket to Earth orbit, separation, a fourth stage firing into space, and then the M69 probe firing its own engine multiple times for trajectory adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. This "wild sequence" had never been attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

### M69 Launch Failures (1969)

The Lavochkin team worked under immense pressure. The Communist Party issued a special military-industrial resolution demanding the 1969 launch date be met, with severe consequences for failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. Weekly updates were required, and underperforming suppliers and individuals were blacklisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Divisions worked around the clock, with specialists called in at any hour and free meals provided 24/7; workers received no overtime pay, expected to contribute out of "enthusiasm for the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

Despite the monumental effort, both M69 probes failed:

*   **M69a (March 27, 1969)**: A rotor failure in a pump inside the rocket's third stage caused it to explode, scattering wreckage over the Altai mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.
*   **M69b (April 2, 1969)**: The right engine on its first stage failed at launch, tilting the rocket, causing it to fall back and explode, spewing toxic materials across the launch pad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

These failures, coupled with the success of Apollo 11's Moon landing in July 1969 and Mariner 6 and 7's Martian flybys (taking hundreds of photos and studying the atmosphere), were a bitter defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. The "Proton Rocket's high rate of rapid unscheduled disassemblies" highlighted a major problem, though an overhaul the following year dramatically improved its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.

## Mars 71 Missions: An All-Out Assault (1971)

M69's failure left engineers without crucial atmospheric data needed for a soft landing on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. The year 1971 offered a special orbital window, occurring every 15-17 years, when Mars and Earth are unusually close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

Managers faced a dilemma: redo M69 for data (delaying landers to 1973 with greater distance and fuel needs) or seize the 1971 window without atmospheric data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. They decided to send three probes:

*   **M71S (Orbiter)**: Christened "Mars 71s" (S for Sputnik/Orbiter), it would launch as early as possible, carrying 800 kg more fuel instead of a lander, to reach Mars quickly and gather atmospheric measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.
*   **Two M71P (Lander)**: Christened "Mars 71p" (P for Possadka/Lander), these would arrive later, using the M71S data to calculate correct entry trajectories for soft landings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

### Landing Challenges: Ballistic Entry

Soft landing in Mars's thin atmosphere onto unknown terrain was the hardest part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. The Americans, designing their Viking landing craft, opted for a controlled gliding entry, achieved by shifting the lander's center of gravity to generate g-forces, stabilizing the ship and lengthening its braking path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. This allowed earlier parachute deployment and greater control over descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. This was possible due to detailed atmospheric knowledge from their successful Mars missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.

The Soviets, lacking this data and with the Americans unwilling to share, had to use an "uncontrolled ballistic entry," essentially a "bullet punching through the sky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. Their entry trajectories would be determined solely by gravity, atmospheric drag, and entry conditions (velocity, angle, and the probe's inherent properties, including its 3.2-meter wide brake cone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

The plan was to release the entry probe 46,000 km above Mars, fire engines to assume a 120-degree entry angle, and deploy the parachute as high as possible (35 km above ground) while the probe hurtled at Mach 3.5 (over 2,600 mph) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. This unprecedented parachute deployment was tested 15 times using models dropped from high altitudes, accelerating them with gunpowder engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

The sequence relied heavily on timers: a radio altimeter would activate at 12 seconds to monitor distance, a soft landing engine would fire at 200 seconds, and the lander would drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>. Small rockets would then fire to carry away the parachute and other entry probe bits, preventing them from blocking the landing site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. Gunpowder engines, fabricated at the Scientific Research Chemical Technological Institute, were dangerous to produce, as evidenced by an explosion that blew out a wall designed to collapse safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.

To ensure the lander's survival, five models were built and launched via a catapult onto simulated Martian ground at 30 mph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. Once landed, the probes would open "like one of those eggs from that movie Alien," exposing instruments to take measurements, snap pictures, and deploy the Prop-M marsokhodnik, a small (10x10 inch) robot that "walked" on skis to measure ground density and interact with soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. [[engineering_breakthroughs_in_venera_landers | Engineering breakthroughs in Venera landers]] were often used here, but this was a completely different environment.

### 1971 Launch Outcomes

Political pressure mounted due to US plans for Mariner 8 and 9 in 1971; the M71S orbiter was designed to reach Mars first for a propaganda win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

*   **May 8, 1971**: Mariner 8 failed to enter Earth orbit and crashed into the Atlantic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.
*   **May 9, 1971 (M71S)**: The Soviet launch also went wrong. An operator's "gross and unforgivable mistake" erroneously coded the rocket's fourth stage to fire at 150 hours instead of 1.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>. The rocket remained in Earth orbit for two days before crashing into the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. This loss meant the Soviets would not have atmospheric data to calculate entry trajectories for the two forthcoming landers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.
*   **May 19 and 21, 1971 (M71P missions)**: The two Mars 71p missions launched without incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.
*   **May 30, 1971**: America's Mariner 9 launched, taking a faster trajectory, allowing them to claim the first orbiter around Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.

Despite some transmitter issues, the two Soviet spacecraft appeared to be operating well, but their greatest challenges were ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. In August 1971, Lavochkin chief designer Georgi Babakin died of a heart attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. His death was an ill omen, compounded by Mariner 9's report of a massive dust storm raging across the entire planet, meaning the two Soviet landers would attempt to land in its midst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

Without data from their own orbiter, the entry probes relied on a backup optical angle measurement system and an onboard computer for course adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>. This system was developed late, and while the optical instrument passed tests, the computer programs had insufficient testing time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>.

### Mars 2 and Mars 3 Landings (1971)

*   **Mars 2 (November 27, 1971)**: The first Mars 71p lander arrived and was christened Mars 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>. The landing proceeded, but the programs misinterpreted the data, causing the probe to enter the atmosphere at the wrong angle and hit the ground before the parachute deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. However, it remains the first Earth-made object to reach the Mars surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
*   **Mars 3 (December 2, 1971)**: Trailing Mars 2, Mars 3 arrived at Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. This time, the optical navigation system worked, and the entire landing sequence (parachute and lander deployment) went as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. The lander settled at 2:50 PM universal time in the midst of a violent Martian storm, opening its petals and beginning transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. However, just 14.5 seconds after starting, the television camera system failed, sending only 79 lines of a single photograph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. The cause remains uncertain, though theories include electric discharges from dust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. Many insist it sent back nothing but noise; the image was kept secret until the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. The first good image of the Martian surface would not come until the Viking missions in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

Despite the lander failures, Mars 2 and 3 continued to orbit and conduct science for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. Their findings, however, were overshadowed by Mariner 9's stunning success, which took 7,329 beautiful photographs covering 85% of the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

## Mars 73 Missions: The "All-Out Assault"

During the period of Détente, leaders Nixon and Brezhnev struck deals for joint missions, including in planetary exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. As part of these agreements (culminating in the Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975), the Soviets provided data from Mars 2, Mars 3, and Venera 8, and the Americans shared the atmospheric data the Soviets lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.

Nevertheless, the space race continued. Knowing Viking was launching in 1975 and would be significant, Soviet leadership planned an "all-out assault" on Mars in the 1973 launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>. Originally two orbiter-landers like Mars 2 and 3, the plan evolved into two orbiters and two flyby-landers due to the less ideal 1973 window, requiring more speed and fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

*   **Mars 4 and 5**: Orbiters, similar to the M71S design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.
*   **Mars 6 and 7**: Flyby probes that would drop their landers and then continue into space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.

These spacecraft largely adopted the designs of the earlier M71 devices, meaning production and assembly *should* have gone smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. All four launched in summer 1973 with great public fanfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

### Fatal Flaw: The 2T312 Transistors

However, engineers knew of a critical flaw: repeated failures in the power systems during the integration phase, linked to fundamental faults in the 2T312 transistors used extensively throughout all four spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. The factory in Voronezh, rather than using specified gold leads, swapped them for aluminum ones, likely due to material shortages or cost reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. About 1.5 years after production, these transistors began failing at high rates due to corrosion in the aluminum leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.

Engineers estimated a 50/50 chance of catastrophic failure before mission accomplishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. Removing and replacing them was not an option, so the ministry decided to gamble and proceed with the launch, as delaying would have been a political "shame show" with Viking looming in 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.

### 1973 Mission Outcomes

The engineers' fears proved accurate:

*   **Mars 4 (February 10, 1974)**: Flew by the planet without entering orbit due to a failure in its disproportionate brake system, likely related to the faulty transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. It took some photos from 2,200 km before entering solar orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>.
*   **Mars 7 (March 9, 1974)**: Successfully reached Mars and released its lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. However, transistor failures in the lander's computer systems caused it to miss the planet by about 1,300 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.
*   **Mars 5 (February 1974)**: The most successful of the 1973 missions, it managed to enter Martian orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. A slow pressure leak in its sealed instrument module forced ground control to accelerate its three-month science program to just three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. Mars 5 took 108 high-resolution images of valleys and craters, and studied the atmosphere, detecting water vapor and an ozone layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. Pressure levels declined too far on February 28, but the mission was largely considered accomplished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.
*   **Mars 6 (March 1974)**: This lander had the most impressive story. About two months after launch in September 1973, Mars 6 lost the ability to send telemetry data back to Earth, meaning ground control could only send programs and hope for proper execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Remarkably, it did: autonomously measuring its position, calculating a correct trajectory, and entering orbit around Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. It then released its entry probe, which, via a backup radio channel, confirmed Mars 6 was still alive and had completed its mission – an incredible achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. Sadly, the lander itself failed to land safely, with transmissions abruptly cutting off as it approached the Margaritifer Sinus region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. While the weather was good (Martian spring with a light breeze), the probe was falling faster than expected (135 mph), suggesting a final landing rocket failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.

## Aftermath and Legacy

Despite some scientific gains from the 1973 missions, leadership largely viewed the "all-out assault" as a failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. They dismissed the program's chief designer, Vasili Mishin, and elevated his rival, Valentin Glushko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. Glushko pivoted the [[comparison_of_soviet_and_american_space_programs | Soviet space program]] towards a Soviet space shuttle, the Buran, and its Energia launcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>.

This shift meant fewer resources for the Soviet planetary space program, triggering a "War of the Worlds" within the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. While the Mars advocates still passionately believed in ambitious future Mars missions, such as the 1975 Project 5NM which would have used one of the world's most powerful rockets to return Martian soil samples, leadership pragmatically decided to concentrate on Venus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. They held a clear advantage there, and for the next decade, the Soviets primarily launched [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera missions]], achieving "amazing feats in Venusian science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>.

A final push for Mars came with the Phobos 1 and 2 missions in 1989, as the Soviet Union neared its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>. Phobos 1 failed to enter Mars orbit due to a faulty command and a computer logic error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. Phobos 2 arrived and photographed the Martian moon, but a malfunctioning computer prevented it from releasing its lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

The Soviet Mars program was defined by its competition with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>. While this political importance granted substantial resources, the arduous political requirements, limited launch windows, poor execution, and plain bad luck foiled Soviet success on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>. Their achievements were largely eclipsed by the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>. Nevertheless, the sheer effort of trying to send 15 robots millions of kilometers into space to another planet was a truly incredible undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>.

The [[the_invention_and_significance_of_the_first_transistor | discovery of the transistor]] on December 16, 1947, marked a "zero hour" in microelectronics technology, changing everything and laying the foundation for modern technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Born from research for radios, radars, and telephones, it overthrew the [[the_transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_solidstate_devices | vacuum tube]] and ushered in the modern computing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Initial Secrecy and Public Announcement

After its creation by Walter Brattain and John Bardeen, the device was immediately put into a circuit and demonstrated to AT&T leadership who listened to amplified speech through headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. AT&T then kept the discovery secret for a few months to patent the design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. It was also shown to the US military, who considered classifying it, even contemplating an "underground" venture akin to the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Fortunately, this did not happen due to the device's broad applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The news was publicly released on June 30, 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

> The New York Times' first mention of the transistor dryly noted its "applications in radio where a vacuum tube ordinarily is employed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. This was an understatement of its future impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Global Rush into Solid-State Physics

The announcement of [[the_development_and_impact_of_the_point_contact_transistor | the point contact transistor]] sparked a massive global rush into the study of solid-state physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. However, [[the_development_and_impact_of_the_point_contact_transistor | the point contact transistor]], while historically important, was largely accidental and poorly understood at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. As a commercial product, it failed because its operation depended on fragile semiconductor surface structures, making it susceptible to humidity and temperature, leading to inconsistent performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Western Electric, Bell Labs' sister company, attempted mass production in 1951, making 8,400 devices a month by 1952, but faced major challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

## The Junction Transistor: A Commercial Breakthrough

The commercial viability of the transistor significantly improved with the development of the junction transistor by William Shockley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Shockley, realizing [[the_development_and_impact_of_the_point_contact_transistor | the point contact transistor's]] commercial weaknesses, intensified his theoretical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. In January 1948, he unified key concepts to create the junction transistor, which involved three sections of doped (p-type and n-type) semiconducting materials (N-P-N or P-N-P arrangements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

A critical realization for Shockley was that at the "junctions" where p-type and n-type materials met, majority charge carriers could travel through the entire material, rather than just along the surface layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This concept, known as "minority carrier injection," was key to creating a far more resilient and commercially useful device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

In 1950, Bell Labs chemists Gordon Teal and Morgan Sparks adopted the Czochralski process to grow pure germanium crystals, which allowed for the systematic doping of P and N-type impurities to create P-N junctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This led to the first "grown junction transistors" in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. Unlike [[the_development_and_impact_of_the_point_contact_transistor | the point contact transistor]]'s fragile wire contacts, the junction transistor was a sturdy three-part "sandwich," making it immediately superior for commercial applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

## Licensing and Market Expansion

A significant catalyst for the transistor's widespread adoption was an antitrust lawsuit filed by the US Government against AT&T in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. To settle, AT&T's Consent Decree required them to license their discoveries, including the transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. This allowed domestic and foreign companies to purchase patent licenses for $25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. Bell Labs held its first symposium on transistor manufacturing in September 1951, providing an 800-page book and samples to each licensee, famously dubbed the "$25,000 book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

Former [[the_transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_solidstate_devices | vacuum tube]] companies like RCA, General Electric, Westinghouse, and Sylvania recognized the threat and aggressively built up germanium transistor capacity, driving new innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. Around 1951 or 1952, General Electric and RCA discovered the "alloy junction transistor," which involved melting P and N-type pellets with germanium to create junctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. This manufacturing method was seen as far more scalable than the grown junction transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

## Transistorized Products and Global Adoption

By 1953, the first transistorized products entered the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. One notable example was the transistorized hearing aid, which significantly shrank the device and revolutionized the experience for the hard-of-hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Initially, these products were expensive; a hearing aid with just one transistor cost $229 in 1953 dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

The news of the transistor spread rapidly worldwide, prompting other countries to develop their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. France quickly produced its "transistron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. Japan's Electrotechnical Laboratory developed its first [[the_development_and_impact_of_the_point_contact_transistor | point contact transistor]] in 1951 and its first junction transistor in 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Japan's Sony Corporation went on to commercialize the transistor radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

## Impact on Computers

From the outset, transistors were expected to be integrated into computers, offering significant advantages over [[the_transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_solidstate_devices | vacuum tubes]] in terms of size, energy consumption, heat generation, and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. Despite initial delays in scaling production of reliable transistors, the dream began to materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

In November 1953, the University of Manchester launched what is generally considered the first transistorized computer, featuring 92 first-generation [[the_development_and_impact_of_the_point_contact_transistor | point contact transistors]], though it still incorporated [[the_transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_solidstate_devices | vacuum tubes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. Spurred by military demand, Bell Labs and other companies invested heavily in creating more reliable transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. The commercialization of improved alloy junction transistors, including Philco's "surface-barrier transistor," rapidly advanced their use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

In May 1954, the United States Air Force received the first American transistorized computer, TRADIC (TRAnsistor DIgital Computer), which contained 700 transistors and was designed to assess the viability of digital navigation computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. Within less than a decade, transistors evolved from fragile laboratory curiosities to robust components used in airborne computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. These transistorized computers became known as "second-generation devices," marking a clear departure from past technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

By the end of 1954, William Shockley left Bell Labs to start his own business, Shockley Semiconductor Lab, within Beckman Instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. While Bell Labs held 37% of all transistor patents issued in 1955, their pioneering status gradually declined as former [[the_transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_solidstate_devices | vacuum tube]] companies aggressively entered the semiconductor business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

Semiconductor manufacturing, a highly profitable and value-added industry, presents unique challenges in water-scarce regions due to its significant water demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Despite these challenges, governments are often incentivized to attract these facilities due to their substantial economic benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

## Water Usage in Semiconductor Manufacturing

Semiconductor manufacturing requires a vast amount of water, primarily for washing wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Between 30% and 40% of steps in modern wafer fabrication involve some form of wafer cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This includes wet cleaning to remove organics, metals, and particles, followed by rinsing steps to remove chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

Fabs cannot use regular tap water; they require "ultra-pure water" to prevent damage to the wafers from particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. The cleanliness standards for ultra-pure water in the semiconductor industry are stricter than almost all other applications, including nuclear energy or chemical manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. The goal is to remove "killer particles"—microorganisms, organic particles, dissolved metals, and gases—that could affect a chip's nano-architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

Generating ultra-pure water is a complex, multi-step process:
*   It takes approximately 6,000 liters (1,600 gallons) of city water to produce 3,800 liters (1,000 gallons) of ultra-pure water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   A single 200-millimeter (8-inch) wafer can consume over 5,600 liters (2,000 gallons) of ultra-pure water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
*   The type of circuits manufactured also impacts water usage; logic circuits like microprocessors, having more layers and complexity, demand more water and energy than memory ICs or display panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   More advanced process nodes require increased cleanliness, leading to higher water consumption, more layers to wash, and stricter standards for ultra-pure water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. This means cutting-edge chips today require more water than those from a decade ago, despite advancements in water reuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

## Wastewater Management and Reuse

Semiconductor manufacturing generates a significant amount of wastewater, much of which requires treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. This wastewater contains pollutants like ammonia, phosphate, and fluoride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Large foundries like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel separate wastewater streams and apply specific treatments for over 25 different chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

A portion of the treated water can be reused to generate more ultra-pure water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Non-reusable water is often used in cooling towers, where it is evaporated to help maintain fab temperatures, which is the second largest use of water after direct manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. While this system is complex and expensive, large fabs implement these technologies due to their scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. For example, TSMC's recycle rate in 2017 was 87% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>, significantly higher than the average semiconductor fab's 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. Smaller companies often find it more cost-effective to broadly treat and return water to the city, then draw new raw water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

## Regional Water Challenges and Solutions

### Taiwan
Taiwan has experienced severe droughts, particularly in southern areas like Tainan, Gaochon, Taitung, and Hsinchu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. TSMC's fabs in Tainan alone consume 50,000 metric tons (50 million liters) of water daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. In 2013, TSMC's Tainan fabs generated 19 million tons of wastewater, compared to the entire city's 29 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.

To mitigate this, TSMC has:
*   Budgeted millions of dollars to truck water to its fabs in Tainan during droughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.
*   Optimized water draw and usage through recycling technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
*   Built large rain collection systems with 700-ton tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.
*   Signed tenders to build water reclamation plants near its fabs, recycling industrial wastewater through advanced procedures similar to Singapore's "New Water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

### Arizona
Arizona, much of which is desert, might seem an unusual location for fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. Currently, 40% of its total water demand is met by non-renewable groundwater, with the Colorado River and other surface water sources providing 57% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. This reliance on groundwater is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. Arizona has managed water usage by transferring water from farms to cities, as agriculture accounts for almost 90% of total water demand in the American Southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

## Economic Incentives for Semiconductor Fabs

Governments are incentivized to bring semiconductor fabs to water-scarce regions due to their high economic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

1.  **High Profitability and Value Add:** High-volume semiconductor manufacturing is incredibly profitable and adds significant value, making states willing to bear the [[cost_and_economics_of_building_semiconductor_fabs | cost of building]] water infrastructure or reallocating existing water supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. Governments earn much more from foundries on their land compared to other land uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. A 2012 paper analyzing land usages in Chandler, Arizona (where fabs are built) found that the economic benefits from semiconductor manufacturing outweighed the costs of providing water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. Governments receive more revenue on a per-acre basis from semiconductor manufacturing than from other land uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>, largely through property taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.

2.  **Investment in Water Recycling Technologies:** The semiconductor industry is affluent enough to invest heavily in water-saving, reusing, and recycling techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. This means a theoretically high percentage of water is returned to the wastewater system, far exceeding other land usages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. This capability makes fabs attractive even in areas with water scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

3.  **Other Regional Advantages:** Beyond water considerations, regions like Arizona offer other advantages for fabs, including a ready supply of educated talent, tax incentives, and seismic stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

### Political Consequences of Water Reallocation
The high value of semiconductor manufacturing often leads governments to find water for it by reallocating shares, usually from farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. This has occurred in both Taiwan and Arizona, where farmers' water allocations are cut and diverted to tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. Agriculture is the primary water user globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. While there is an argument that much agriculture is not an economically efficient use of water, especially groundwater, reallocating water from farmers carries significant political consequences, as farmers are valuable constituents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. Governments must delicately balance these economic and political considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The semiconductor industry's demand for water will continue to grow as Moore's Law pushes technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. Therefore, continuous advancements in water recycling, reduction techniques, and reuse technologies are crucial to ensure sufficient water availability for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.

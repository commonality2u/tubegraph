[[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography]] is a critical technology in modern semiconductor manufacturing, with ASML being the primary supplier of the necessary machinery for foundries like Intel and TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite its importance, the production of these high-end [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV lithography]] machines is severely limited, with ASML capable of making only about 50 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This scarcity directly impacts the ability of foundries to produce advanced 5nm chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## ASML's System Integrator Role

ASML's lithography machines, such as the TWINSCAN series, are built from independent modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The company operates as a system integrator, coordinating a vast global network of suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Approximately 90% of the components in these modules are manufactured by 500-600 external companies within ASML's outsourced supplier network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This contrasts with competitors like Canon and Nikon, which tend to do more manufacturing in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Most of these critical suppliers are located in Europe (300 in the Netherlands, 100 in other parts of Europe, primarily Germany) and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. ASML maintains strategic alliances, such as with German company Carl Zeiss AG, a specialist in precision optics that produces critical lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Benefits of Outsourcing

ASML's reliance on outsourcing is strategic for several reasons:
*   **Specialization**: It allows ASML to acquire components without needing to master the manufacturing of every single part, especially since a single lithography stepper can contain over 1,600 individual components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Outsourcing provides the flexibility to adapt to changing technology trends, like the radical shift required for [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This avoids sunk costs associated with defunct in-house technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Economic Value and Influence**: The system integrator role positions ASML at the apex of the enterprise, giving them final say on component integration and maximizing economic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. ASML is often the single most important customer for its specialized suppliers, allowing it to exert strong influence over their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## [[Challenges in developing EUV systems | Challenges in Developing EUV Systems]]

[[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV lithography]] is considered a revolutionary rather than evolutionary technique, demanding a complete re-engineering of traditional semiconductor manufacturing principles and ASML's entire supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

### High Costs
[[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] equipment is exceptionally expensive, costing around $150 million per machine, comparable to a Boeing airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Individual components and replacements often exceed a million dollars each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### Light Source and Reflectivity
A significant [[Challenges in developing EUV systems | challenge in EUV lithography]] is ensuring high wafer etching rates while maintaining yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   [[Advancements in EUV Power Efficiency | EUV]] mirrors have low reflectivity (less than 70%), necessitating a very powerful light source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   This light is generated by firing a CO2 laser at tin droplets to create plasma and ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   The use of droplets is crucial to minimize tin debris and prevent contamination of the light-collecting mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This was a result of [[The evolution of EUV lithography | extensive experimentation]], moving from rotating cylinders to thin target tapes, spray jets, liquid filaments, and finally, tiny droplets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. The tight margin of error for the power source has consequences across the entire supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Pellicle Limitations and Ultra-Strict Cleanliness
Traditional pellicles, thin polymer films used to prevent particle shadows on wafers in older lithography methods, absorb and weaken [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. For a period, this meant early generations of [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] machines and their supply chains had to adhere to ultra-strict cleanliness standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. A particle as small as 52 nm (the size of a small virus) could contaminate an [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Pushing the limits of cleanliness:
> Maintaining such cleanliness pushed the boundaries of technical possibility. This required installing new proprietary detectors at all supplier premises and adding particle flushing steps throughout the build process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. These [[Challenges in developing EUV systems | challenges]] contributed to the decades-long delay in [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] commercialization, even after its scientific feasibility was proven in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

>[!INFO] Recent Development:
>Pellicles are now available for [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] machines, which is expected to improve wafer yields and reduce cleaning requirements in the workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

## Supply Chain Complexities for EUV
The intricate nature of [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] manufacturing adds significant pressure to ASML's supply chain:
*   **Long Lead Times**: Some critical components, such as lenses and lasers, require lead times longer than the final product assembly time. A single lens can take up to 40 weeks to produce, necessitating the start of work far in advance of actual customer orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Zero Defects Policy**: ASML enforces rigid "zero defects" quality control standards on its suppliers. Every part is closely inspected, and any potential defect leads to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Disruption Management**: ASML's planners must account for potential disruptions, including rejected parts, unforeseen issues, and transport challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. A mission-critical missing or defective part can halt production of an entire module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## ASML's Market Leadership
ASML's market dominance is a result of two key factors:
1.  **Technological Superiority**: ASML's products, though more expensive, significantly outperform competitors like Nikon and Canon in printing detail and rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
2.  **Collaboration**: The company's strong track record of collaboration with both customers and suppliers allows it to deliver highly demanding products, akin to an airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. This constant process improvement and ability to navigate complex [[Challenges in developing EUV systems | EUV challenges]] help ASML remain at the forefront of the market, enabling Moore's Law to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

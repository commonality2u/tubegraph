Indonesia's economy, particularly its major business groups like the Salim Group, was profoundly impacted by the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.

## The Rise of Salim Group and Suharto's New Order

At its peak, the Salim Group, founded by Lim Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim), was a $22 billion conglomerate and Indonesia's largest business group, with Salim himself becoming Southeast Asia's richest man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The group's remarkable ascent was built on its personal connection to authoritarian leader Suharto, who relied on the company as a core collaborator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Lim Sioe Liong arrived in Java in 1938, fleeing the Second Sino-Japanese War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. He started as an ethnic Chinese trader, selling clothes and then coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. During Indonesia's struggle for independence against the Dutch, Lim launched a supplies business, smuggling essentials to the Republican Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. It was during this period that he met Suharto, then a logistics officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Following Indonesia's independence in 1949, President Sukarno's socialist leanings made the early days difficult for foreign investors and the Chinese ethnic minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Anti-Chinese violence also broke out due to their dominance in business and perceived support of the Dutch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Lim moved to Jakarta in 1952 to escape racial discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

In 1956, Suharto was appointed commander of the local division in Semarang, where he and Lim rekindled their friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Lim became Suharto's trusted associate for financial matters, and as Suharto rose through military ranks, he became Lim's patron and protector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

After a failed coup attempt in 1965, Suharto led a counter-coup that resulted in mass killings of suspected communists and ethnic Chinese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. In March 1966, Sukarno transferred power to Suharto, ushering in the "New Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Suharto's government focused on reforming the economy, which suffered from hyperinflation and insufficient revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Indonesia rebuilt its tax base, opened to foreign capital, and invited foreign companies to set up light manufacturing facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This led to consistent economic growth throughout Suharto's reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

However, this growth also presented opportunities for corruption. The military and business community were closely intertwined, a relationship that strengthened under Suharto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Suharto developed a [[crony_capitalism_in_indonesia | crony capitalist]] pyramid, collecting rents from various economic activities that flowed upwards to himself and his elite circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Lim was one of Suharto's Chinese partners who relied on him for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Lim's businesses grew through exclusive licenses, such as the import of cloves for cigarettes, with most profits going to a presidential slush fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This funding allowed him to expand into more lucrative sectors like food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. In 1969, Lim co-founded Bogasari Flour Mills, which quickly secured a monopoly on wheat import, milling, and distribution for Western Indonesia, with 26% of profits allocated to foundations headed by Suharto and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Salim Group's food business later became Indofood, a massive conglomerate producing instant noodles, biscuits, milk, and chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

Salim Group also entered the cement industry, building one of the world's largest cement companies and controlling 60% of Indonesia's total cement production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. When oil prices tumbled in 1984, Suharto ordered the government to bail out Lim's cement company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. By the end of the 1970s, Salim Group had grown from three companies to 54, spanning trading, automobile manufacturing, property, finance, and natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. By 1989, estimates placed the number of Lim-affiliated companies at 350, many of them monopolies or near-monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

One of Salim Group's most valuable businesses was Bank Central Asia (BCA), which Lim acquired with a knitting company that had a banking license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Under the leadership of Mukhtar Riady, BCA became Indonesia's biggest private bank in just three years, with deposits soaring from 1 billion Indonesian Rupiah in 1974 to 7.5 trillion Rupiah in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. However, [[economic_policies_and_reforms in Suhartos Indonesia | reforms]] passed in 1989 made it easier to start new banks, introducing competition that would cause trouble later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

By the mid-1990s, Suharto was becoming out of touch, and his children's incompetence and self-interest began to turn public opinion against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. An infamous example was Suharto's youngest son Tommy being granted a clove monopoly in 1990, which he mismanaged, requiring a $350 million bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Lim and his family, sensing a shift, began diversifying investments offshore through First Pacific, their Hong Kong-based financial services company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

Indonesia's economy experienced a rebound in the mid-1990s, with GDP growth of about 8% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. The Salim Group saw massive expansion, with companies growing at 40-50% a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. By 1996, the total revenues across all of Lim's companies topped $22.8 billion, constituting 4% of Indonesia's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. In 1997, Lim's net worth reached $4 billion, making him the world's 68th richest man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

## The Crisis Hits

Beneath the surface, however, the economic boom was fueled by short-term external debts, primarily invested in domestic ventures like construction and real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. This external debt doubled from $70 billion in 1990 to $140 billion by mid-1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

On July 2, 1997, Thailand free-floated its currency, the Baht, triggering a contagion effect across Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. Investors scrambled to pull capital out of the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. Bank Indonesia, lacking sufficient reserves to defend the currency, floated the Rupiah in August, causing it to lose over 30% of its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. This devaluation severely impacted Indonesian banks, as their foreign-denominated debt suddenly soared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. Intense competition and high non-performing loans, partly due to the 1989 banking [[economic_policies_and_reforms in Suhartos Indonesia | reforms]], meant many small banks were insolvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

By the end of October 1997, 16 commercial banks had closed, leading to bank runs as people lost confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. Rumors spread about Lim's death and BCA's Singapore branches closing (which didn't exist), causing a $150 million run on BCA despite Lim's public appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

## IMF Intervention and Suharto's Fall

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) intervened, announcing a $33 billion bailout package in October 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. The bailout came with stringent [[economic_policies_and_reforms in Suhartos Indonesia | economic reform]] conditions, including disassembling state and private monopolies, cutting subsidies on basic goods, and further opening up the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.

Indonesia's economy contracted sharply in 1998, with GDP shrinking by 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. The construction sector shrank by 37%, financial sector by 26.6%, and manufacturing by 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. Approximately 1.8 million formal and 2.8 million informal employees lost their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. Unemployment was compounded by skyrocketing food costs due to the weak currency and a severe El Ni√±o drought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.

The IMF's reforms directly targeted monopolies, many of which were controlled by Suharto's cronies and family, hitting his supporters when he needed them most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. Suharto resisted these conditions, claiming the crisis was due to currency manipulation rather than internal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. Relations with the IMF deteriorated, and the fund began withholding payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

In May 1998, mass riots erupted in response to fuel subsidy cuts, often targeting ethnic Chinese and their businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. Pro-democracy student demonstrations also called for Suharto's resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. As his cabinet members abandoned him, Suharto resigned on May 21, 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

## Aftermath for Salim Group

Lim was out of the country during the riots, having mostly relocated to Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>, but his home was attacked and set on fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. BCA and other Salim companies suffered fire damage, but the true blow came after Suharto's fall, as the bank's association with the government crony turned against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. A massive run on BCA caused its collapse, forcing the central bank to take over the bank and its $5 billion in debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

With Suharto's fall, the largely insolvent Salim Empire began to break apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. Many of BCA's debts were to other Salim Group companies, threatening them all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. Despite public fury, Lim's son, Anthony Salim, negotiated a settlement, handing over stakes in over 100 Indonesian businesses, such as Indocement and Indomobile, to repay the $5 billion bailout for BCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. Crucially, Salim managed to retain a 50.1% share in Indofood and moved these holdings offshore to First Pacific in Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.

Lim never returned to Indonesia after 1998 and died in Singapore in 2012 at age 95, with an estimated net worth of $655 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. Despite the collapse of much of his empire, his ability to retain key assets like Indofood (which became one of the world's biggest food companies) meant it "worked out for him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

Suharto's governance did bring substantial economic benefits, with 32 years of 7% annual economic growth and the development of agricultural and manufacturing bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. However, this growth significantly enriched Suharto, his cronies, and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

The People's Republic of Albania was known as the most isolated country in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. From the 1950s to the 1970s, this small communist nation notably joined with and then split from three distinct major Communist powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. After its final split, Albania vigorously pursued economic self-reliance, which contributed to it becoming the third poorest country globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This article explores the rise and fall of [[communist_albanias_isolation_and_political_dynamics | Communist Albania]] through the lens of its shifting alliances.

## Early Ties with Yugoslavia

The Communist Party of Albania was created in 1941, with the Communist Party of Yugoslavia sending a member to unify scattered parties there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This party was led by Enver Hoxha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Yugoslavia's backing was crucial, as Albania remains the only country in central or Eastern Europe to have been "liberated" without any Allied help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Per the advice of the Yugoslavs, the Communist Party of Albania initially preached national liberation rather than the economic messaging of Marxist-Leninism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

After World War II, Yugoslavia quickly recognized Hoxhaâ€™s provisional government in April 1945, followed later that year by the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The Communist Party of Yugoslavia helped found the Communist Party of Albania, provided military assistance, and sponsored the People's Republic as a government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. In return, Yugoslavia pushed Albania towards joining the Yugoslav Federation, which would be led by then-Prime Minister Josip Tito <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Close technical and economic agreements were signed, coordinating monetary systems and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Joint ventures were formed to exploit Albanian natural resources, with Albania supplying raw materials to Yugoslavia, which then produced industrial goods to sell back at inflated prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

However, this arrangement faced internal and external challenges. By June 1947, the Yugoslavs began publicly attacking Hoxha for his "anti-Marxist views," in a plan to replace him with his Minister of Interior, Koci Xoxe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Stalin reportedly told Milovan Djilas of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in early 1948 that they had no special interest in Albania and agreed that Yugoslavia should "swallow" it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. However, Yugoslavia's determination to acquire Albania, combined with moves in Greece, turned Stalin against Tito <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Stalin then sent letters publicly criticizing Tito's policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Hoxha seized this opportunity, and in a secret meeting in mid-April 1948, the Soviets guaranteed they would not allow a Yugoslav attack on Albania and granted Hoxha a free hand to purge pro-Yugoslav influence from the party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This intervention saved Hoxha's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. In November 1948, Koci Xoxe was stripped of his titles, arrested, and condemned to death in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

## Entering the Soviet Orbit

After 1948, Albania severed its ties with Yugoslavia and joined [[role_of_comecon_and_soviet_influence_on_bulgaria | COMECON]], entering the Soviet orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. From 1949 to 1951, all of Albania's trade was with COMECON states, with the Soviet Union alone accounting for half of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. The Soviets provided food and military aid, totaling about $200 million between 1948 and 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. They also transferred technologies and built several airfields, including a submarine base on Sazan island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. This base, completed in 1952, was a significant concern for the American Sixth Fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

Hoxha developed immense personal admiration for Stalin in his later years, even publishing a book about their meetings, where he depicted Stalin as warm and kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Hoxha was genuine in his fervor for a Stalinist economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This meant building a completely centrally-planned socialist economy, with all economic decisions laid out in 5-year plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Policy emphasized the collectivization of agriculture and the rapid build-up of heavy industry at the cost of consumer products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

## Breaking Up With the Soviets

Stalin's death in 1953 brought Nikita Khrushchev to power, whose new policies clashed with Hoxha's views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. Key disagreements included Khrushchev's repudiation of the Stalin cult of personality, his institution of collective leadership, his policy of "different paths to socialism," and especially his June 1956 reconciliation with Marshal Tito <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

As early as October 1954, Albania began gravitating towards China, another major Communist power at odds with Khrushchev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Hoxha met with Mao Zedong in September 1956, after which China started increasing its aid to Albania, reaching 21.6% of Albania's total trade balance in 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

As the [[sinosoviet_relations_and_treaty_of_friendship | Sino-Soviet Split]] widened, Albania's alliance with the Soviets became untenable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. The breaking point came in November 1960 when Hoxha publicly criticized Khrushchev in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. In February 1961, at the Albanian Communist Party congress, Hoxha launched an economic campaign against Soviet advice, pledging loyalty only on his own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. The Soviets, infuriated, withdrew their considerable aid in April 1961, which had made up 50% of Albania's economy from 1946 to 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

In October 1961, Khrushchev publicly called Hoxha an "unreconstructed Stalinist" at the Soviet Communist Party Congress in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. Khrushchev blamed the Albanians for spurning reconciliation attempts and accused Hoxha of sabotaging their relationship and wanting to maintain a cult of personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

In response, Hoxha delivered a fiery speech in November 1961, calling Khrushchev a "revisionist" and "defeatist" for his "peaceful coexistence" policy and de-Stalinization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. He famously declared:
> "The Albanian people and their Party of Labor will even live on grass if need be, but they will never sell themselves 'for 30 pieces of silver'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

The Soviet Union and its aligned states expelled Albania from the Warsaw Pact and COMECON, leaving China as their only significant ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. Khrushchev remarked, "It is true that we lost Albania, but what you've won is nothing much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

## Alliance with China

China attempted to replace Soviet aid to Albania, sending technicians and advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. The Chinese were less strict about loan interest and repayment, and their workers took the same salaries as average Albanians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. China, also isolated at the time, considered Albania one of its staunch allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. In November 1966, Mao Zedong called Albania "the only beacon of true socialism left in Europe" and pledged Chinese support against any attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

However, China was a developing country struggling with its own famines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. Geographical distance caused delays, with one instance taking a year and a half to deliver machinery for a textile plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. Chinese aid struggled to replace what was lost from the Soviets, making the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) one of the most challenging periods for [[communist_albanias_isolation_and_political_dynamics | Communist Albania]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

## Breaking Up With China

The alliance with China did not last long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. In 1969, China began its overtures to the West, which drove a wedge between it and Albania, as Albania valued its position as China's only "real" ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. The news of US President Nixon's trip to China in July 1971 was a "bombshell" for the Albanians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. China also quietly signaled that aid would not continue indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

Hoxha's Albania sent a formal message calling Nixon a "frenzied anti-Communist" and any meeting with him "revisionist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. In 1976, Hoxha purged high-ranking army and Party members for pro-Chinese leanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. After Mao's death that same year, the hated Tito was invited to Beijing for a meeting in 1977, which Albania considered an "embarrassing loss of face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. Albania intensified its rhetorical attacks on China, calling them collaborators no different from the Soviet Union or Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

In July 1978, China, under Deng Xiaoping, announced it would cut off all aid to Albania, which then constituted half of the country's economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

## Economic Isolation and Stagnation

Following the severing of ties with China, the Albanian government increasingly focused on [[communist_albanias_isolation_and_political_dynamics | self-reliance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. Hoxha declared Albania the only country left building socialism and revamped the Constitution in 1976 to enshrine the principle of self-reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. For the next 12 years, the country operated without foreign aid or credit, forbidding joint ventures with foreign companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. This period of extreme [[communist_albanias_isolation_and_political_dynamics | economic isolation]] led to deep and prolonged stagnation, with the average Albanian growing poorer throughout the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

## Conclusion

Albania's struggle for [[communist_albanias_isolation_and_political_dynamics | self-reliance]] in a globalized world demonstrates a unique trajectory. Despite being blessed with natural resources and a strategic position, the country repeatedly turned away from international engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Its pursuit of total economic "self-reliance" after sequential breaks with major Communist powers ultimately led to "anti-development and into madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>. After 1992, Albania underwent one of the fastest transitions to capitalism, though a profound need for economic reform still remains today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.

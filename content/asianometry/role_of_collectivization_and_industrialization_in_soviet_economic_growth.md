The Soviet Union's economic strategy for generations focused on rapid growth through specific policies, particularly **industrialization** and, to a lesser extent, collectivization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This approach allowed the country to grow faster than most other developing nations, with the exception of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.

## Industrialization: The Command Economy and Heavy Capital Investment

Following the devastation of [[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_soviet_economy | World War I]] and the [[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_soviet_economy | Russian Civil War]], the Bolshevik government initially attempted to establish a command economy but later introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. However, by 1928, Joseph Stalin discarded the NEP and launched the first Five-Year Plan, aiming to establish a command economy rooted in ideological goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

At this time, the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet economy]] was characterized by a shortage of capital (infrastructure, factories) but an abundance of labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. Stalin's defining strategy was heavy capital investment to build up this capital base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

These investments were directed towards "producer goods," which are items used to make other things, such as:
*   Machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>
*   Factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>
*   Power stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>
*   Railways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>
*   Other items of heavy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>

This created a feedback loop where the production of steel, electricity, and machinery was reinvested to produce even more of these goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. The investment rate surged from 8% in 1928 to 20% in the mid-1930s, making massive government investment a cornerstone of the country's economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

### Influence of Military and Labor Mobilization
A significant factor influencing the renewed push for a command economy was the Soviet Union's heavily militarized state and its distrust of Western nations, which led to the [[influence_of_military_and_heavy_industry_on_soviet_economic_policy | military's outsized influence]] on the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. This "permanent war economy" prioritized the production of tanks, guns, aircraft, and explosives, which were part of the heavy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. This focus also led to state secrecy around economic central planning, preventing open discussion, and siphoning resources from other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

The industrialization drive was also fueled by a demographic shift. Initially, there was substantial unemployment in the agricultural sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. By moving these unemployed individuals, and later women, into the industrial workforce, their productivity increased, contributing to economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. By 1973, women constituted 51% of the Soviet workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

### Outcomes and Challenges
From 1928 to 1970, gross national product (GNP) grew in excess of 5% annually, with capital accumulation being the most critical growth engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. However, not all investments were productive; some infrastructure built was wasteful and impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

By the [[soviet_economy_in_the_1960s | 1960s]], the engines driving this heavy industry growth model began to sputter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. Agricultural unemployment ended, and the mobilization of women into the workforce had largely peaked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>. Furthermore, Soviet industrial equipment was becoming outdated, with a growing percentage being over 10 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. This was partly due to plant managers avoiding work stoppages that risked production quotas and a lack of technologically advanced equipment made available to the civilian sector, as military advancements remained state secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

## Collectivization

A major event during the industrialization period was collectivization, which involved replacing individual peasant farms with collective ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. This policy led to peasants losing their land, grain, and livestock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. Those who resisted were exiled or executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

### Impact and Consequences
The collectivization drive resulted in devastating famines in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Siberia, costing millions of lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

Despite the immense human cost, the economic impact of collectivization on the overall [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union's economic outcomes]] is debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. It did contribute to the industrialization drive by spurring migration from the countryside to urban industrial centers, providing labor for factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. However, it is argued that collectivization more likely damaged other productive parts of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

Later, Soviet farms underperformed due to under-investment and poor management, with yields worse than other European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. The Soviet Union also had relatively little farmable land compared to countries like the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. Efforts to create new fertile farmlands, such as the draining of the Aral Sea to grow cotton, proved to be wasteful and led to an environmental disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.

The role and impact of collectivization remain controversial subjects among historians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

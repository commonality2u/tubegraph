Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) recently introduced their first generation of [[introduction_to_catls_sodiumion_battery | sodium-ion batteries]] for commercial use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While scientists initially developed sodium-ion batteries alongside [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]], lithium-ion technology eventually gained dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. However, interest in [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion batteries]] has seen a resurgence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Advantages of Sodium-ion Batteries
[[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | Sodium-ion batteries]] share a similar structure with [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]], including a cathode, anode, porous separator, and electrolyte, with the primary difference being the compounds used in their components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This similarity means that commercial [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion batteries]] can likely leverage the same engineering and production methods as [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The most significant advantage of [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion batteries]] lies in the [[raw_material_availability_and_costs_of_sodiumion_batteries | availability and cost of their raw materials]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Unlike lithium, which primarily comes from four countries (Australia, Chile, China, and Argentina) and is difficult and environmentally unfriendly to extract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, the global supply of sodium is virtually unlimited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The Earth's crust contains over 1,000 times more sodium than lithium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This abundance translates to a raw ingredient cost of $150 per ton for sodium, compared to lithium's $5,000 per tonâ€”a 30-fold decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Another benefit of [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion battery]] technologies is the "green field" for intellectual property rights, offering new companies more freedom compared to the extensive patents surrounding [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Recent Developments and Companies

Starting in the 2010s, [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion batteries]] began to be reconsidered for room-temperature applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Research publications on [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion batteries]] have increased rapidly, even surpassing those for [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Most research has focused on using "hard carbon" (charcoal) for anodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a> and sodium salts dissolved in organic carbonate solvents for electrolytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The cathode remains a key area of research, being the most expensive and crucial component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Sodium layered oxides, with their crystalline structure similar to lithium cobalt oxide, are promising cathode materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Key Players and Products
The first commercially ready [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion battery]] was an 18650 cell created by French research agency CNRS CEA in 2015, reporting an energy density of about 90 Wh/kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This research was spun off into Tiamat Energy in 2017, aiming to develop low-voltage systems for hybrid vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

In June 2020, Washington State University and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory announced a more advanced [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion battery]] potentially achieving 160 Wh/kg, comparable to current [[advantages_and_disadvantages_of_lfp_batteries | lithium-ion phosphate batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

Other companies commercializing [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion batteries]] include:
*   UK-based Faradion Limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>
*   Sweden-based Altris AB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>
*   China-based Hina Battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>
*   US-based Natron Energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>

### CATL's Approach
CATL's first-generation [[introduction_to_catls_sodiumion_battery | sodium-ion battery]] utilizes a hard carbon anode with a unique porous structure for improved cycle lifetime and ion movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. For the cathode, they have chosen Prussian white, an analog of Prussian blue pigment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Prussian white is inexpensive, easy to produce, non-toxic, and shows good discharge rates and capacity retention over many cycles (up to 95% after 10,000 cycles), although it is sensitive to moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

CATL's first-generation battery achieves energy densities of up to 160 Wh/kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, comparable to the Washington State battery and current [[advantages_and_disadvantages_of_lfp_batteries | lithium-ion phosphate batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Their second generation aims for over 200 Wh/kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

CATL plans to leverage its existing [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion battery]] infrastructure and product ecosystem due to similar engineering and manufacturing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. While this integration is advantageous, the cost savings for end-users are primarily from cheaper raw materials, with estimates suggesting a 10-30% price reduction compared to [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

CATL also highlights its battery system integration capabilities, allowing them to mix and match [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion]] and [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] in a single system, where the system prioritizes the higher energy density [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] when [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion]] falls short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Limitations and Future Applications

Despite recent advancements, [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion batteries]] have lower ionization potential than lithium, resulting in lower energy densities and operating voltages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. It is uncertain if they can ever match the top-line [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Therefore, [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion batteries]] are unlikely to replace [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion]] in applications like mobile phones and other compact electronic gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. However, they show strong potential in:
*   Short-range electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>
*   Stationary power systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>
*   Energy storage for solar and wind renewables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>

These applications can tolerate lower energy densities, and the significant cost savings make them highly attractive for large-scale operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. CATL, as the world's largest battery company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, is poised to invest substantial resources, leveraging its size, manufacturing prowess, and R&D capabilities to advance [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

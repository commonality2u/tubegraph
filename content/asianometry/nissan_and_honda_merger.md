In late December 2024, Nissan announced a plan to merge with Honda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This proposed merger is viewed more as a takeover or a "shotgun marriage" hastily arranged by the Japanese [[government_policies_and_the_automotive_industry | government]] to save Nissan, which is described as a "spiraling company left behind by the times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Nissan's historical performance has been volatile, but this latest downturn appears to be its final one as an independent entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Context for the Merger
Nissan has faced significant [[challenges_facing_nissan_in_the_automotive_industry | challenges facing Nissan in the automotive industry]] over the years, including the Global Financial Crisis, the 2011 earthquake, and rising R&D costs across the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The company engaged in "unhealthy growth" strategies, offering deep discounts, aggressive dealer incentives, and increased sales to rental fleets, which depreciated brand value and alienated dealers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Nissan also experienced missed opportunities with new products like the Nissan Titan pickup truck and the Nissan Leaf EV, due to lacking execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

The company's issues were compounded by the dramatic downfall of [[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Carlos Ghosn]] in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. His abrupt departure and the subsequent resignation of his successor, Hiroto Saikawa, due to financial irregularities, left Nissan in disarray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Post-[[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Ghosn]], Nissan cut jobs, closed factories, and reduced incentives, taking significant revenue losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. The company also worked to reset its unequal shareholding relationship with Renault, a process filled with internal conflict, culminating in a deal in 2023 that trimmed Renault's stake and granted Nissan more voting rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. These [[cultural_and_geopolitical_tensions_within_the_renaultnissan_alliance | cultural and geopolitical tensions within the RenaultNissan Alliance]] further complicated Nissan's path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

### Impact of the Chinese EV Market
A major wake-up call for Nissan's CEO, Makoto Uchida, was the rapid rise of Chinese EV companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. These companies develop and sell cars like consumer electronics, fueled by a powerful EV ecosystem and a massive domestic market that allows for economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. This has led to the old guard internal combustion engine joint ventures, like Dongfeng Nissan, struggling to keep up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. In 2023, Nissan's Chinese sales fell by approximately 30%, with similar declines projected for 2024, and factory utilization in China is reportedly at 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. China accounts for a third of Nissan's sales and is its top market, making the [[impact_of_the_chinese_ev_market_on_nissan | Impact of the Chinese EV Market on Nissan]] a critical factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

## The Trigger and Honda's Reluctance
The talks between Nissan and Honda were reportedly initiated after Taiwanese giant Foxconn began exploring opportunities to buy into Nissan or its trust banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Foxconn has been interested in the EV industry to help a client enter the U.S. and global markets, having previously engaged with Lordstown and Fisker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. Despite Foxconn's potential in EV manufacturing, their past performance, such as running [[mergers_and_acquisitions_involving_sharp | Sharp]], raised concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. Nissan is considered one of Japan Inc.'s "crown jewels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.

This interest from Foxconn likely prompted the abrupt tie-up with Honda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. However, Honda is not enthusiastic about dealing with Nissan's ongoing problems, which include an aging lineup and a lopsided cost situation where Japan accounts for less than 20% of car production but nearly half of the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. Famously, when asked at a press conference why Nissan would be a good business partner, Honda's CEO responded, "That's a difficult one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. Honda has reportedly set a condition for the merger to continue: Nissan must triple its profit by 2026, effectively placing the onus on Nissan to save itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. This condition raises a paradoxical question: if Nissan can achieve such a feat, why would it need to merge? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.

The entire situation is described as a "raging dumpster fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. While there is a decent chance the merger proceeds, the long-term outcome remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. Either way, the end of Nissan as an independent entity appears to be approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

For a long time, the silver-based photographic film industry was dominated by two companies: Eastman Kodak and Fujifilm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. For decades, these two companies clashed for dominance in their individual and global markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, these markets suddenly began to fall apart due to the advent of digital photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Digital photography, once thought to be 30 years away, arrived suddenly and annihilated the old silver-based film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Founding and Early Rivalry

Fujifilm was established in 1934 as a subsidiary of the Dai Nippon Celluloid Company, Japan's first manufacturer of cinematic film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. The company was founded after Dai Nippon approached Kodak's founder, George Eastman, to build a photographic film factory in Japan, but Kodak's engineers declined, deeming the climate too humid for high-quality film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. With financial backing from the Japanese government, Dai Nippon started Fuji Photo Film, establishing its first factory at the foot of Mount Fuji in Minami-Ashigara City, Kanagawa, in need of high-quality water and air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

Unlike its competitors, Fujifilm chose to produce its photographic film internally rather than importing it, hiring a German emulsion specialist for technical expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This commitment to developing its own technology, despite the initial difficulties, became a core part of its culture and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Fujifilm was known for investing more in research and development than its peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

The development of color photography film was a significant challenge for the industry. Creating a colorized image required precisely mixing three primary printing colors: cyan, magenta, and yellow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Color photographic film consisted of about 20 overlapping, evenly coated layers of functional particles, approximately 20 micrometers thick, demanding near [[japanese_dominance_and_decline_in_lithography | semiconductor]] quality control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

Fujifilm completed its color film product in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. This, along with popular products like amateur roll film (1952) and black and white roll film (1958), helped set the company apart from approximately 30 domestic competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

### Intensifying Competition

Around the time Fujifilm was solidifying its domestic position, Japan reopened its markets to foreign competitors, including Kodak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. The [[historical_rivalry_and_competition_between_fujifilm_and_kodak | rivalry between Kodak and Fujifilm]] became legendary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. In 1963, Fujifilm's revenue was about $75 million, while Kodak's was $1.1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Kodak boasted a globally recognized brand and vast resources, even owning a silver mine and cattle ranch for film production materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

Despite enjoying preferential domestic market treatment (import quota until 1968, then a tariff) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>, Japanese consumers initially perceived Kodak as a superior brand and Fujifilm as lower quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. However, Fujifilm steadily narrowed the technical gap, with its films outperforming Kodak's in certain technical areas by 1970, such as requiring less light for color images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

Fujifilm leveraged this technical proficiency to maintain its niche in the Japanese high-end prosumer and professional photography sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. A key strategy was the rollout of a mini-lab retail push, allowing third parties to offer speedy one-hour development, creating a powerful network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. By 1994, Japan had 13,400 mini-labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Kodak's Japanese market entry strategy also inadvertently helped Fujifilm, as Kodak outsourced marketing to a firm that primarily cut prices, positioning Kodak at the low end of the market in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

Fujifilm began selling under its own brand in the United States in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. While unable to penetrate the drugstore market loyal to Kodak, it found success in American supermarkets and later in niche movie and professional photographer segments, emphasizing technical quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. Sponsorships of major sporting leagues like the NBA and the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, along with an Academy Award for technical merit in 1982 for its A250 Motion Picture film, solidified Fujifilm's reputation for superior quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

By 1995, Fujifilm held a 13% market share in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. This rising success led to political issues, including a 1993 lawsuit from Kodak for dumping, which Kodak lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Fujifilm established a color film paper lab in South Carolina to address concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. A July 1995 petition from Kodak alleged that Fujifilm colluded with the Japanese government to exclude Kodak products from the Japanese market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. At the time, Fujifilm held 70% market share in Japan, while Kodak had less than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Fujifilm vigorously defended itself, and the World Trade Organization rejected the lawsuit in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

## The Digital Transition

Both Kodak and Fujifilm had long recognized that digital imaging was the future, developing many digital imaging technologies themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. As early as 1975, a Kodak employee, Steve Sasson, produced the first digital camera, combining Fairchild CCD chips, a Motorola analog-to-digital converter, and a Kodak lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. This early prototype, weighing 8 pounds and the size of a toaster, produced poor imagery, but Kodak employees foresaw a future where silver-based imaging products would be obsolete by the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. Kodak scientists also produced high-quality image sensors, including a 1.4 million pixel CCD sensor in 1986, though it failed to gain market traction due to high prices and lack of peripheral devices like PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.

Kodak's explorations into digital photography often resulted in patents but not new, successful businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. The company struggled to settle on a plan for the digital era, hesitant to pursue ventures that didn't align with its established, highly profitable traditional film business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. For example, Kodak had a printer with a microprocessor, the Ektaprint, in 1976, which was simpler and more reliable than Xerox's rival, but Kodak failed to aggressively pursue the market due to unfamiliarity with the heavy equipment rental business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

Fujifilm, by contrast, had a more diversified business, which gave them early warnings of the impending digital transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. In 1981, Fujifilm released a product for diagnostic x-ray imaging that replaced x-ray film with a photosensitive plate, leading to the Fuji Computed Radiography product in 1983, still in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. The digitization of plate making for publications also highlighted the potential for film to become obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. Shigataka Komori, a sales manager in that division, began to worry about a future without film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

Fujifilm recognized that image digitization would negate years of hard work and specialized technologies developed for photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. In 1980, under new president Minoru Onishi, Fujifilm introduced a three-pronged strategy:
1.  **Pioneer Digital Imaging:** Develop original digital imaging technologies, similar to Kodak's early efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. Fujifilm developed its own imaging sensors and released its first digital camera, the Fujifilm DS-1P, in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.
2.  **Milk the Analog Cash Cow:** Improve the quality of film images to prolong the life of the analog business and widen the quality gap with digital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.
3.  **Build New Business Lines:** Develop new ventures outside of digital photography and analog photographic film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

In the mid-1980s, Fujifilm invested in various [[key_differences_in_strategies_between_fujifilm_and_kodak_during_digital_transition | diversifications]], some peripheral to photography (like inkjet and optical disk), and others based on core photographic film manufacturing technologies, such as cancer pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

However, the continued success of the core film business posed a challenge. In the 1980s, Fujifilm surpassed Kodak in technology and released popular products like the 1986 Fujifilm QuickSnap, one of the first modern disposable cameras, which was highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. The thriving Japanese economy and high film sales contributed to Fujifilm generating over $600 million USD in operating profits in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>. This success interfered with diversification efforts, leading to rationalizations that digital wouldn't be as good or wouldn't take over for at least 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.

### The Inevitable Decline

In 1995, Casio released the QV-10 digital camera, which became the first commercially successful consumer digital camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. Priced at $833, its image quality was inferior to film, and battery life was poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>. However, it featured a 1.8-inch color LCD screen, allowing users to view pictures immediately without development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.

Despite other electronics companies like Sony following suit, early CCD-based digital cameras struggled due to subpar imaging quality, slow shutter speeds, poor battery life, and high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. Photographic film and camera sales held out against these initial digital offerings and even reached their highest level in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>.

However, global demand for color film began declining rapidly at 20-30% per year starting in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. This was largely due to the widespread proliferation of the CMOS image sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>. While CCDs were specialty chips requiring expensive and power-hungry peripherals, CMOS image sensors, being silicon [[japanese_dominance_and_decline_in_lithography | semiconductors]], could leverage existing fabrication knowledge to be mass-produced cheaply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. By the mid-1990s, process nodes were sophisticated enough for higher-quality active pixel CMOS image sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>. The crucial turning point came in 1999 when mobile phones began integrating these sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>. CMOS image sensors became history's fastest-ramping [[japanese_dominance_and_decline_in_lithography | semiconductor]] product, marking the beginning of the end for the silver-based film camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>.

## Fujifilm's Transformation and Kodak's Struggle

In 2004, with its core business imploding, Fujifilm's CEO, Shigataka Komori, announced "Vision 75," a medium-term plan named for the company's 75th anniversary in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. This plan aimed to guide the company beyond its roots towards new success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>.

Vision 75 had three steps:
1.  **Strategic Reforms:** Fujifilm, employing around 15,000 people in large photography film factories globally, faced expensive infrastructure that the shrinking business could no longer afford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. Starting in 2006, Fujifilm spent $1.8 billion cutting jobs, closing factories, and canceling sales partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>. Unlike its competitor Konica, which exited the photography business entirely, Komori committed to preserving the culture of photography, stating it was not a question of making or losing money, and Fujifilm still produces film today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>.
2.  **New Profitable Growth Businesses:** Fujifilm recognized that digital cameras, despite their presence in the market, were a "terrible business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>. The real profit had always been in selling film, which once provided 60% of Fuji's sales and two-thirds of its profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. This led Fujifilm to transition into entirely new markets, many growing from its film technology base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Fujitac:** Color film's multi-layered structure led to the development of triacetyl cellulose (TAC) celluloids in the 1950s for film bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>. TAC's transparency and smooth surface found applications in various industries, notably as a protective covering for polarizing layers in LCD screens by the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a>. By the 2000s, Fujitac became a billion-dollar business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>.
    *   **Priority Businesses:** Inspired by Fujitac, Fujifilm identified six priority businesses:
        *   Digital Imaging (high-end digital cameras) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>
        *   Optical devices (Fujinon lenses for broadcast, security cameras) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>
        *   Specialty Chemicals/Materials (serving solar panel, touch panel, [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductor]] industries, including photoresists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>
        *   Graphics (digital printing, inkjet technology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>
        *   Documents/Printers/Office Copier Solutions (primarily through the Fuji Xerox joint venture, which became Fujifilm Business Innovation and the company's largest business line by 2021, accounting for 30% of revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>
        *   Healthcare Business (ultimate expression of commitment to survival) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>
    *   **Healthcare Diversification:** Building on its x-ray film products and medical imaging systems (endoscopes, ultrasonic devices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[18:23:00]</a>, Fujifilm significantly increased patent applications for pharmaceutical products and medical care equipment from 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>. It began producing skincare cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>. This seemingly random diversification had significant crossover with photography film production expertise in emulsions, oxidation, and collagen (a major ingredient in gelatin for film) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:58:00">[18:58:00]</a>. Fujifilm augmented its R&D with acquisitions, including Toyama Chemical in 2008 for nearly $1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>.

For its 2008 fiscal year, Fujifilm reported its highest sales in history, 2.8 trillion yen (approximately $27 billion USD), a 100% increase from 1.4 trillion yen in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:00">[19:36:00]</a>. Imaging products, like digital cameras, shrunk from 54% of revenues to just 19% by 2008, showcasing Fujifilm's diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>. Although hit by the global financial crisis and strengthening Japanese Yen, Fujifilm has largely maintained annual revenues around $20 billion since 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>.

### Kodak's Downfall

Meanwhile, Kodak's fate was far different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>. From 2005 to 2010, Kodak's sales declined from $11 billion to $5.9 billion, while Fujifilm's sales grew nearly 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a>.

Kodak did undertake some similar initial steps to Fujifilm, such as shrinking its film manufacturing business in 1999, cutting $1.2 billion in costs and 20,000 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a>. However, it "could never move beyond the idea of selling film and providing photography services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>. While former CEO Colby Chandler attempted [[challenges_and_failures_in_kodaks_diversification_attempts | diversifying]] into floppy disks, batteries, artificial snow, and pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>, his successors reversed this drive, doubling down on imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>.

Notably, in 1993, Kodak spun off its specialty chemical business (formed in 1920), which derived only 8% of its sales from Kodak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>. Today, Eastman Chemical is a $10 billion Fortune 500 company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>. Kodak also sold its Sterling Winthrop drug unit, including its over-the-counter consumer drugs business (like Bayer Aspirin), which generated over $1 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>. Although Kodak had begun researching and filing pharmaceutical and medical equipment patents around the same time as Fujifilm, it withdrew from these ventures in 1996 to focus solely on photography, branding itself an "imaging company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>.

Kodak attempted to develop new digital technologies for customer imaging needs, releasing the EasyShare digital camera in 2001, which sold well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>. Kodak held leading market share in the U.S. digital camera space in 2004-2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a>. However, like Fujifilm, Kodak learned that digital cameras were a "terrible business" as other companies entered the market, causing Kodak's share to shrivel to 7% by 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>. Kodak ultimately made more money from licensing its digital technology patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>.

In 2005, Kodak entered the inkjet printer business, competing with giants like Hewlett-Packard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>. This venture resulted in net losses of $1.2 billion in 2005 and $691 million in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>. In 2007, the company sold its last valuable asset, its Healthcare division (including radiology and medical printing products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:05:00">[23:05:00]</a>. Saddled with high debt and pension liabilities, Kodak filed for bankruptcy five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:14:00">[23:14:00]</a>.

### Core Differences

The fundamental difference between the two companies was their identity: Kodak was a consumer brand with a strong technology base, while Fujifilm began as a technology company that happened to sell to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>. When its consumer businesses disappeared, Fujifilm found it easier to return to its technological roots and diversify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. Both companies excelled in chemistry and manufacturing precision chemicals, but neither had expertise in producing [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductors]] or electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:46:00">[23:46:00]</a>. Fujifilm recognized this and leveraged its chemical expertise to diversify, retaining "film" in its name as a nod to its origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:56:00">[23:56:00]</a>. Kodak, however, remained stuck on its sinking ship, throwing away potential life rafts, and ultimately went down with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>.

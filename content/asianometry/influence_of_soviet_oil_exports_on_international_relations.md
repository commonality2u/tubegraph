In 1979, the Soviet Union was the world's leading oil producer, pumping 11.5 million barrels daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The country finished the [[soviet_oil_production_in_the_1960s | 1960s]] as the second-biggest oil-producing nation globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This period saw the [[soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union become an energy superpower]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, a development that ultimately contributed to its dissolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Rise of West Siberian Oil

The country's most plentiful oil and natural gas bounties were located beneath Siberia's frozen swamps and lakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The West Siberian Basin, located 600 miles east of the Ural Mountains, is a vast, flat area covering 3.4 million square kilometers, nearly five times the size of Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. About a third of this area, nearly one million square kilometers, is potentially oil-bearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This region's conditions are harsh and remote, with short summers and long, severe winters, and 60-70% of the area consisting of swamps and lakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Despite predictions by Soviet geologists in the 1930s about significant deposits in the West Siberian Basin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, the Soviet government initially hesitated to explore and develop these fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. However, the rapid decline of the Volga-Ural oil fields starting in the mid to late [[soviet_oil_production_in_the_1960s | 1960s]] forced a change in policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The Volga-Ural fields declined by 261 million tons between 1971 and 1975, much faster than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

Soviet oil production had critical functions: it was the country's largest source of foreign currency (over 50%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, used for purchasing goods like wheat from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, and the Soviets had long-term oil export obligations to the Eastern Bloc countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

In January 1968, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin visited the Tyumen region, highlighting its potential for advancing the Soviet economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. By 1971, Brezhnev urgently pushed for the development of West Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. A new ministry was established, led by Boris Shcherbina, to build oil infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Developing West Siberia required creating entire towns and bringing in hundreds of thousands of workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Worker settlements were difficult to build due to harsh conditions and the need to transport all food via rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

West Siberia rapidly began yielding vast riches:
*   **1965:** 5.6 million tons of oil, 1.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
*   **1970:** 31 million tons of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>
*   **1975:** 141 million tons of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>
*   **1977:** 211 million tons of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>

By 1973, 113 oil fields had been discovered, including supergiant fields like Samotlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The Soviets built long gas pipelines, such as the Druzhba (Friendship) and Bratstvo (Brotherhood) pipelines, to transport products to buyers in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Pipeline construction rates were three to five times faster than in the West, costing a third of Western averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, partly due to disregard for environmental impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## International Energy Deals with Western Europe

West Siberia's oil dominance found customers at an opportune time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. International conflicts in the 1950s and 1960s demonstrated to Europe the risks of relying solely on Arab oil, making Soviet oil a compelling diversification option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

The first Western European country to strike an oil deal with the Soviets was Austria in 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Italy followed in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, West Germany in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, and France in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. West Germany was a particularly notable agreement, despite domestic controversy, due to its declining coal mines and skyrocketing domestic gas demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. The decision was made with the condition that Soviet share stayed under 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The year after West Germany started accepting Soviet gas, the Four Power Agreement of 1971 was signed, leading to de facto recognition between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. These agreements facilitated more economic partnerships with Western countries as part of d√©tente throughout the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

The oil crises of the 1970s, including the Iranian Revolution, further accelerated these economic exchanges between the Soviets and Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Despite the Soviet's reputation as an erratic trade partner, many of these energy relationships persist today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

## Failed US-Soviet Energy Deal: The "North Star" Project

In 1972, the U.S. and the Soviet Union agreed on a potential energy deal known as "North Star," which proposed liquefying Soviet natural gas and shipping it to the American West Coast from 1980 to 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This deal, if realized, would have involved Japan and provided significant LNG revenues and Western technologies to the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. However, the U.S. Congress ultimately denied the Soviets' requests for most-favored-nation status and credit guarantees, leading to the deal being called off entirely in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Impact on the Eastern Bloc

Soviet oil and energy exports were crucial for holding the Eastern Bloc together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. After World War II, the Soviet Union established the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) for Eastern Bloc states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Within CMEA, trade was largely inter-bloc, with the Soviets providing raw goods and satellites sending back manufactured goods, machinery, and agricultural produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

Oil deliveries to these countries were made on "brotherly terms" at prices far lower than the Western market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. The Soviet Union could not pass on increased extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. By the mid-1960s, these inter-bloc trade agreements were known to be unfavorable to the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. As the Soviets developed their lucrative Western European energy export industry in the 1970s, the opportunity costs of these "friendship oil" trade agreements became increasingly clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Nevertheless, states like East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary had become dependent on these brotherly oil imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Failure to meet these obligations had significant political and socio-economic repercussions, especially as the satellites became increasingly indebted to Western creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

## Decline and Dissolution

Expectations for West Siberia's energy output were that it would grow indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. However, production stalled and gave out almost as quickly as it grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. From 1975, West Siberia's oil production growth rates rapidly declined, from 23.8% in 1976 to 7% in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. The Soviet oil juggernaut was sputtering, with total oil growth falling to under one percent by 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Without access to more advanced oil drills and pumps from the West, the Soviets felt compelled to drill more exploratory wells further out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. The country doubled its drilling efforts, from 13 million meters drilled in 1977 to over 26 million in 1984, with 16 million meters of new drilling in West Siberia alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This intensive drilling led to higher costs, doubling drill costs per meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Despite these efforts, Soviet oil output fell into negative growth in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This meant the Soviet energy industry, and the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet economy as a whole]], had to invest more to produce less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

The [[economic_impact_of_oil_production_on_the_soviet_economy | Soviet economy]] became more energy-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. In the Soviet Union, nearly half of oil consumption came from heavy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, which lacked the flexibility to adjust usage compared to Western consumer-driven economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Coupled with considerable oil export obligations, the Soviets had little room to cut consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

By the late 1980s, the Soviet Union was still the world's largest oil producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, but its economy had stagnated, consumed by its unproductive energy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Coherence within the Eastern Bloc faded as the Soviets prioritized their own needs, leading satellite states to increasingly turn to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

Then, in 1986, oil prices collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Increased output from Alaska, the British North Sea, and OPEC (particularly Saudi Arabia drastically raising quotas in September 1985) contributed to an oil glut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Oil prices plummeted from $27 a barrel to below $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. All the Soviet investment in oil suddenly started incurring losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Foreign currency earnings from oil and gas sales evaporated, paving the way for the debt crisis that dissolved the Soviet Union a few years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

## Legacy

The high energy revenues from oil exports papered over the need for much-needed reforms in the Soviet economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. For example, there was no need to improve domestic agriculture if oil money paid for imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>, nor to develop domestic computing if Western computers could be bought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Energy served as a pillar that kept the Soviet house standing for longer than it should have, but also acted as a crutch that weakened the country's ability to stand independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. The legacy of the [[soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet energy superpower]] and its influence on European and Asian politics continues to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

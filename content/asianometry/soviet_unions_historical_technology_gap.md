The [[Soviet computer development history | Soviet Union]] has long suffered from a significant technology gap with the United States in computers and advanced electronics, a disparity that dates back to as early as the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The reasons for this gap are rooted in ideology, technology, and geopolitics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

At the time of the [[Soviet Unions attempt to abolish money | Soviet collapse]] in 1991, the country painfully lacked sufficiently powerful integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The combined computing power of all computers in the [[Soviet Union as an energy superpower | country]] would still be two generations behind a single American Cray supercomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Post-Soviet Challenges
The collapse of the [[Soviet Union as an energy superpower | Soviet Union]] separated its scientific and industrial complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Russia was left with 96% of the vacuum electronics production facilities, while the more advanced semiconductor production facilities were located in East Germany, Belarus, and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Russian industrial policy after the collapse exacerbated this issue by shifting away from domestic electronics, leading to increased dependence on imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Today, Russia remains a net importer of integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Modern Day Gap in Semiconductor Manufacturing
Despite efforts to develop homegrown chips, particularly after threatened sanctions in 2014, Russia's domestic manufacturing capacity for semiconductors has continued to fall behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Notable Russian manufacturers and their technological capabilities include:

*   **JSC Micron Group**: Russia's largest domestic semiconductor manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
    *   Its roots date back to 1964, when it was the first in the [[Soviet Union as an energy superpower | country]] to produce an integrated circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
    *   In 2010, Micron acquired technology for a 90 nanometer process node from STMicroelectronics, which launched in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This meant Russia was approximately nine years behind the leading edge at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
    *   An announcement in 2014 about achieving a 65 nanometer node was premature, as commercial viability requires imported lithography scanners from the West or Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The company's 65 nanometer line remains "under development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This expanded the gap with the leading edge from 9 years to 15+ years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
    *   A plan in 2016 to expand production and achieve a 28 nanometer capable factory by 2018 appears not to have materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

*   **Angstrom**: Another leading microelectronics fab in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
    *   Founded in 1963, Angstrom developed the Elektronika NTS-8010, the [[Soviet computer development history | Soviet Union's first completely domestic computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
    *   Currently, Angstrom offers 130 nanometer and 90 nanometer process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
    *   Despite borrowing nearly a billion dollars in 2008 to purchase chip-making equipment from AMD to produce 90 nanometer chips by 2010 and upgrade to 65 nanometer, production didn't start until 2016, and the 65 nanometer process is still unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

*   **Citronix**: Applied for a subsidy in 2007 to develop a 65 and 45 nanometer chip manufacturing fab, but the project's capital intensity seems to have prevented it from moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## Dependence on Foreign Fabs for Advanced Designs
More sophisticated Russian semiconductor design ventures, such as the Elbrus microprocessors by the Moscow Center of Spark Technologies and Baikal CPUs by Baikal Electronics, have had to rely on foreign foundries due to lagging domestic capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

*   The Elbrus 2SM, declared the first completely Russian microprocessor in 2014, was initially fabricated using a TSMC 90 nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   Baikal Electronics' latest offering, the Baikal-M series, is an eight-core system-on-chip fabricated on a TSMC 28 nanometer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Current Impact of Sanctions
In late February 2022, Taiwan's Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) halted shipments to Russia due to sanctions, affecting companies like Baikal, MCST, Yadro, and STC Module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Intel and AMD also stopped their shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Given the domestic industry's limitations, it is doubtful that the Russian semiconductor manufacturing industry will advance past 65 nanometers in the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. While Russia has stockpiles and contingency plans, and military equipment doesn't require the latest chips, these sanctions will further hinder the digitization and modernization of Russian industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. For example, Russia has 23 times fewer industrial robots per 10,000 employees than the world average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

The [[Impact of bureaucratic infighting on Soviet technological advancements | inability]] of the [[Soviet Unions attempt to abolish money | Soviet communist party]] to close the widening technology gap with the West contributed to a broad loss of confidence in its competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

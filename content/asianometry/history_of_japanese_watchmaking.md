When Japan opened its borders around 1860, the global watch market was largely dominated by the United States and [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Switzerland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Despite efforts by the Swiss to protect their manufacturing secrets, this knowledge eventually reached Japan, enabling it to become a major watch producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Early Modernization and Clock Production

Japan rapidly adopted Western technologies, including those for railroads, telegraphs, and military applications, as part of a broader government goal for modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. When Western watches were first imported into Japan in the 1860s, they were considered luxury goods for the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. In 1868, Japan imported 1,185 wall clocks and only 300 pocket watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. By 1887, this increased significantly, with over 700,000 clocks imported, installed in hospitals, schools, town halls, and post offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

During this period, Japan sought to reduce its reliance on clock imports from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. As clocks were technologically simpler than watches, Japan's early industry focused on replicating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

*   **Hayashi Shii**: In 1888, timepiece retailer Hayashi Shii opened Japan's first modern clock factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This factory was successful, leading Hayashi to open five more factories in Osaka, Tokyo, and other locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Growth**: Japan's clock industry quickly developed competence in manufacturing, with production rising from 37,466 pieces in 1905 to 1.2 million in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. By the eve of World War I, there were over 20 clock factories in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Exports**: Initially driven by domestic and military demand, Hayashi began exporting excess production to Far Eastern cities like Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Bombay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. By the 1930s, Japan was a significant clock exporter, holding 35% of the total market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Rise of Japanese Watchmaking Companies

As pocket watches gained popularity, Japanese companies began to manufacture them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The percentage of Japanese regularly wearing watches grew from 0.8% in 1887 to 4.2% in 1897, and then to 10% in 1907 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Hattori & Co. (Seiko)

Hattori & Co., founded by Hattori Kintaro, became the largest Japanese watch company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

*   **Early Career**: Kintaro Hattori learned the watch industry at age 13 in a Tokyo clock dealership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. At 17, in 1877, he opened his own shop repairing and reselling watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. In 1881, he married into a watch trading family, purchased a shop from his father-in-law, and began selling imported [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] and American watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. He sourced products by meeting [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] trading houses in Yokohama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing**: Recognizing the opportunity during the Japanese clock boom, Hattori opened his own factory in 1895, producing wall clocks and later high-end grandfather clocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. He named this factory Seikosha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Challenges**: Early Japanese watches struggled to compete with [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] and American companies in terms of thinness, accuracy, and reliability, and were often more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Sales volumes were insufficient to achieve economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### [[japanese_market_strategies_in_the_watch_industry | Japanese Market Strategies]]

Japanese watchmaking benefited significantly from government intervention.

*   **Tariff Protection**: Western imports had entered Japan freely due to an unequal treaty signed in the mid-1800s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. However, this treaty lapsed in 1899, allowing Japan to regain control over its trade relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The Japanese government immediately implemented an import substitution policy, raising tariffs to protect domestic manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Tariffs on silver and nickel watch imports, which were 5% before 1899, rose to 25% and then to 40% by 1906 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Similar actions were taken for bicycles, machine tools, hydroelectric turbines, and automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Hattori's Success**: Protected from Western imports, Hattori's watchmaking business flourished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. From 1906 to 1930, his company captured 48% of the domestic clock market and 85% of the watch market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Improvements**: Hattori's company improved manufacturing by focusing on automating a small number of select [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]]-inspired models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Of the 25 watch types released between 1895 and 1937, only three sold well: the 1909 Empire pocket watch and two wristwatches, the Laurel and the Seiko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. To gain expertise, Hattori hired engineers from Tokyo universities to disassemble and reassemble [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Shablon Practice**: Hattori also sourced raw watch parts from [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Switzerland]], which were not subject to tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. From 1915 to 1935, [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Switzerland]] supplied 69% of Japan's watch parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This practice of importing disassembled watch movement sets (known as "shablon") and assembling them within Japan was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Japanese imports of watch movements surged from 22,500 between 1895-1899 to 122,000 in 1900 (the first year of finished watch tariffs), and 250,000 by 1905 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Citizen Watch Company

The [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss watch industry]] grew concerned that the "shablon" practice would lead to their long-term downfall by transferring critical watchmaking expertise abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

*   **Rudolph Schmidt**: In 1894, [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] citizen Rudolph Schmidt established a trading company in Yokohama, initially importing and selling complete watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. After Japan raised tariffs in 1908, he began importing "shablon" into Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Schmidt's Yokohama workshop finished watches with cases imported from his family's [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] watch case factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Full Production in Japan**: By 1910, Schmidt shifted the entire watch production process, including case making, to Japan, which alarmed the [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss watch industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. In 1912, he moved his factory to Tokyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Formation of Citizen**: In 1930, Schmidt acquired a watchmaking workshop named Shosha, which he renamed to the Citizen Watch Company, a name he had owned since 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Citizen would become the second major Japanese watchmaker after Hattori & Co. (Seiko) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

By 1935, Hattori's watch factory became the single largest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Both Hattori and Citizen began expanding internationally, promoting their watches as "Japanese made" and highlighting the "extraordinary aptitude" of Japanese workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] Response and World War II

With watch exports declining in the 1920s, the [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] reorganized their industry into a cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Part suppliers signed "watchmaking conventions" to only do business with each other, and a holding company, ASUAG, was set up to acquire movement manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. By 1934, the [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] government controlled watchmaking activities and monitored all exports of watch parts and machine tools, making "shablon" illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This largely helped the [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss watch industry]] maintain high profits and a consistent 50% global market share for several decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

The 1930s also saw a market shift from pocket watches to wristwatches, which gained new features like self-winding movements, calendars, and waterproof cases, all while becoming smaller and more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. During World War II, most watch companies, except for the [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]], halted production and diverted resources to the war effort, often producing precision tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Switzerland]]'s neutrality gave them an advantage in the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

After the war, American watch companies struggled against cheap [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] imports, leading to a long-term decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Hattori & Co. worked to overcome the postwar slump and compete with the [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] by copying [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] machine tools, studying their methods, and exploiting loopholes in the cartel system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. By 1966, Hattori was producing [[comparison_of_mechanical_and_quartz_watches | mechanical watches]] that matched [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] performance, establishing themselves as world leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## The [[impact_of_quartz_technology_on_the_watch_industry | Quartz Revolution]]

Even as [[japanese_market_strategies_in_the_watch_industry | Japanese mechanical watches]] matched [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>, Seiko (formerly Hattori) aimed to introduce a new type of watch that would revolutionize the [[comparison_of_mechanical_and_quartz_watches | mechanical watch]] world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

*   **Quartz Principles**: The technology behind [[impact_of_quartz_technology_on_the_watch_industry | quartz watches]] had existed for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. In the 1880s, Pierre Curie discovered that applying pressure or alternating current to a quartz crystal causes it to vibrate consistently, at about 33,000 times a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This property could create timepieces far more accurate than any [[comparison_of_mechanical_and_quartz_watches | mechanical clock]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. In 1927, a Bell Labs engineer created a room-sized, high-precision [[impact_of_quartz_technology_on_the_watch_industry | quartz clock]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **Bulova Accutron**: In 1960, Bulova, a prominent American watchmaker, released the first commercial electronic watch, the Accutron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. It used a 360 Hz tuning fork, making it 10 times more accurate than a [[comparison_of_mechanical_and_quartz_watches | mechanical watch]] with fewer discrete parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Developed by [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] scientist Max Hetzel, this technology initially found no interest in [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Switzerland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Bulova's adherence to tuning fork technology, despite [[impact_of_quartz_technology_on_the_watch_industry | quartz]] becoming the clear future, led to its acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. However, the Accutron spurred a wave of technological development in electronic watches across the US, Japan, and [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Switzerland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Seiko Astron**: In 1959, Hattori (now Seiko) formed a team to commercialize [[impact_of_quartz_technology_on_the_watch_industry | quartz timekeepers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. The commercialization of transistors allowed for small circuits to power [[impact_of_quartz_technology_on_the_watch_industry | quartz crystals]], measure oscillations, and translate them into second pulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Their initial goal was a portable [[impact_of_quartz_technology_on_the_watch_industry | quartz chronometer]] for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. After successfully shipping this chronometer, they worked on miniaturizing the technology into a wristwatch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. The resulting watch, the Seiko Astron SQ, was a complex mix of components, featuring a hand-soldered hybrid circuit with 76 transistors, 29 condensers, and 84 resistors, as advanced integrated circuits were not yet widely available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. Seiko outsourced some CMOS production to the American firm Interel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   **Market Launch**: The Seiko Astron SQ went on sale in Tokyo on Christmas Day 1969 for the equivalent of $31,000 today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Seiko marketed the Astron with the tagline, "Someday all watches will be made this way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. While revolutionary, sales were initially slow, with only 3,000 Astron digital watches sold by 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.
*   **LED and LCD Watches**: Hamilton Watch in Pennsylvania developed its own [[impact_of_quartz_technology_on_the_watch_industry | quartz watch]] using light-emitting diodes (LEDs), displaying time and date without hands or a dial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. They called their Pulsar a "wrist computer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Initially a luxury item, it gained popularity after being worn by James Bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. By the mid-1970s, LED [[impact_of_quartz_technology_on_the_watch_industry | quartz watches]] became the market standard, with 650,000 sold globally in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. LED watches eventually gave way to LCD watches due to better battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. Integrated circuit firms and traditional watch companies rushed into the digital [[impact_of_quartz_technology_on_the_watch_industry | quartz watch]] category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, with companies like Texas Instruments and even Intel entering the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Casio, originally a [[the_history_of_japans_computer_and_software_industry | calculator company]], entered the low-end market, competing with Timex by offering affordable models in drug stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

## Peak and Stagnation

[[japanese_market_strategies_in_the_watch_industry | Japanese watch exports]] to the United States, a crucial market for the [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]], exploded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. Export value grew nearly tenfold, reaching $26 million in 1975, with watches accounting for almost 20% of total Japanese exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Meanwhile, [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss exports]] stagnated, and their market share plummeted from 83% in the early 1970s to just 20% by 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. By 1985, [[japanese_market_strategies_in_the_watch_industry | Japanese watch exports]] to the US totaled $373 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. Seiko, Citizen, and Casio effectively pushed the [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] out of their most valuable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

The [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss watch industry]] struggled to adapt to the shift to [[impact_of_quartz_technology_on_the_watch_industry | quartz]], despite being aware of the technology and even demoing their own prototypes in 1967, two years before the Astron's release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. Their pride in their [[comparison_of_mechanical_and_quartz_watches | mechanical heritage]] and their decentralized industry structure, comprising many small firms, hindered their ability to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. [[impact_of_quartz_technology_on_the_watch_industry | Quartz watches]], made with modern semiconductor production methods, offered titanic scale that overwhelmed the painstaking human training required for [[comparison_of_mechanical_and_quartz_watches | mechanical watches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

The [[impact_of_quartz_technology_on_the_watch_industry | quartz revolution]] ended the [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] grip on the global watch industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. Their 40% global market share in 1974 shrank to just 10% a decade later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. By 1983, over half of [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Switzerland's]] watchmakers had gone bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. While the [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss]] eventually shifted to [[impact_of_quartz_technology_on_the_watch_industry | quartz technologies]] out of necessity, their [[comparison_of_mechanical_and_quartz_watches | mechanical watch]] industry has since made a comeback by restructuring into groups like the Swatch Group and focusing on luxury brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

The [[japanese_market_strategies_in_the_watch_industry | Japanese watch industry]], however, peaked in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. It faced new challenges from industrial competitors in Hong Kong and China, leading to stagnation and relocation of manufacturing abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. The industry has since struggled to return to its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

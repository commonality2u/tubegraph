Iran faces significant [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources | water management]] challenges, exacerbated by its naturally arid climate and low rainfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Historically, the country relied on sophisticated water systems like the qanat, an underground tunnel system that brought snowmelt from mountains to plains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. However, modern approaches, particularly the extensive use of groundwater, have led to severe and long-term consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Shift to Groundwater Extraction

After World War I, and particularly during the White Revolution land reforms in the 1960s, Iran's water needs grew beyond the capacity of qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The government encouraged the use of modern hydraulic projects like dams and wells, with the first modern water well built in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Drilling for groundwater with electrically powered pumps was significantly quicker and less labor-intensive than building qanats, and Iran had plentiful groundwater at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This shift caused qanats to fall into disrepair, with their contribution to the national water supply dropping from 75% in 1945 to less than 10% by 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Groundwater has rapidly become Iran's primary water source, supplying 55% of the total water in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. A 2021 study by Nature, based on publicly available data, estimated that over 74 cubic kilometers of water were extracted from Iran's ground between 2002 and 2015 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. This volume is comparable to the 34th largest freshwater lake in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

Despite regulations, there is little enforcement of laws designed to control drilling and over-pumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. The number of wells in Iran surged from 47,000 in 1979 to 789,000 in 2013, with almost all of them being illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

## Direct Consequences of Over-extraction

Over-extraction of groundwater leads to a range of severe environmental and geological issues:

### Declining Water Table
As more groundwater is withdrawn, the water table declines, forcing people to drill deeper to access water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. This problem is intensified during serious droughts, which are expected to worsen with climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

### Salinization
The soil and groundwater become saltier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. In some agricultural areas, such as the Karkeh Basin, electrical conductivity measurements (an indicator of salinity) are 85% higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

### Land Subsidence
Declining groundwater levels cause the ground to literally sink, a phenomenon known as subsidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. Iran's land is shrinking by an average of about six centimeters per year, with some areas experiencing a staggering 19 centimeters of subsidence annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. This sinking ground damages critical [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources | infrastructure]], including transmission lines, bridges, and buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. It also undermines structural safety, increasing vulnerability during earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. Furthermore, subsidence can permanently damage an aquifer's capacity to hold water, meaning the lost capacity cannot be recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

## Broader Implications
While population growth contributes to water demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, the core of Iran's water crisis lies in [[consequences_of_ignoring_reservoir_maintenance | demand]] and mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Difficult decisions regarding water usage in homes, industry, and especially agriculture are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. The long-term costs of this water mismanagement are heavy, necessitating comprehensive reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

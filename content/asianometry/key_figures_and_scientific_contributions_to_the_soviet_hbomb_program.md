The hydrogen bomb is a staged thermonuclear weapon possessing terrifying destructive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The United States began developing its hydrogen bomb after the first Soviet atomic bomb test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Remarkably, the Soviets developed their own H-bomb just three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While Soviet advancements in the atomic bomb benefited from espionage, the development of their H-bomb followed a different path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This article explores how Soviet scientists independently developed the hydrogen bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Early Concepts and Intelligence

In September 1941, Italian physicist Enrico Fermi proposed an idea to Hungarian-American physicist Edward Teller, suggesting the atomic bomb could be used to jump-start a deuterium weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This weapon, later known as the "Super," would derive energy from fusing hydrogen into helium, releasing a much larger explosion than fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Teller became obsessed with this concept, and a team at Los Alamos began discussing the theories in the summer of 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

At first, the idea was that neutrons and heat from a fission bomb could initiate a fusion detonation in hydrogen isotopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This would involve a gun-type fission bomb and a cylinder of deuterium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. As deuterium atoms fuse, they release heat that propagates through the cylinder, creating a chain reaction and potentially releasing energy equivalent to a thousand fission bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The power of the explosion could be scaled up by adding more plentiful deuterium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

Problems with this "Classical Super" concept quickly emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. A pure deuterium-deuterium reaction would require hundreds of millions of degrees, more than an A-bomb could achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Physicist Emil Konopinski suggested adding tritium, another hydrogen isotope, to act as a "lighter fluid" to facilitate reactions at lower temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. However, tritium is much rarer and must be produced in nuclear reactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Klaus Fuchs's Contributions

In the spring of 1946, Klaus Fuchs, a British scientist of German origin, joined the project after completing work on atomic bomb detonation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Fuchs, who had been involved in communist organizations since his youth, made several improvements to the Classical Super concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. He suggested encasing the deuterium-tritium mix in a radiation-impervious cladding to contain neutrons and enhance the fusion reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This early form of "radiation implosion" was later patented with John von Neumann <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

After leaving the Manhattan Project for Britain in June 1946, it was discovered that Fuchs had passed critical information on the atomic bomb's design and construction to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. His reports accelerated the Soviet atomic bomb program by at least 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Soviet Response and Key Figures

In September 1945, Soviet scientists began receiving intelligence reports about the Classical Super design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Some Soviet physicists were already exploring the idea, with one sending a memo to Igor Kurchatov, the scientific director of the nuclear program, detailing the concept of using an atomic explosion's heat to produce helium from hydrogen, tapping the "energy source of the stars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

The intelligence reports from the United States detailed the Classical Super design as of late 1945, including a uranium gun-type atomic bomb as a trigger, containers of deuterium and deuterium-tritium, and notes on tritium's role in reducing fusion threshold temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Support for building a Soviet Super gained traction after Professor Marcus Oliphant's remarks were reported in the London Times in October 1945, suggesting the possibility of a "superbomb" 100 times larger than those dropped on Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Yakov Zeldovich and Early Feasibility

Curious, the Soviets added the "superbomb" question to a list of questions for Niels Bohr <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Bohr was skeptical of the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. However, the American intelligence reports spurred the Soviets to pursue the idea, as they were already behind in atomic bomb technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

Igor Kurchatov assigned a working group led by **Yakov Zeldovich** to examine the possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. In December 1945, their document, "Utilization of the nuclear energy of light elements," confirmed the feasibility of a nuclear fusion bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. The group was ordered to continue refining their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. New reports about American work on the "superbomb" continued throughout 1946 and 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

In November 1947, the Zeldovich group proposed propagating a massive shock wave through thermonuclear fuel (deuterium, tritium, and lithium) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The inclusion of lithium was based on another intelligence report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The USSR Council of Ministers accepted this and established Designing Bureau-11 (KB-11) in Sarov, where Zeldovich and his team moved to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

In March 1948, Fuchs provided more detailed discussions of the American superbomb design, including its radiation jacket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. These documents were quickly translated and sent to Stalin and Laventy Beria, head of the NKVD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Alarmed by the perceived American progress, they pushed for accelerating alternative nuclear bomb designs, including the H-bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. In June 1948, the Council of Ministers mandated KB-11 to conduct feasibility studies on a new type of hydrogen bomb, with Fuchs's design forming the basis for the "Tube" design (RDS-6t) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

### Igor Tamm, Andrei Sakharov, and the "Layer Cake"

Kurchatov asked esteemed theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate **Igor Tamm** at the Lebedev Physical Institute to review Zeldovich's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Tamm, believing the Soviet Union needed nuclear weapons, recruited a group of young physicists, including **Andrei Sakharov** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

Tamm, Sakharov, and their colleagues disliked the Zeldovich design and began working on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. By 1948, Sakharov had a promising design called the "First Idea," developed without access to Fuchs's superbomb documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The June 1948 resolution merged the Lebedev and KB-11 teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

Sakharov's design, eventually named RDS-6s, was called "Sloika" or "Layer Cake," reflecting its layered internal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The bomb was a 1.5-meter wide, 4.5-ton sphere, similar in size to the original Soviet atomic bomb or the Fat Man bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. It contained layers of highly enriched uranium and a thermonuclear fuel mix of Lithium Deuteride, Lithium Deuteride Tritide, and a Uranium tamper to maximize yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. These layers were surrounded by chemical explosives to compress them, triggering fission explosions in the outer uranium layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

The inclusion of lithium deuteride came at the suggestion of **Vitalii Ginzburg** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. He pointed out that lithium, when bombarded by neutrons, could create more tritium, providing additional fuel for the fusion explosion. This was known as the "Second Idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. The resulting "Layer Cake" was a fission-fusion-fission device, approximately 80% fission and 20% fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Both Tamm and Zeldovich agreed that the Sloika design had the most potential compared to the Tube/RDS-6t and decided to focus on building it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

## Development and the 1953 Test

Unlike in the United States, there was no debate about whether to proceed with a larger bomb in the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. After shipping their first atomic bomb (RDS-1) in August 1949, the scientists took a short break and returned to work on their "hydrogen bomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

The Layer Cake (RDS-6s) was more of a "boosted" fission bomb than a true thermonuclear device, as most of its energy came from fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. A true staged thermonuclear weapon, like the proposed Classical Super, involves a fission bomb jumpstarting a much larger thermonuclear explosion in two distinct stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

The first Soviet atomic bomb test, RDS-1, ended America's brief nuclear monopoly and raised doubts about their ability to predict the speed of the Soviet nuclear program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. In January 1950, US President Truman ordered the accelerated development of the superbomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

The key challenge for a staged thermonuclear weapon was delivering enough energy to deuterium to initiate fusion before it dissipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. As American scientists worked on this, the Soviets responded to Truman's order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. Zeldovich's team presented the RDS-6s design, and a prototype was authorized for a May 1952 test detonation, though this timeline proved ambitious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

The RDS-6s prototype detonation was rescheduled for August 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. In November 1952, the US detonated Ivy Mike, the first test of a staged thermonuclear device using the Teller-Ulam design, which solved the energy dissipation problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Ivy Mike yielded 10.4 megatons but was a massive, impractical device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

Despite this, Laventy Beria and the Soviet government exerted immense pressure on the scientists to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. On August 8, 1953, Georgy Malenkov announced that the United States would not have a thermonuclear monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Four days later, Kurchatov initiated the countdown at the Semipalatinsk test site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. The RDS-6s, known as Joe-4 in the United States, was a successful detonation, yielding 400 kilotons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. While the US considered it a "boosted fission device" with limited scalability, RDS-6s was compact enough for practical use as a weapon, unlike Ivy Mike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

## The "Third Idea" and True Hydrogen Bomb

Soviet weapons designers initially believed they could scale the Layer Cake design to 1 or 2 megatons, but they eventually hit practical limits in terms of device size and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

At this time, a more compelling idea emerged. While working on the "Tube" design (inspired by Fuchs's 1948 material), scientists discussed using compression to heat thermonuclear fuel to millions of degrees to trigger a fusion reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. This concept of compression was repeatedly advocated by lab director **Viktor Davidenko** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. Scientists initially explored using the trigger atomic bomb's shock wave or material explosion for compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

Then, in the Spring of 1954, several scientists independently realized that during an atomic explosion, the majority of released energy comes in the form of X-rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. They pondered whether this radiation energy could be used for compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. This idea, known as "Sakharov's Third Idea" (though Sakharov was not its sole originator), aligned with the concepts behind the American Teller-Ulam hydrogen bomb design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

There is no indication that the Soviets used US intelligence for this breakthrough; it developed organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. While Fuchs's design contained concepts of radiation implosion, its significance was not recognized by either the Soviets or Americans until later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

Work on the less efficient Layer Cake and Tube bombs was abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. The Soviet team crafted a physical design to fully implement the radiation implosion concept, leading to the device called RDS-37 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. Existing infrastructure and supply chains from the Layer Cake contributed to its rapid development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

RDS-37 was detonated on November 22, 1955, with a yield of 1.6 megatons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. The Soviet Union had achieved the hydrogen bomb and parity with the United States much faster than anticipated in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

While some claim Ivy Mike's fallout helped guide the Soviets by revealing elements exposed to high neutron counts via compression, contemporary archives suggest the Soviets lacked the necessary skill or technology for such radiological measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. Instead, Ivy Mike and the subsequent 1954 Castle Bravo detonation demonstrated to the Soviets that such a massive weapon was indeed possible, suggesting "something else" was involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

Soviet scientists take immense pride in their achievement, having closed the hydrogen bomb gap with the United States in just a few short years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. In their view, their work prevented a nuclear war, marking a new stage in the rivalry between the two superpowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. This highlights the [[comparisons_between_soviet_and_american_nuclear_weapons_development|differences in Soviet and American nuclear weapons development]] where internal drives and independent scientific breakthroughs played a crucial role in the [[development_of_the_hydrogen_bomb_by_the_soviet_union|development of the hydrogen bomb by the Soviet Union]].

The Soviet Union, in its final years, became ensnared in a significant resource trap, turning to natural resources when its agricultural, industrial, and consumption goods sectors struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Despite being abundant in natural resources like massive oil and gas fields, and rich iron ore and coal mines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, this reliance led to economic difficulties.

## Aging Mines and Declining Productivity
By the 1970s, the Soviet Union's ore mines were aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. The government, dependent on the hard currency generated by these exports, continued to invest heavily into these declining mines in an attempt to extract more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Similarly, oil fields were losing productivity by the late 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Investment costs in oil rose from 28% to 39% of the total Soviet investment budget between 1975 and 1985, and employment in the sector soared by 25%, yet actual oil output declined by 21% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## The Oil Price "Luck Out" and Subsequent Crash
An external event, the 1973 oil embargo by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, saw oil prices jump from $3 to $12 a barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. The Soviet Union benefited from this as one of the few large oil suppliers able to sell to embargoed countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. They had strategically shifted to using natural gas domestically to free up oil for export and acquire hard currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Consequently, Soviet exports to the West, largely fueled by oil, grew by 26% from 1970 to 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

However, this reliance on oil exports created a precarious situation. The high cost of oil extraction diverted resources that could have been used to improve agricultural and domestic consumer industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. The economy's sustainability depended on high oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

The situation changed dramatically with the 1980s oil glut, triggered when Saudi Arabia ended the embargo and returned to the oil market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This, combined with a mini-recession, caused oil prices to crash from $40 in 1979 to under $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This precipitous drop in prices signaled the [[collapse_of_the_soviet_union_linked_to_oil_and_gas_industry_challenges | beginning of the end for the Soviet economy]], as it lacked sufficient foreign currency income to fund its operations, leading to effective bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

The [[economic_challenges_of_early_soviet_union | Soviet Union's economic model]], while achieving significant growth by accumulating capital in its early decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, failed to adapt when its growth engines sputtered due to fundamental demographic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. The inability to diversify away from its natural resource dependence and handle external shocks ultimately contributed to its economic downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

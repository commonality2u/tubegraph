On October 16, 1964, at 3:00 PM, the People's Republic of China (PRC) successfully detonated its first domestically produced atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. With this achievement, China joined the United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain as one of the five atomic powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It took China less than five years to produce a working nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Motivation for Nuclear Development

When the United States was the sole possessor of the atomic bomb, Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party leadership feared potential American nuclear intervention in the Chinese Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. During his visit to Stalin in December 1949 to negotiate China's entry into the Soviet Bloc, Mao sought the assurance of a nuclear umbrella over his "precarious country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

The Soviets, who had only recently broken the Western nuclear monopoly, were reluctant to explicitly grant such a guarantee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The initial text of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance stated that in the event of an invasion, the other signatory country "shall render assistance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Zhou Enlai suggested adding the clause "with all means at its disposal," which was eventually accepted after initial Soviet resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. However, no formal writing ever mentioned nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### The Korean War and Nuclear Blackmail

These assurances were soon tested during the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. As American forces approached the Yalu River, the border with China, the Chinese leadership worried about a potential American invasion of communist China and the use of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Mao decided to intervene, believing in China's manpower advantage and that the U.S. would not risk all-out nuclear warfare with the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Mao's gamble paid off; the Americans did not use nuclear weapons, although they did threaten to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

After the Korean War, the U.S. continued to hold the nuclear weapons issue over China's head, which the Chinese leadership called "nuclear blackmail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles described the Chinese Communist Regime as "consistently and viciously hostile to the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   General Curtis LeMay, commander of the Strategic Air Command, stated in 1954 that while there were "no suitable Strategic Air Targets in Korea," he "would drop a few bombs in proper places in China, Manchuria, and Southeastern Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   During the First Taiwan Strait Crisis (1954-1955), U.S. military leadership recommended the use of nuclear weapons, though President Eisenhower ultimately refrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   In December 1954, the U.S. and the Republic of China signed a mutual defense treaty, which the Communists believed would embolden the Kuomintang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

This series of crises gave China's nuclear program a special urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, although Mao and the Communist Party likely would have pursued an atomic weapon anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Early Sino-Soviet Nuclear Cooperation

Mao's first instinct was to approach the Soviets, who were China's largest external trading partner, provided loans, and assisted in soviet-style industrial development and military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Stalin's Reluctance

China had long known about the [[development_of_the_hydrogen_bomb_by_the_soviet_union | Soviet nuclear program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. A few weeks before the first Soviet detonation in 1949, a Chinese Communist Party delegation led by Liu Shaoqi visited Stalin and asked to tour nuclear installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Stalin, perhaps surprised, instead arranged a nuclear testing documentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. He never transferred any atomic technology while alive, only offering the "protection" of their nuclear umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Khrushchev's Shift in Policy

After Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev became leader of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Khrushchev sought Chinese support to boost his domestic influence and achieve his goal of de-Stalinization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In September 1954, he emphasized the importance of helping China develop its industry to solidify their friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

During a delegation to the PRC in October 1954, Mao asked Khrushchev for assistance with China's nuclear weapons program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Khrushchev was caught by surprise and initially tried to dissuade China, urging them to focus on economic development and reminding them of the Soviet nuclear umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. However, the Chinese insisted, and the Soviets eventually agreed to cooperate on certain items for peaceful atomic energy use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

In April 1955, the PRC and Soviet Union signed the [[sinosoviet_nuclear_cooperation_and_its_challenges | Sino-Soviet Atomic Cooperation Treaty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Under this treaty, the Soviets agreed to provide an experimental nuclear power plant and a cyclotron to China and other Eastern European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. They sent nuclear experts, showed atomic energy films, and gave lectures to Chinese scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Soviet scientists also explored China's uranium reserves in Xinjiang, with any surplus uranium to be exported to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. In February 1956, Khrushchev expanded cooperation to include sending more Chinese students to the Soviet Union and helping to build nuclear research facilities in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Contribution of [[chinese_scientists_contributions_to_nuclear_development | Chinese Scientists]]

Despite the high point in [[sinosoviet_nuclear_cooperation_and_its_challenges | Sino-Soviet relations]], Mao and his colleagues viewed it as an alliance of convenience and sought to maximize transferred knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. China significantly increased its science research funding from $15 million in 1955 to $100 million in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The Chinese Academy of Sciences received substantial funds, primarily for purchasing Western science literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

The Chinese nuclear program recruited some of the nation's best minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. It greatly benefited from the return of Chinese-born scientists who had been educated or worked in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Notable examples include:
*   Dr. Qian Xuesen, co-founder of the Jet Propulsion Lab, who returned to China after controversially losing his job in the U.S. due to accusations of communist sympathies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   Chen Wei Tung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   Chen San Chang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   Peng Huanwu, a quantum physicist with two doctorates who was the first Chinese student of Nobel Prize winner Max Born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Peng studied uranium fission and gamma rays at The Curie Institute in Paris before becoming director of The Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences upon his return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

Despite their patriotism, these scientists faced unfair attacks from far-left elements of the Communist Party of China as "rightist intellectuals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Zhou Enlai held a landmark meeting in 1956 to try and end the persecution, but scientists only found peace after being relocated from cities to remote locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Nuclear Weapons Technology Transfer

By 1957, Soviet transfers were accelerating reactor design for peaceful atomic energy, an area where China already had substantial knowledge from published Western literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. A nuclear weapon, however, required specialized techniques and extensive infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The Soviets initially resisted sharing design or production knowledge about nuclear weapons themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### The 1957 Agreement

In late October 1956, anti-communist protests in Hungary and Poland weakened the Soviets, making them more reliant on China's backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This leverage came with a price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. In 1957, Khrushchev decided, against the advice of his military and Ivan Kurchatov (the "father of the Soviet Atomic program"), to transfer atomic bomb technology to the Chinese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

Thus, in October 1957, the Chinese and Soviets signed the "Agreement on Production of New Weapons and Military Technology Equipment and Establishment of a Comprehensive Atomic Energy Industry in China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This agreement stipulated that the Soviets would provide, among other things:
*   A teaching model atomic bomb, complete with designs and documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   Technology for casings, processing uranium and plutonium, and testing guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

There is debate over how helpful these transfers ultimately were for the Chinese nuclear weapons program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Khrushchev claimed in his memoirs that they gave China "almost everything they asked for" and kept "no secrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. However, Soviets told their scientists to limit what they said, leading them to be "extremely passive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

The Chinese were not impressed, particularly regarding nuclear weapons design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. A Soviet lecture on July 15, 1958, covered nuclear weapon theory, structure, and assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. While the Soviets believed they revealed top secrets, no documents were given—only a basic sketch on a blackboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The audience was mostly administrative personnel, not scientists, and no parameters or formulas were provided, nor were notes allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The Chinese later claimed this lecture contained "completely wrong data" that misled their scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Dr. Chen San Chang, already familiar with theoretical concepts from his time in the U.S., stated that the information was similar to what was available from "capitalist countries" but with "a few more details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The subsequent Sino-Soviet split complicates sorting out these opposing claims, as both sides were incentivized to either inflate or downplay their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

Regardless, the scale of technology transferred outside of nuclear weapons development was massive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. The two countries collaborated on uranium prospecting and mining efforts in Xinjiang, although China claimed Soviet aid here was not particularly helpful, as they pushed for prospecting in sedimentary soils, while China's best deposits were in granite and igneous rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Most critically, the Soviets handed over some of their best missiles, including the R-12 intercontinental ballistic missile, free of charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. This period of deep military technology cooperation lasted from 1957 to 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

## The Sino-Soviet Split and its [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_chinas_nuclear_program | Impact on China's Nuclear Program]]

The [[sinosoviet_nuclear_cooperation_and_its_challenges | Sino-Soviet split]] was a complex process with issues emerging as early as 1956, when Khrushchev delivered his secret speech criticizing Stalin's Cult of Personality, which infuriated Mao Zedong as an indirect attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. In November 1957, Mao stated at the Moscow Conference that if half of mankind died in a nuclear war, "the other half would remain... and the whole world would become socialism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. These comments dismayed Khrushchev and the Soviet leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

### Withdrawal of Aid

One of the key deliverables in the October 1957 agreement was a teaching bomb prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. However, due to Mao's controversial remarks just a month after the agreement, the Soviet leadership decided in early 1958 to renege on this deliverable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Khrushchev explained that they decided to postpone sending the prototype due to deteriorating relations with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Throughout 1958, there were endless delays, and the Soviets eventually postponed the bomb transfer indefinitely, citing concerns about straining relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

The Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958 further heightened tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. Mao initiated shelling of the Kinmen and Matsu islands, threatening nuclear war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Khrushchev realized he had made a "horrible mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, leading him to send a letter in June 1959 informing the Chinese of the termination of military cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. Soviet military advisers were recalled, with the last one leaving in July 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

Ultimately, 40% of the promised equipment and raw materials never arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Of the 30 [[sinosoviet_nuclear_cooperation_and_its_challenges | Sino-Soviet nuclear industry projects]], only a minority were completed, and nine had to be entirely shut down, forcing China to start over in many cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. While the withdrawal was a blow, it was not entirely unexpected, as PLA leaders believed the Soviets aimed to maintain a technical gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

## China's Indigenous Nuclear Program: Project 596

In January 1960, China launched the "596 Project," named to commemorate the "shameful date" when Soviet aid was withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. Zhou Enlai declared that China would achieve a breakthrough in three years, master technical know-how in five, and have a stockpile of bombs in eight, "using their own hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

Amidst the economic and social pressures of the Great Leap Forward, China abandoned its dual-track approach (plutonium and uranium-235) and focused solely on the uranium-235 design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

### The Lanzhou Gaseous Diffusion Plant

The last Soviet advisers left the Lanzhou facility in July 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Plant leader Wang Jie, desperate to absorb all possible knowledge, personally escorted the last five advisers to the airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Their departure forced Chinese technicians to take over, sorting through and sourcing tens of thousands of raw materials and supplies for the U-235 production line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

The Lanzhou plant faced significant challenges:
*   Technicians, caught up in Great Leap Forward fervor, started disassembling Soviet-provided electrical equipment for "technological innovation," requiring a direct appeal from Minister of Mechanical Industry Song Renqiong to Mao Zedong to stop them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.
*   Food shortages in 1960 impacted staff, but Wang Jie refused to slow progress, cutting rations and personally foraging for herbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

Despite these difficulties, progress was made. By the end of 1961, about 700 days after the Soviet aid severance, the Lanzhou plant's machinery was successfully installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The Chinese found reasonable substitutes for many Soviet components, including a special lubricant for gaseous diffusion pumps that the Soviet advisers had kept locked away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. By mid-1963, Lanzhou scientists were successfully isolating uranium-235 in mass, and by January 1964, 90% enrichment was achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. Mao Zedong, upon receiving the report, simply wrote, "Very good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

## Bomb Design and Assembly

A nuclear explosion results from an uncontrolled fission chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. The first American bomb, dropped on Hiroshima, used a "gun design," but this was superseded by an implosion design, used for the Nagasaki bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. The Chinese eventually chose the implosion design because it required less physical material, but they used uranium-235 instead of plutonium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

The key challenge for the Chinese bomb design was properly synchronizing the high explosives to initiate the nuclear chain reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. A timing issue could lead to stray neutrons and an unsatisfactory performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Unlike the British, who had scientists working at Los Alamos, China lacked such direct access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. However, they knew a bomb was possible and understood the theoretical principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

By the time the Soviets left in 1960, the Chinese had completed their theoretical work and were ready for actual design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. They were aided by "sloppy shredding" on the part of the Soviets, allowing them to piece together critical papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Working in the Beijing suburbs, a team used hand calculators for complicated equations and simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. By the end of 1962, they had mastered the theory behind implosions, and a year later, they had the final design for their implosion mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.

In late 1963, the uranium arrived at the nuclear component manufacturing plant in Subei, Gansu Province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. A team of master craftsmen machined it into a ball of highly enriched uranium and then packaged it into the "596 bomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

## International Reaction and Costs

The successful nuclear test caught both the Americans and Soviets off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. The American government had known about China's nuclear weapons program since 1959 and considered intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. President Kennedy expressed concern in 1961 that a nuclear China would lead to the fall of Southeast Asia to communists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. In the early 1960s, Kennedy explored military intervention with Khrushchev, but Khrushchev never pursued the idea, and some Kennedy administration members downplayed the military consequences of a nuclear China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

China's decision to use an implosion-type bomb with uranium rather than plutonium confused American intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. While they knew about the gaseous diffusion plant in Lanzhou, they mistakenly thought it was too small for a real nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. The Americans underestimated China's nuclear effort and did not realize their mistake until the eve of the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

China's indigenous nuclear bomb program was one of its largest undertakings, involving several hundred thousand people across more than 900 factories, research institutes, and schools in 20 provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. For an undeveloped nation, it incurred staggering costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. Later estimates placed the 10-year nuclear weapons program's total cost at about 10.7 billion RMB, or $4.1 billion in 1957 prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>. Much of this expenditure occurred during the economically difficult years of the Great Leap Forward and the early 1960s, forcing cuts in other government projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

Scholars debate the extent to which China's program benefited from [[role_of_soviet_technology_transfer_in_chinas_nuclear_development | Soviet technology transfer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. In 1966, Deng Xiaoping told the Romanian Ambassador that without the Soviets breaking their treaty, China would not have built the bombs so fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. While the Soviets provided substantial aid, their withdrawal spurred China to redouble its efforts and instilled the "force of will" needed to finish the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The National Steel Corporation (NSC) was once a symbol of Philippine industrial pride, recognized as one of the largest companies in the country and a rare example of a well-managed government-owned enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Over two decades, NSC employed more than 4,000 workers in Iligan City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The Philippines had a head start in building a steel industry compared to most other Asian countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Despite its potential to become a global giant, a combination of factors led to its decline and eventual failure by 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Foundations of the Philippine Steel Industry

Following World War II, the Philippine economy was primarily agricultural and semi-colonial, with significant foreign dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While lacking petroleum reserves like Indonesia or Malaysia, the country possessed abundant metallic minerals such as iron, copper, gold, and nickel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. President Carlos Garcia initiated an industrialization drive, viewing these minerals as crucial for an industrialized future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The absence of adequate steel facilities necessitated exporting iron ore to Japan and then re-importing finished steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Establishing domestic steel and rolling mills would enable the country to construct its own ships, roads, and electric power infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, potentially leading to specialty alloys and industrial chemicals production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This vision highlighted the need for an integrated steel mill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Steelmaking Processes

The steel industry primarily utilizes two methods:
1.  **Integrated Steel Mills**: This vertically integrated process refines iron ore into steel through four main steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>:
    *   **Sintering**: Heating fine iron ore with coal and other materials to create sinter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   **Pig Iron Production**: Creating a high-carbon intermediary product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
    *   **Steel Creation**: Placing pig iron into a blast furnace with fuel and oxygen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Modern steelmaking also includes a secondary step to remove dissolved gases and add alloys for higher quality steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   **Finishing**: Transforming semi-finished steel into bars, sheets, wires, and tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    These steps are typically performed within a single integrated facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
2.  **Mini Mills**: A newer method that emerged over time, using scrap metal as a primary input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Mini steel plants use electricity to melt scrap metal, remove impurities, and recast it into new steel products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This process is cheaper than using iron ore due to fewer steps, though the resulting steel was initially considered inferior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Early mini mills in the 1950s and 60s focused on low-margin rebar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. However, mini mills improved over time, moving up the market and disrupting the older integrated steel mills throughout the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Early Efforts: NASCO and ISMI

In 1950, the Philippine government established the National Shipyard and Steel Corporation (NASCO) in Iligan City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This government-owned corporation used scrap metal to produce ingots, bars, steel shapes, and rods, primarily for shipbuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The idea was to build ships domestically and gain export experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

In 1955, NASCO received 50 million pesos to set up pig iron plants, which would convert it into an integrated steel mill, making it Asia's second such facility after Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. However, a currency crisis affected NASCO's plans, requiring foreign loans to purchase steel-making equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In 1958, President Garcia secured a $62.4 million loan from the United States Export-Import (Exim) Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This loan came with two conditions: the money had to be spent exclusively on American steel-making equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, and NASCO had to undergo [[privatization_and_mismanagement_of_national_steel_corporation | privatization_and_mismanagement_of_national_steel_corporation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, with 49% sold to a private investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This condition was reportedly due to past bureaucratic inefficiencies or demands from American steel companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

The joint venture Iligan Integrated Steel Mills (IISMI) was established, with Jacinto Steel winning the private investor bid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. By 1962, the Jacintos had acquired full ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. The delays in the [[privatization_and_mismanagement_of_national_steel_corporation | privatization_and_mismanagement_of_national_steel_corporation]] process caused problems, as the initial $62 million was no longer sufficient for a full integrated steel mill, only a cold and hot rolling mill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The government guaranteed the Exim Bank loan and the Bank of the Philippines lent IISMI another 30 million pesos to complete the integrated steel mill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

IISMI struggled with profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. One perspective suggests the Jacintos used IISMI to cross-subsidize other family businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Another view highlights the government's failure to adequately protect the company, as IISMI faced domestic competition and lacked the government support seen by steel companies in other Asian nations, such as Japan's subsidies, import bans, and tax incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The cold and hot rolling mill was completed between 1967 and 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. IISMI requested another $70 million loan to finish the blast furnace by 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

The 1970s brought global oil price shocks and economic turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. In 1970, the peso devalued from 3.50 to 6.50 to a dollar, increasing the cost of imported goods and making it difficult for indebted industrialists to service their foreign currency debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. President Ferdinand Marcos did not favor the Jacinto family, leading the Development Bank of the Philippines to foreclose on IISMI's loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. After martial law was declared in 1972, the military seized IISMI's assets and transferred them to National Steel Corporation (NSC), a Development Bank subsidiary, a process completed in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## National Steel Corporation: A Golden Age

The government established NSC to stabilize the steel industry, preserve thousands of jobs, and save creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. In its early years, NSC focused on survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. To prevent major loan losses for banks exposed to bankrupt local steel factories, NSC merged with several of these entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This expanded its capacity from 141,000 tons in 1974 to 452,000 tons by 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

By 1979, NSC exited survival mode and became the country's 11th largest corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. It was the Philippines' leading producer of billets, tin plates, and flat rolled steel, holding a monopoly over the domestic steel industry for the next two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. NSC specialized in flat steel products, exporting them to China, Indonesia, and the United States, where its products were preferred over domestic competitors despite shipping costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

NSC was a significant contributor to Iligan City, providing up to 75% of the city's total revenues in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The company offered extensive health care and housing benefits to its 4,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The lowest basic salary was 8,000 pesos a month, substantially higher than the average hourly wage of 9 to 20 pesos at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Employees also received 10 to 15 annual salary increases, mid-year and year-end bonuses, and sick leave monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. NSC employees were known as "steeltowners," part of a "high-class village," often well-dressed and proud of their association with the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Despite the turmoil of the 1980s, the company experienced only one strike in 22 years, and employee turnover was below one percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### [[challenges_faced_by_the_philippine_steel_industry | Challenges Faced by the Philippine Steel Industry]]

The 1980s brought trade reforms that reduced steel product tariffs to three percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, leading to a flood of cheap imports from Taiwan and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Despite this, NSC remained profitable in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The company invested 27 billion pesos in system computerization and other upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, as the market for its core flat steel products began to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

While NSC still turned a profit in the early 1990s (e.g., 538 million pesos in 1991), profits were trending downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. The flat steel market was increasingly dominated by cheaper South Korean and Taiwanese imports, necessitating upgrades for incumbents, with many moving into coils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. NSC's management recognized the need for further investment to stay competitive, particularly to build iron and steel making capabilities as it was not yet a truly vertically integrated steel maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. However, the government, with too much exposure to state-owned corporations, lacked the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

## Decline and Closure

Under President Fidel Ramos, the government decided to seek a private investor for NSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. In 1993, a majority share in NSC was auctioned off, with the winning bidder required to continue NSC's business plans and maintain global competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. The winner was Wintek Holdings, a Malaysian company, and the transaction was finalized in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Many NSC employees mark this year as the end of their prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### [[privatization_and_mismanagement_of_national_steel_corporation | Privatization and Mismanagement of National Steel Corporation]]

The core issue with Wintek Holdings was that they were foreign steel traders, not steel makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Their top management lacked understanding of steel production, a fact the Philippine government (which retained a 12.5% share) should have recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The CEO did not even relocate to the Philippines, commuting from Kuala Lumpur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Management stopped holding planning meetings, eroding employee trust, and switched suppliers to their own trading corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

In late 1995, the new management ordered a large quantity of raw steel goods at peak prices, leading to significant financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. They also restricted financial disclosures to banks, creating opportunities for potential fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Losses skyrocketed, and in 1995, NSC laid off employees for the first time since 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Despite 1996 being one of the best economic years for the Philippines, NSC lost an unprecedented 2 billion pesos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

In early 1997, Wintek sold NSC to another Malaysian trading firm, Hotec Investment Limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Hotec was highly leveraged, having borrowed approximately $800 million USD for the acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 severely impacted their plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Hotec also installed a Malaysian top management team with no relevant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Planned upgrades never materialized, and previous upgrades suffered from a lack of maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Meanwhile, cheap imported products continued to enter the market, highlighting the [[impact_of_foreign_competition_on_philippine_steel_companies | impact of foreign competition on Philippine steel companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. The crisis led to another massive devaluation of the peso, making NSC's U.S. dollar-denominated loans and raw materials prohibitively expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Creditors and suppliers ended their relationships with NSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Employees took early retirement buyouts, further straining company finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. An intervention attempt by the city government failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

In November 1999, NSC ceased operations, resulting in 1,800 remaining employees losing their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

## Aftermath and Legacy

### [[economic_and_social_impact_of_national_steel_corporations_closure | Economic and Social Impact of National Steel Corporation's Closure]]

The closure of NSC had profound [[economic_and_social_impact_of_national_steel_corporations_closure | economic and social impact]] on Iligan City and its supporting industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. City revenues dropped by 72 million pesos that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Losses to supporting businesses were estimated at 1.4 billion pesos annually, with local scrap metal collectors, service contractors, and the power utility suffering the most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. While cheap imports contributed to the decline of NSC's original core markets, NSC was still profitable until 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Ultimately, the company's downfall is largely attributed to falling into the hands of an incompetent management team, followed by an unprecedented financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

### Failed Revival Attempts

In 2004, an Indian group formed Global Steel Philippines Inc. (GSPI) to purchase NSC's idled assets, which still held some value despite being inactive for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. It was later revealed that these investors were connected to ArcelorMittal, then the world's second-largest steel company, suggesting legitimate experience in steelmaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. However, GSPI also failed to take off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Although it produced and shipped some flat steel, it operated far below capacity due to a chronic lack of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. GSPI's unsuccessful attempts to secure additional national government support and an adversarial relationship with the local community and government led to another closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

Periodically, proposals for NSC's revival emerge, but none have materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. Today, the 145-hectare plant and its adjacent 600-unit housing complex in Iligan City stand mostly unused, most recently serving as a quarantine center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, serving as a reminder of what could have been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

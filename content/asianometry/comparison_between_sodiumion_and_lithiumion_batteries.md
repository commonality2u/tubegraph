Scientists began developing sodium-ion batteries concurrently with lithium-ion batteries. However, lithium-ion technology eventually gained dominance, while sodium-ion research saw a decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in sodium-ion batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

## Structural and Manufacturing Similarities
Sodium-ion batteries share a similar structure with [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion batteries]], both featuring a cathode, an anode, a porous separator, and an electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>. The primary difference lies in the specific compounds used for their components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>. A significant advantage is that commercial [[commercialization_and_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] can leverage the same engineering and production methods as [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:29">[01:25:29]</a>. This similarity allows companies like [[introduction_to_catls_sodiumion_battery | CATL]] to integrate sodium-ion offerings into their existing [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion]] infrastructure and product ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:34">[11:17:34]</a>.

## Raw Material Availability and Cost
The single biggest advantage of [[raw_material_availability_and_costs_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] over [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion batteries]] is the availability and cost of raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:48">[01:33:48]</a>.
*   **Lithium**: Almost all of the world's lithium comes from four countries: Australia, Chile, China, and Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>. Its extraction is not particularly easy nor environmentally friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Critical elements like cobalt, often used in [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion batteries]], also pose significant environmental and humanitarian concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:39">[01:54:39]</a>.
*   **Sodium**: The global supply of sodium is essentially unlimited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:26">[02:01:26]</a>. There is over 1,000 times more sodium than lithium in the Earth's crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>. This translates to a raw ingredient cost of $150 per ton for sodium compared to $5,000 for lithium, a 30-times decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:07">[02:09:07]</a>.

Despite cheaper raw materials, the overall cost of [[commercialization_and_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] to end-users will not be drastically lower than [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion batteries]] due to significant overlap in preparatory processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:03">[11:34:03]</a>. One estimate suggests end-users could see 10% to 30% price savings, assuming all other factors are equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:57">[11:53:57]</a>.

## Historical Context and Renewed Interest
[[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | Researchers tried to commercialize sodium-ion batteries]] alongside [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion batteries]] in the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:03">[02:20:03]</a>. Early attempts, like Ford's sodium-sulfur battery (1968), faced challenges such as requiring very high operating temperatures (570 to 660 degrees Fahrenheit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:26">[03:00:26]</a>. The successful commercialization of the [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion battery]] by Sony in 1989 led to [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion]] dominating the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:22">[04:18:22]</a>.

However, concerns emerged in the 2000s regarding the limited supply of [[raw_material_availability_and_costs_of_sodiumion_batteries | lithium]] and complex intellectual property rights surrounding [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:07">[04:41:07]</a>. This spurred a renewed look at [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion batteries]] in the 2010s, particularly those operating at room temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:20">[05:15:20]</a>. The number of publications related to [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion batteries]] has since rapidly increased, even surpassing [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion]] in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:04">[05:21:04]</a>.

## Performance and Energy Density
When comparing performance:
*   **Ionization Potential**: Sodium has a lower ionization potential (or energy) than lithium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:09">[08:50:09]</a>. This means [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | sodium-ion batteries]] will inherently have lower energy densities and operating voltages than their [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion counterparts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:21">[08:54:21]</a>. It is currently unclear if [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | sodium-ion]] can ever match top-line [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion batteries]] in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:07">[09:02:07]</a>.
*   **Energy Density**:
    *   An 18650 cell (a standard format) [[commercialization_and_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion battery]] prototype from CNRS CEA in 2015 reported an energy density of about 90 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:16">[08:05:16]</a>.
    *   A more advanced [[commercialization_and_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion battery]] announced by Washington State University and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in 2020 speculated to achieve 160 Wh/kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:07">[08:31:07]</a>. This is comparable to current [[advantages_and_disadvantages_of_lfp_batteries | lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:08">[08:43:08]</a>.
    *   [[introduction_to_catls_sodiumion_battery | CATL's first-generation sodium-ion battery]] can achieve energy densities of up to 160 Wh/kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:49">[10:54:49]</a>, with a second generation hoping for over 200 Wh/kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

## Applications and Use Cases
While [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | sodium-ion batteries]] may never replace [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion]] in certain use cases like mobile phones and other electronic gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:36">[12:58:36]</a>, they show significant potential in areas where space is less of a constraint, making their lower energy density less of a confounding factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>:
*   **Short-range Electric Vehicles (EVs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:34">[13:07:34]</a>
*   **Stationary Power Systems**: Especially for grid stabilization and energy storage for solar and wind renewables, where scale benefits from cost savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:04">[13:10:04]</a>.

Some companies, including [[introduction_to_catls_sodiumion_battery | CATL]], are exploring hybrid systems that can mix and match [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | sodium-ion]] and [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion batteries]] into a single system, where the higher energy density [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion batteries]] are used when [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | sodium-ion]] falls short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:18">[12:02:18]</a>.

### Anodes and Cathodes
*   **Anodes**: Most studies have converged on using "hard carbon" (colloquially, charcoal) for anodes in [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | sodium-ion batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. [[introduction_to_catls_sodiumion_battery | CATL]] also uses a hard carbon anode with a unique porous structure to lengthen cycle lifetime and improve sodium-ion movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:19">[09:42:19]</a>.
*   **Cathodes**: This area has seen significant research. Common candidates include sodium layered oxides, which have a crystalline structure similar to lithium cobalt oxide used in [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:10">[06:35:10]</a>. Other candidates include sulfides, phosphates, and vanadium-based polyanionic compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:48">[07:14:48]</a>. [[introduction_to_catls_sodiumion_battery | CATL]] has chosen "Prussian white" for its cathodes, an analog of Prussian blue, which is cheap, easily made, non-toxic, and shows good discharge rates and capacity retention over many cycles (up to 95% retention after 10,000 cycles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. A drawback of Prussian blue cathodes is capacity loss in the presence of moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:26">[10:36:26]</a>.

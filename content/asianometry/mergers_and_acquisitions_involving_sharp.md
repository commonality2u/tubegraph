Japan's Sharp Corporation, known for its iconic products like the mechanical pencil, calculators, and TVs, faced increasing competition starting at the turn of the century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This led to significant financial challenges, ultimately culminating in foreign takeovers and strategic partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Initial Growth and Product Diversification
Founded by Takuji Hayakawa, Sharp began as a metal workshop in Tokyo in 1912 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Hayakawa's early inventions, like the "tokubido" belt buckle and the superior Hayakawa mechanical pencil, quickly led to business expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. After a devastating earthquake in 1923, Hayakawa rebuilt his business in Osaka, venturing into crystal radios and eventually vacuum tube radios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

The company, renamed Hayakawa Electric Company in 1942, diversified into various electronics, including Japan's first commercially available television in 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. They also produced Japan's first microwave and solar-powered consumer electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. A key product that put Sharp on the global map was its line of calculators, starting with the CS-10A Comat in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The company's name officially changed to Sharp Corporation in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## Strategic Shift to LCDs and Missed Opportunities
By the late 1990s, Sharp's profits were in decline, with its LCD panels and related products being the company's one bright spot, responsible for 30% of revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. In 1998, President Katsuhiko Machida repositioned Sharp's LCD business at its core, aiming for every product to be related to LCD technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. This bold pivot involved ditching their venerable CRT television business and going all-in on LCD televisions with the Aquos brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

Despite initial success, with Aquos capturing 80% global market share in the young LCD TV market by 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, competition from South Korean giants like Samsung and LG rapidly caught up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. Sharp responded by investing billions into new TFT LCD factories, such as the Kamiyama plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>, a move that strained company finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

## Failed Partnership with Sony
In 2007, Sharp announced a new set of factories in Sakai, Osaka, projected to cost 3.4 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. To secure buyers for the massive output, Sharp reached out to fellow Japanese TV makers, including Sony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. In February 2008, Sony, then the second-largest LCD manufacturer, announced an agreement to take a 33% ownership share in the Sakai factories, named Sharp Display Products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

However, Sharp failed to properly manage relations between its TV and display panel divisions, causing its own Aquos TV sales to compete with Sony's products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. This led to shortages and delays for Sony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. Ultimately, Sony did not go through with its planned 33% purchase, never owned more than seven percent, and eventually sold its entire stake back to Sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

## The Global Financial Crisis and Mounting Losses
The global financial crisis hit Sharp hard in 2008, leading to sales collapse and increased losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. In March 2009, Sharp announced its first net loss since going public in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. Despite admitting mistakes in local production investment, they continued to invest heavily in Sakai Display (formerly Sharp Display Products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

By 2009, Sharp's TV market share plummeted to 6-7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>, while operating utilization for the Sakai plant fell to less than 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. The inability to balance LCD panel supply and TV businesses led to losses in both sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. By March 2012, Sharp's sales had declined by $10 billion from 2008, and the company posted a net loss of over $5 billion, nearing bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

## Foxconn's Acquisition of Sharp
In 2012, Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics manufacturing giant, purchased a 9.9% stake in Sharp for approximately $854 million, along with a larger share in Sakai Display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Foxconn's interest stemmed from its "land and expand" business model, aiming to vertically integrate its supply chain by acquiring component manufacturers, with displays being the most expensive component in electronics gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. Foxconn had previously helped Taiwan's Innolux acquire other display companies to become a major TFT LCD panel maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

Foxconn initially sought a more substantial partnership or even an acquisition, but Sharp declined for several more years despite continued losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. In 2012, Sony, Toshiba, and Hitachi merged their LCD divisions to create Japan Display Inc. (JDI), which competed directly with Sharp, causing further pain to both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. Sharp also missed critical industry transitions, such as the shift to LED backlit LCD screens and OLED technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

After a staggering $5 billion loss in March 2013, Sharp's top leadership exited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. By 2013, Sharp and Fujitsu were losing their grip on the Japanese domestic smartphone market to Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

In 2016, after three more difficult years, Sharp finally accepted Foxconn's offer to purchase a controlling 66% stake for $6.2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. However, Foxconn revised the offer down to $3.8 billion upon discovering new financial liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. Despite other proposals, Sharp's bank creditors sided with Foxconn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. This acquisition marked the first foreign takeover of a leading Japanese electronics firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

## Post-Acquisition Era
Under Taiwanese management, led by new CEO Tai Jung-woo, Sharp cut costs, closed unprofitable overseas ventures, reduced employees, and moved production out of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. In its first full year under Foxconn, Sharp turned a profit for the first time in four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Tai reoriented the company back towards producing branded electronics products and Foxconn began rebuilding Sharp's semiconductor manufacturing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.

Compaq Computer Company's early years were marked by remarkable growth, with first-year revenue reaching $111 million in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The company achieved $1.2 billion in revenue by 1987, the fastest in history at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. [[Compaqs Rise and Early Success | Compaq]] led an insurgency of IBM PC clone-makers, enabling a new generation of PC manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Early Growth Engines

In its early years, Compaq's success was driven by several key strategies:

### Breakthrough Product
Compaq offered a product that was both compatible with and differentiated from the original IBM PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The Compaq Portable, while not a true laptop, could be transported and was cheaper than IBM's offerings, making it suitable as a second computer for working professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Compaq also ensured deep compatibility with IBM's business software ecosystem, including Lotus 1-2-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This required meticulous engineering, including using a cleanroom to re-implement the IBM PC BIOS code and adhering to IBM PC's hardware, down to the keyboard layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Speed and Agility
Compaq's product development cycle was significantly faster than IBM's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. While IBM's process took 12 to 18 months, Compaq completed development in just 6 to 9 months by having all departments work concurrently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This speed allowed them to bring new technologies to market faster, exemplified by the iconic Deskpro 386, which was the first IBM PC clone with leading-edge silicon, arriving a full year before IBM's comparable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Compaq also excelled at quickly filling shelves with products, offering a compelling alternative to IBM's frequent stock-outs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Distribution Strategy
A major engine of Compaq's growth was its exclusive relationship with dealers and retailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Unlike IBM, which also used its own sales force, Compaq relied solely on channels like Sears, BusinessLand, and ComputerLand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Cofounder Rod Canion's philosophy was "Keep the seller sold" and "A dealer done right can be the best distribution mechanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This approach saved money by avoiding a large sales force and fostered strong dealer loyalty, as retailers knew Compaq would not compete with them directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This early advantage contributed to Compaq's fabled growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Perceived Business Acumen

Compaq's early success garnered widespread admiration, with business media praising its ability to select the right products at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. A 1990 Harvard Business Review interview with Rod Canion highlighted Compaq's consensus-oriented culture and seemingly counterintuitive business style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>:
> "In an industry that is driven by innovation, Compaq defines innovation as staying within the boundaries of accepted industry standards ..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
> "...cost ranks relatively low on the list of manufacturing priorities." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>

## Challenges: The Rise of Commoditization

### "Attack of the Clones"
The modular nature of the IBM PC clone ecosystem, similar to Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), meant that components could be easily integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. By mid-1985, the ecosystem's quality improved to the point where assembling components was relatively straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This led to only two factors truly differentiating a computer's perceived performance: Microsoft's OS software and Intel's silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Compaq's Deskpro 386, while iconic, inspired a generation of competitors, particularly from the United States and East Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Companies like Dell and Gateway introduced "super-clones" that were just as powerful but significantly cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This price difference stemmed from cheaper materials, offshore labor, or different business models like direct selling (telephone or mail-order) which cut out dealer markups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Dell, for instance, ran advertising campaigns directly comparing its prices to Compaq's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Consumers consistently paid a 67% premium for a Compaq system compared to a similar Gateway 2000 system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Compaq was slow to acknowledge or respond to this price pressure, with President Michael Swavely stating in December 1990, "You can charge a premium price if you build the best machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### Innovation and R&D Investment
Despite being fast to integrate new technologies, Compaq produced few of those innovations themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. In the late 1980s, only about 4% of revenues were invested in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This left them beholden to critical partners like Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

Compaq also missed opportunities to enter and corner new markets. For example, in early 1984, Rod Canion wanted to develop a laptop, but market research showed a small market, leading him to set it aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. When Toshiba released the successful T3100 in 1986, indicating a market shift, Compaq didn't introduce its own laptop, the SLT, until October 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This suggested that Compaq, built to challenge IBM, was ill-equipped to keep pace with a rapidly changing business environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

### European Market Expansion
Despite intensifying competition and a lack of self-generated innovation, Compaq's revenues and profits continued to grow, largely due to its European operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Led by Eckhard Pfeiffer, these operations transplanted the dealer-only structure across Europe, igniting massive growth in a largely untapped market previously dominated by IBM, Apple, and Olivetti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. By 1990, over half of Compaq's revenues came from abroad, primarily Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Leadership Change and Turnaround (1991)

In mid-1990, a mini-recession caused by the First Gulf War led to lower company budgets and increased price-consciousness among consumers, accelerating the growth of clones and forcing Compaq to cut hardware prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Chairman Ben Rosen grew concerned about Compaq's ability to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

In May 1991, Compaq pre-announced an 81% drop in second-quarter profits, causing a 27% stock crash and $1.2 billion loss in market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Management, however, viewed these as "short-term perturbations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Rosen demanded headcount cuts and a low-end PC within three months, but Canion argued it would take a year and sacrifice quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. After a contentious board meeting where Rosen presented two demo PCs assembled in three days from off-the-shelf parts, Canion was fired in October 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Eckhard Pfeiffer was appointed CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

## Pfeiffer's "New Changes" and Turnaround

Pfeiffer, known for his intensity and execution skills, quickly unveiled a new strategy: focusing on volume by making millions of low-cost PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

Key actions included:
*   **Price War**: Launched a price war against Dell and Gateway, cutting prices across all Compaq products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   **New Low-Cost Products**: In June 1992, 16 new products were unveiled, including the low-cost ProLinea desktop and Contura laptop lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Development was fast-tracked by pitting internal component divisions against external suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. The cheapest 386 Compaq was 50% cheaper in 1992 than in 1991, and ProLinea became the best-selling line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   **Expanded Distribution**: Deals were signed with large computer superstores targeting home consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
*   **Increased R&D**: R&D spend increased to $173 million in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
*   **Strategic Partnerships**: Struck deals with system integrators like EDS to service large corporate clients, while maintaining reliance on PC distributors and retailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

Pfeiffer's strategies led to a remarkably fast turnaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. In 1992, Compaq sold 150% more computers than in 1991, with revenues reaching $4.1 billion (up 25%) and net profits $213 million (up 63%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. By 1993, revenues soared to $7 billion and profits to $867 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

In August 1993, Compaq introduced the Presario, an all-in-one computer for the home and home office, which became a massive hit and Compaq's new best-selling line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. By 1995, Compaq became the world's largest PC maker, leapfrogging IBM and Apple, with $14.9 billion in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. Pfeiffer transformed Compaq into a mass-market volume PC maker, selling at all price points and functionalities, from servers to sub-$1000 laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

## Challenges and Diversification Attempts

After 1995, competition intensified, especially from Dell, whose direct-selling model began eating into Compaq's market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Compaq's persistent reliance on external distributors and retailers became a liability, as adopting a direct-selling model would alienate its existing partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. Margins fell to a razor-thin 20% by 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>.

Pfeiffer believed Compaq's future lay in expanding beyond mere PCs to become a global computer company offering services, aiming for $50 billion in revenue by 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. This vision led to a series of problematic acquisitions:
*   **Networth (late 1995)** and **Microcom (May 1997)**: To build a networking business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.
*   **Tandem Computer Incorporated (June 1997)**: Acquired for $4 billion, specializing in fault-tolerant computers for 24/7 service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) (January 1998)**: A record $9.6 billion acquisition, making Compaq a $38 billion giant with DEC's $13 billion in revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. DEC's expertise in minicomputers, R&D prowess, and services business were seen as upsides, despite its struggles to adapt to competition from cheaper Unix computers like those from [[Sun Microsystems business model and strategy | Sun Microsystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. DEC also owned AltaVista, a major search engine, but Compaq did little with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

Pfeiffer struggled to integrate these acquisitions and capitalize on DEC's considerable technical assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. It was not until 1998 that Compaq began adopting Dell's direct-sales model, but it was "too little, too late" to close Dell's cost advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

## End of Compaq

In April 1999, Ben Rosen and the board fired Pfeiffer, citing his focus on revenue numbers, expensive acquisitions, and inability to integrate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. Michael Capellas, an insider, was chosen as the new CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. While expenses fell and margins improved, the core PC business continued to deteriorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. In September 1999, Dell overtook Compaq as the leading PC seller in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.

## Merger with Hewlett-Packard

In 2000, Hewlett-Packard (HP) sought to remake itself, looking for new profitable growth beyond its commoditized PC business, possibly in Internet services, similar to IBM's turnaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. Carly Fiorina, HP's new CEO, sought to transform HP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

In mid-2000, Capellas and Fiorina discussed a merger, culminating in HP's acquisition of Compaq on September 3, 2001, for about $25 billion in a stock swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. This [[Merger with Hewlett Packard | merger with Hewlett Packard]] created an $87 billion company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

The acquisition was met with skepticism due to concerns about integrating two struggling companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Despite the chaos and internal battles, the merger ultimately proved beneficial for shareholders under Fiorina's successor, Mark Hurd, who cut costs and grew the combined company to over $110 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>. The Compaq brand was phased out by HP, with remnants remaining on some low-end computers until 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.

Compaq's role in leading the fight against IBM is often forgotten, overshadowed by the massive commoditization of the PC industry in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

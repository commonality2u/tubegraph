[[Computational Lithography and CuLitho | Inverse Lithography Technology]] (ILT) is a [[History and evolution of lithography technology | Resolution Enhancement Technique]] (RET) aimed at improving the resolution of chip design image transfer during the [[History and evolution of lithography technology | lithography]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. It offers a different approach compared to traditional [[Computational Lithography and CuLitho | Optical Proximity Correction]] (OPC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## How ILT Works

Unlike traditional OPC, which starts with a design and makes changes to the mask based on model simulations to achieve a desired pattern on the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, ILT conceptually works in reverse: from the wafer back to the mask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

The process involves:
*   **Defining the desired pattern**: Knowing the exact pattern intended for the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Calculating the optimal mask**: Determining the best mask design to achieve that pattern, considering how light travels through the [[History and evolution of lithography technology | lithography]] machine and interacts with the resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Pixel-by-pixel mask generation**: ILT then creates the entire mask from scratch, pixel by pixel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This "inverse" approach, starting with the destination and working backwards, is its key differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Early implementations by Professor B.E.A. Saleh used a variant of "simulated annealing," an optimization technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This involved creating a randomly generated mask, making random changes by "flipping pixels," and keeping what improved results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## History and Development

*   **Early Concepts (1981)**: Professor B.E.A. Saleh of the University of Wisconsin-Madison first proposed the concepts of what would become [[Computational Lithography and CuLitho | Inverse Lithography Technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Refinement**: Researchers at Berkeley, IBM, and other organizations refined the technique, experimenting with different methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Luminescent Technologies (2003)**: A startup called Luminescent Technologies made a significant impact with their paper "Fast [[Computational Lithography and CuLitho | Inverse Lithography Technology]]", giving ILT its current name and pushing it across the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Intel's Version (2007)**: Intel, which had been funding academic research in the field since the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, presented their own version, calling it "pixelated mask technology" to avoid the ILT name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

The masks generated by ILT are often "very unintuitive, like some sort of horrific mutation of the original design," but the results are highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Advantages of ILT

From a pure results perspective, ILT typically outperforms model-based OPC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. ILT-generated masks tend to be:
*   More accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>
*   Have greater fidelity to the desired pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>
*   Offer more room for process error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>

## Challenges and Bottlenecks

Despite its advantages, ILT faced substantial tradeoffs:
*   **Computational Power and Throughput**: Accounting for every pixel to produce an optimal solution requires immense computing power or time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Some designs could take weeks to process, which was unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Mask Manufacturing**: Photomasks are "written" using focused electron beams, a slow but precise process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Traditional masks use "Manhattan geometry" (shapes made of rectangles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. ILT-generated masks, however, often have "curvilinear" shapes with complicated curves and diagonals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Producing these required "fracturing" complex shapes into rectangles, which was challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Competition**: In the late 2000s and early 2010s, [[Technological advances in lithography tools by ASML | 193 nanometer immersion lithography]] significantly improved resolutions, reducing the immediate need for ILT over OPS for semiconductor manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

These issues of manufacturability, computation, and competition proved game-breaking for companies like Luminescent Technologies, which was later split up and acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. ILT was considered "a bit too early for its time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## Changing Times and Resurgence

Over time, advancements have addressed ILT's historical challenges:
*   **Mask Writing Tools**: New multi-beam tools, such as those from Austria-based IMS, now enable the production of complex curvilinear masks in a reasonable timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
*   **Increasing Chip Complexity**: Today's leading-edge chips, like Hopper with 80 billion transistors, contain trillions of polygons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. These ever-increasing demands have compelled fabs to use ILT more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
*   **Acceleration with GPUs**: TSMC presented simulation results demonstrating how GPUs could significantly speed up ILT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Nvidia took on the challenge to turn these simulations into reality, resulting in the development of [[Computational Lithography and CuLitho | CuLitho]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

## ILT and [[Computational Lithography and CuLitho | CuLitho]]

[[Computational Lithography and CuLitho | CuLitho]] is a software library announced by Nvidia in March 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It is designed to accelerate computational [[History and evolution of lithography technology | lithography]] processes, including ILT, by leveraging GPUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Nvidia claims [[Computational Lithography and CuLitho | CuLitho]] can deliver a performance leap of up to 40x beyond current [[Computational Lithography and CuLitho | lithography]] capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This acceleration helps address the computational bottlenecks that previously hindered widespread ILT adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

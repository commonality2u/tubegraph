In 1995, over 30 companies were actively competing to develop the leading graphics chips for personal computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Within six years, this number dwindled to just three, with [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] emerging as the clear leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article explores the early competition and the strategic moves that led to this market consolidation.

## Origins of Graphics Hardware

The concept of dedicated hardware for complex 3D graphics processing predates [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s emergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Atari video game consoles in the 1970s already incorporated graphics chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The first commercial video cards, designed to be plugged into the main computer, appeared in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

An early example was the IBM Professional Graphics Controller (PGA), released in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. It utilized an onboard Intel 8088 microprocessor for video tasks, freeing up the computer's CPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. However, its high cost ($4,000-$5,000) and IBM PC exclusivity limited its market success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

In the late 1980s, Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) became a dominant force in the graphics market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. SGI refined the "graphics pipeline" concept, which translates 3D coordinates into 2D pixel space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. In 1992, SGI released OpenGL, a public 3D graphics standard (API) with 120 commands for drawing points, lines, and polygons, which became widely adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. While SGI hardware dominated the workstation space, they did not seriously pursue the consumer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## The Catalyst: 3D Gaming Boom

Consumer interest in graphics significantly accelerated in 1990 with the release of Windows 3.1, which featured a graphical user interface (GUI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Over 2 million units were sold in its first six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The true turning point for consumer graphics was the release of the 3D game *Doom* by id Software in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Unlike "Nintendo-ish childish toys," *Doom* offered a mature, action-packed first-person shooter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Its successor, *Quake*, released in 1996, introduced full real-time 3D rendering and online multiplayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

However, many PC owners found their computers struggled to run *Quake* at full specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. John Carmack, *Quake*'s main programmer, initially worked with chip designer Rendition, but ultimately rewrote the game to support OpenGL, creating "GLQuake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This spurred a wave of innovation in the consumer video card space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## 3dfx's Brief Dominance

One of the first companies to capitalize on the demand for 3D gaming was 3dfx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. They developed a wrapper program to make OpenGL compatible with their proprietary Glide graphics API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Exploiting a drop in RAM prices, they launched the Voodoo video card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

The Voodoo card, with chips designed by 3dfx in America, manufactured in Taiwan, and sold to board partners, was the first consumer card capable of running GLQuake very well (640x480 at 30 frames per second in 16-bit color) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Crucially, it retailed for about $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Its main limitation was that it only offered 3D acceleration, requiring a separate card for 2D graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Despite this, it sold exceptionally well, and at its peak, 3dfx held 80% of the 3D acceleration graphics card market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Nvidia's Ascent: Strategic Pivots

[[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, with Huang as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Their goal was to create microprocessors for high-quality 3D graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Early on, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] faced challenges, being one of many graphics chip startups during a Silicon Valley downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. They secured $2.5 million in funding and established key partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>:
*   **Manufacturing**: Partnered with SGS-Thomson Microelectronics (now ST Microelectronics) in 1994 for chip manufacturing, while [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] focused on design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Distribution**: Partnered with Diamond Multimedia Systems to integrate [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s chips into their accelerator boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Branding/Content**: Collaborated with Sega to port their arcade games to PCs, allowing [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] to use Sega's brand name for launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### The NV1 Flop and Strategic Reassessment

[[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s first product, the NV1, launched in May 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. It was an ambitious multimedia PCI card that combined graphics, sound, and Sega gamepad support, aiming to be the "Sound Blaster of multimedia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. However, it tried to do too much, resulting in compromises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Crucially, the NV1 was incompatible with leading graphics APIs like OpenGL and 3dfx's Glide, and these companies weren't interested in collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The NV1 flopped, and [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] stopped selling it in late 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

Following this setback, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s leadership, inspired by Samsung's "change everything" mantra, made three critical strategic bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>:

1.  **Betting on Microsoft Direct3D**: Microsoft quickly noticed the trend of 3D PC games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. In 1996, they acquired RenderMorphics and created Direct3D, part of the DirectX bundle, touting it as the best way for game developers to make games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Despite initial criticism from figures like John Carmack, Microsoft promised improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] gambled that Direct3D's integration with Windows would make it the dominant API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
2.  **Vertical Integration of Device Drivers**: Traditionally, board partners wrote device drivers, leading to mismatched incentives and poor quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] decided to write their own drivers in-house, aligning incentives and allowing them to create high-performing drivers by aggregating feedback from all board partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This became a cornerstone of their future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
3.  **Outsourced Manufacturing and Moore's Law**: [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] ended its partnership with SGS-Thomson in 1998 due to conflicting interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. They struck a new partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a rising power that pledged never to compete with its partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. This allowed [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] to focus entirely on chip design, leveraging TSMC's manufacturing prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] became one of TSMC's biggest customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

### The RIVA 128's Success

With these pivots, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] launched its second major product, the RIVA 128, in 1997, with less than six weeks of cash remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. The RIVA 128 was designed to accelerate Direct3D and, critically, supported both 3D and 2D graphicsâ€”a feature 3dfx's Voodoo cards lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. It sold well, retailing for about $140, and Diamond Multimedia resold it as the Diamond Viper 330 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

[[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] organized its design teams for rapid iteration, with groups working on current, refreshed, and future designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. They adopted advanced chip design processes, including computer-aided design verification and validation, to prevent costly bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. This led to a relentless six-month product cycle, grinding down competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

## Competitors' Missteps and Market Consolidation

While [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] accelerated, its main competitors faltered.

### The Decline of 3dfx

3dfx held the market lead with Voodoo graphics in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. However, their struggle to develop a proper 3D/2D follow-up (like the underperforming Rush chipset in 1997, and the delayed Banshee in 1998) allowed [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] and ATI to gain a foothold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

The company's fatal error came in December 1998 when 3dfx acquired boardmaker STB for $141 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. They announced that their chips would only be available in their own brand-named boards, directly competing with their former customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. This alienated old partners who defected to [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. 3dfx lacked manufacturing experience, and STB's facilities couldn't compete with Asian manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. The manufacturing division became a cash drain, and 3dfx dissolved, selling its assets to [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

### Intel's Failed Bid for High-End Graphics

In 1996, Intel, the industry's "800-pound gorilla," declared that 80% of PCs would have 3D graphics by the millennium and that they would dominate the space by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. This even prompted Microsoft to cancel its own line of graphics hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

Intel released the Intel 740 card in 1998, but it did not sell well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. It used the AGP port, which Intel was trying to popularize, while most of the market stuck with the PCI standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. The card performed poorly in real-world use despite good speed tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. Intel, accustomed to slower CPU development cycles, could not keep up with the rapid pace of the graphics market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. The I-740 was quickly discontinued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

Intel pivoted to integrated graphics processors (IGPs), which use a portion of system memory rather than dedicated VRAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. Leveraging its CPU monopoly, Intel built massive market share in this space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. While not high-end, Intel's IGPs were "good enough" for most low-end users, effectively wiping out the market for low-margin, low-performance discrete graphics cards and causing many smaller companies to shrivel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

## The New Landscape

By the early 2000s, the graphics card market had consolidated from over 30 companies to just three: [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]], ATI (a duopoly in the high-end), and Intel (dominating the low-end) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. ATI was acquired by AMD in 2006 for $5.6 billion and subsequently rebranded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. Today, AMD's graphics cards sell well and are common in game consoles, but [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] retains its leading position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

[[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s success is often attributed to its strategic vertical integration in areas like device drivers, which provided a lasting competitive edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. In contrast, 3dfx's vertical integration into manufacturing proved disastrous, destroying value, burning cash, and alienating customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.

Since 1999, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] has expanded its vision beyond just gaming graphics, coining the phrase "General Processing Unit" (GPU) and popularizing the concept of general-purpose computing for applications beyond video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

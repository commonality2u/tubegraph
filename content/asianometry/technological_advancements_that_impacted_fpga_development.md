A **Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)** is an integrated circuit that can be reprogrammed after manufacture to emulate a digital circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. FPGAs are valuable for prototyping new functionalities before mass production or for serving rare use cases that are not economical for a custom chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While not the first devices with this capability, FPGAs have achieved the most commercial success in the realm of reprogrammable chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

[[history_of_fpgas_and_their_development | The history of FPGAs]] is rooted in a decades-long quest to create chips that could be reprogrammed after manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Early Challenges in Chip Design
Before the advent of FPGAs, engineers had limited options for prototyping logic functions on hardware:
*   **TTL Chips**: These involved plugging transistors into a printed circuit board, but were limited by board size and power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Custom-Built Chips (ASICs)**: Getting a chip built to order, known today as an [[history_of_chip_design_and_evolution_of_electronic_design_automation | Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)]], incurred substantial upfront costs for photo masks and months of fabrication time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Mistakes in design were very costly, as editing was not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This path was generally not economically viable unless the use case was very large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

As [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | integrated circuits]] became more widely adopted after the 1960s, the need for field programmability grew more compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### [[comparison_between_fpgas_and_other_programmable_devices_like_proms_and_plas | Predecessors to FPGAs]]

#### Programmable Read-Only Memories (PROMs)
The first [[comparison_between_fpgas_and_other_programmable_devices_like_proms_and_plas | integrated circuits capable of implementing a programmable logic function]] were Programmable Read-Only Memories (PROMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Harris Semiconductor's Innovation (1970)**: Harris Semiconductor introduced PROMs that could be programmed to implement an array of programmable logic gates, specifically an AND set and an OR set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This supported combinational (time-independent) logic functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Fusible Metal Links**: Harris's PROMs had fixed AND gates and programmable OR gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Programmability was achieved using fusible metal links made of nichrome, which users programmed by burning the switches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This made them one-time use only and challenging to program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Harris also pioneered fabrication of these burnable fuses by creating and blowing test fuses on the wafer during the test process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Efficiency Issues**: Using PROMs for programmable logic was inefficient because they required many memory cells that were not needed for the logic function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

#### Programmable Logic Arrays (PLAs)
*   **Signetics' PLA (1975)**: Signetics (later part of NXP Semiconductors) introduced the Programmable Logic Array (PLA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. With the PLA, both the AND set and OR set of logic gates were made programmable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This offered a wider range of logic functions but at a significant cost due to the larger chip size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. A PLA part cost about $25 in 1975, equivalent to about $140 today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Like PROMs, PLAs were programmed by burning fuse connections, making errors costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Despite their advantages, PLAs did not gain widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

#### Programmable Array Logic (PALs)
*   **Monolithic Memories' PAL (1977)**: John Birkner and H.D. Tua of Monolithic Memories modified the PLA to create the Programmable Array Logic (PAL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. PALs traded some configurability for better performance and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. They kept the programmable AND set but made the OR set of logic gates fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Inclusion of Sequential Logic**: A key advancement in PAL design was the inclusion of sequential logic circuits using macrocells, such as flip-flops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Flip-flops could store a single bit of information, allowing for functions like rolling sums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This addition made PALs more practical for everyday consumer usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Reprogrammable Technology**: In the early 1980s, new technologies emerged to make these circuits truly reprogrammable, such as flashing ultraviolet light through a window to erase them, eliminating the need for fuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

PALs achieved some success and were widely manufactured, partly because memory makers found them similar enough to their core products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

#### Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs)
*   **Altera's EP300 (1984)**: In 1980, engineers from Intel, Signetics, and Intersil founded Altera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Their first product, the EP300, released in July 1984, was a simple programmable logic device made with a CMOS EEPROM process, making it erasable and programmable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Scalability Issue with PALs**: A major problem with PALs was that their structure did not scale well with [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | Moore's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. As the AND set of gates grew larger, it became slower because the number of transistors grew faster than the inputs and outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Altera's CPLD**: To overcome this, Altera pioneered the Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This involved connecting multiple smaller PALs with crossbar connections, enabling much greater scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **CMOS Adoption**: Altera's choice to use [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | CMOS technology]] was also impactful, requiring them to source it from Ricoh in Japan as it was not available in the United States at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Altera's success marked the beginning of the fabless design model that now drives the American semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### The First FPGA: Xilinx XC2064
*   **Xilinx's Vision (Mid-1980s)**: Ross Freeman, an engineer at Zilog, envisioned that with continued [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | Moore's Law]], transistors would become cheap enough to create a single piece of silicon that could meet diverse needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. He founded Xilinx in February 1984 to realize this vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Collaboration with Seiko**: Xilinx partnered with Seiko Corporation to produce their new chip, offering Seiko a way to keep their fabs busy and granting them exclusive resale rights in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Design Challenges**: Designer Bill Carter faced immense challenges, with guidance limited to Freeman's loose patent application and no prior experience with Seiko's 2.5-micrometer [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | CMOS process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. The chip was also exceptionally large for its time, raising concerns about yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Architecture of the XC2064**: The Xilinx XC2064, the first FPGA, elegantly addressed the PAL's scalability issue by removing the AND gate set entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Instead, it featured:
    *   An array of **configurable logic blocks (CLBs)** connected by programmable switches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
    *   Device inputs and outputs placed around the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
    *   Each CLB contained a pair of **lookup tables**, which map outputs to inputs, allowing FPGAs to implement arbitrary logic functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
    *   Programmable interconnects between logic blocks, enabling arbitrary signal paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Early Programming**: The first Xilinx FPGAs required external memory to store programming when power was off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. A few years later, Actel invented **anti-fuse technology** to address this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Initial Challenges**: The XC2064 was a large chip, with 85,000 transistors arranged into 64 CLBs and 58 I/O blocks, translating to less than a thousand gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Its size strained Seiko's manufacturing capabilities, resulting in extremely low yields (only one working wafer out of 25 in the first batch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This led to high costs, with initial FPGAs costing hundreds of dollars, compared to cheaper PALs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. FPGAs were also harder to use due to their newness and complicated [[history_of_chip_design_and_evolution_of_electronic_design_automation | Electronic Design Automation (EDA)]] software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

### Key Technological Enablers for FPGA Success

Despite their early disadvantages, FPGAs thrived due to several technological advancements:
*   **[[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | Moore's Law]] and Classical Scaling**: The launch of FPGAs coincided with the rapid advancement of lithography technologies, which accelerated classical scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Since FPGAs were designed to scale while PALs were not, they were in prime position to benefit from crashing transistor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP)**: This new process significantly lowered the costs of making the complex interconnects necessary for FPGAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. CMP enabled FPGAs to exponentially increase their lookup table counts and interconnect wire lengths, making them faster and more powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Rise of Independent Foundries**: The early 1990s saw the emergence of independent foundries, which allowed companies like Altera and Xilinx to pioneer the fabless startup model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This meant design teams could focus on innovation without needing expertise in semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Foundries, in turn, found that FPGAs with their large dies were excellent for honing and mastering their processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. This led to a blossoming [[market_evolution_and_emergence_of_fpga_companies | FPGA market]] with many new startups, whose innovations were often absorbed by Xilinx and Altera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **Proprietary EDA Software**: Unlike PAL manufacturers, who relied on third-party EDA software and were thus limited by their capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, FPGA companies controlled their own EDA tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. This allowed them to dictate their future, crafting software to enable more features and adding automation for increased productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

Today, FPGAs are widely used across various industries, filling a valuable gap as ASICs become increasingly expensive to design and fabricate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. They continue to gain new functionalities, expanding into areas like AI processing and data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, showcasing their unique "Swiss army knife" functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

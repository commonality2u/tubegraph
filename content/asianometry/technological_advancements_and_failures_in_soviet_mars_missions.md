From 1960 to 1973, the [[soviet_mars_missions_from_1960_to_1973 | Soviet Union]] launched 15 probes and orbiters to Mars in a fierce [[competition_between_soviet_union_and_united_states_in_space_exploration | competition with the United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While the Soviets achieved significant success with their [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera missions to Venus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, they struggled to replicate this success on Mars, losing key milestones such as the race to fly by, orbit, and safely land on the Martian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Early Ambitions and Initial Setbacks (1950s-1960s)

After Stalin's death, the political climate loosened, allowing Sergey Korolev, chief designer of the Soviet space program, to pursue his dream of space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. Korolev, who had reverse-engineered German V2 rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>, envisioned using the R7 missile not for military purposes, but to reach the Moon, Venus, and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. The launch of Sputnik in 1957 created an unexpected sensation globally, leading the Soviets to propose a vast program to send robot spacecraft to Mars and Venus, eventually aiming for human missions and colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

### The 1M Project (1960)

The first Mars mission window was set for 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This required significant technological leaps, including developing a new, more powerful four-stage R7 rocket (the 8K78 or Molniya) to achieve the necessary interplanetary speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

However, the rapid development under intense political pressure led to significant [[challenges_faced_in_soviet_space_program | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>:
*   **Rushed Development:** Factories produced faulty components, and probes arrived in pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.
*   **Integration Issues:** The radio system for landers interfered with television cameras, and instruments had to be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
*   **Rocket Failures:**
    *   **October 10, 1960:** The first 1M rocket suffered heavy vibrations, breaking up over Eastern Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.
    *   **Second Probe:** The rocket's third stage failed due to a frozen kerosene leak, causing it to break up in the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
    
These failures occurred even before the newly built fourth stages could be tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. The failures were so severe that models of the Mars craft, intended as a bragging gift for US President Eisenhower, were never given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

### The 2MV Project (1962) and Zond Series (1964)

Reliability issues continued to plague the Molniya rocket, especially with its lower manufacturing stages and the critical fourth stage, which had to launch in zero gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. Despite these challenges, the Soviets built six 2MV probes, three for the 1962 Mars launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

*   **Sputnik 22 (2MV-4 number one):** Launched during the Cuban Missile Crisis, it failed in Earth orbit due to the troublesome fourth stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. The launch almost triggered a nuclear alert in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.
*   **Mars 1 (2MV number four / Sputnik 23):** Launched November 1, 1962, it initially performed well, but a gas engine leak in the orientation system led to loss of contact on March 21, 1963, before reaching Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.
*   **Zond 2 (1964):** Intended for Mars, it suffered fatal onboard failures, including a failed solar panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.

The [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | Americans achieved a significant milestone]] with Mariner 4, which launched around the same time as Zond 2 and successfully flew by Mars in July 1965, sending back 22 photographs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. This drastically dampened dreams of sophisticated Martian life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.

Korolev's focus shifted to the Moon race due to political pressure, and the planetary program was reassigned to a new firm, Lavochkin, in March 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. Korolev himself passed away in January 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.

## Reboot and Continued Struggles (Late 1960s - Early 1970s)

Mariner 4's success prompted Lavochkin to completely reboot the Soviet Mars program in October 1965, realizing simply replicating Mariner 4 would not be enough. They aimed for soft landings and searching for microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>. This decision meant missing the 1967 launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.

### The M69 Project (1969)

The new m69 project utilized the more powerful UR-500 (Proton) rocket, originally developed as a super-large ICBM, capable of sending significant payload into interplanetary space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>.

However, the m69 project faced intense challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>:
*   **Design Issues:** Early designs adapted from lunar probes had fundamental propulsion system issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>. Georgiy Babakin, the engineering head, made the risky decision to scrap the design and restart just 13 months before launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.
*   **On-board Computer:** The m69 was the first Soviet planetary device with an on-board computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>, but planned entry probes and landers were removed due to weight and testing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>.
*   **Complex Launch Sequence:** The mission involved an unprecedented three-stage Proton launch into Earth orbit, followed by a fourth stage firing and then the probe's own engine firing multiple times for trajectory adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>.
*   **[[impact_of_political_pressure_on_soviet_space_missions | Immense Political Pressure]]:** The Communist Party demanded the 1969 launch date be met, issuing a military-industrial resolution. Teams worked around the clock with no overtime pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>.

Despite these efforts, both m69 probes failed due to rocket issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>:
*   **M69a (March 27, 1969):** Exploded due to a rotor failure and pump issue in the third stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:22:00">[20:22:00]</a>.
*   **M69b (April 2, 1969):** The first stage engine failed at launch, causing the rocket to fall back and explode, spewing toxic materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>.

These failures, coupled with the successful Apollo 11 Moon landing in July 1969 and Mariner 6 and 7 flybys of Mars, were a bitter defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>.

### The 1971 Missions (Mars 2 and 3)

The m69 failures meant engineers lacked crucial atmospheric data for a soft landing on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:23:00">[22:23:00]</a>. For the special 1971 launch window, the Soviets decided on three probes: an orbiter (m71s) to gather data, and two landers (m71p) that would use that data for entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>.

Technological approaches included:
*   **Uncontrolled Ballistic Entry:** Lacking American data, the Soviets opted for a "bullet punching through the sky" approach, determined entirely by gravity and atmospheric drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>.
*   **Parachute Testing:** Models were dropped from high altitudes and accelerated to Mach 3.5 using gunpowder engines for parachute deployment tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:04:00">[26:04:00]</a>.
*   **Soft Landing System:** Involved a radio altimeter and soft landing engine firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:34:00">[26:34:00]</a>.
*   **Impact Testing:** Five models were catapulted onto simulated Martian ground to test survivability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:47:00">[27:47:00]</a>.
*   **Prop-M Marsokhod:** A small, ski-walking rover designed to measure ground density and interact with the soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>.

Despite these advancements:
*   **M71s Failure (May 9, 1971):** A "gross and unforgivable mistake" by an operator coding the sequence led to the rocket's fourth stage firing at 150 hours instead of 1.5 hours, dooming the orbiter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:59:00">[28:59:00]</a>. This meant the landers would still lack crucial atmospheric data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:46:00">[29:46:00]</a>.
*   **Mars 2 (November 27, 1971):** The lander's computer program misinterpreted data, causing it to enter the atmosphere at the wrong angle and crash before the parachute deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:28:00">[31:28:00]</a>. It was, however, the first Earth-made object to reach the Martian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>.
*   **Mars 3 (December 2, 1971):** The landing sequence worked, and the lander transmitted for 14.5 seconds before the television camera system failed, possibly due to electric discharges from a dust storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:04:00">[32:04:00]</a>. No clear image was sent back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:55:00">[32:55:00]</a>.

## The All-Out Assault of 1973

For the 1973 window, the Soviets planned an "all-out assault" on Mars with two orbiters (Mars 4, 5) and two landers (Mars 6, 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:50:00">[34:50:00]</a>. These adopted similar designs to Mars 2 and 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:00">[35:35:00]</a>.

However, a critical [[innovation_and_industrial_challenges_in_soviet_computer_industry | industrial challenge]] emerged:
*   **Faulty Transistors:** Near the end of the integration phase, tests revealed repeated failures in the 2T312 transistors, extensively used across all four spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:03:00">[36:03:00]</a>. These transistors, specified to have gold leads, were fabricated with aluminum leads instead, leading to high failure rates due to corrosion after 1.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:18:00">[36:18:00]</a>. The ministry decided to proceed with launch due to political pressure and the looming 1975 Viking mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:12:00">[37:12:00]</a>.

The engineers' fears proved correct:
*   **Mars 4 (Orbiter):** Flew by Mars on February 10, 1974, without entering orbit due to a failure in its disproportion brake system, likely related to faulty transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>. It took some photos before entering solar orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:49:00">[37:49:00]</a>.
*   **Mars 7 (Lander):** Reached Mars on March 9 and released its lander, but transistor failures in the lander's computer systems caused it to miss the planet by 1,300 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:01:00">[38:01:00]</a>.
*   **Mars 5 (Orbiter):** Successfully entered Martian orbit in February 1974, but a slow pressure leak forced ground control to accelerate its three-month science program to just three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:17:00">[38:17:00]</a>. It took 108 high-resolution images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:37:00">[38:37:00]</a>.
*   **Mars 6 (Lander):** Lost telemetry data two months after launch, meaning ground control could only send commands without knowing its status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:04:00">[39:04:00]</a>. Remarkably, it autonomously measured its position, calculated a trajectory, entered Mars orbit, and released its entry probe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:24:00">[39:24:00]</a>. However, the lander failed to land safely, with transmission cutting off upon approach to the surface, likely due to a failed final landing rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:51:00">[39:51:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite some scientific gains, the 1973 missions were largely considered a failure by leadership. The program's chief designer, Vasili Mishin, was dismissed, and Valentin Glushko, his rival, pivoted the Soviet space program towards a space shuttle (Buran) and its launcher (Energia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:27:00">[40:27:00]</a>. This meant fewer resources for planetary exploration, leading to a focus on Venus, where the Soviets had a clear advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:51:00">[40:51:00]</a>.

A final "last gasp" launch to the Martian moon Phobos occurred in 1989, as the [[challenges_faced_in_soviet_space_program | Soviet Union stumbled]] towards its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:33:00">[41:33:00]</a>:
*   **Phobos 1:** Failed to enter Mars orbit due to a faulty command and computer logic error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:00">[41:41:00]</a>.
*   **Phobos 2:** Arrived and took pictures of Phobos but a malfunctioning computer prevented the release of its lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:49:00">[41:49:00]</a>.

The [[soviet_mars_missions_from_1960_to_1973 | Soviet Mars program]] was defined by its [[competition_between_soviet_union_and_united_states_in_space_exploration | competition with the United States]], granting it substantial resources but also imposing arduous [[impact_of_political_pressure_on_soviet_space_missions | political requirements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:58:00">[41:58:00]</a>. Poor execution, limited launch windows, and plain bad luck foiled their success on Mars, with achievements far eclipsed by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:15:00">[42:15:00]</a>. Nevertheless, the ambition to send 15 robots millions of kilometers to another planet remains a testament to incredible efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:28:00">[42:28:00]</a>.

Upon gaining independence in December 1949, Indonesia entered a difficult period under its first president, Sukarno <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. His government implemented a series of [[New Economic Policy and reversal of monetary policies | New Economic policies]] aimed at indigenizing foreign businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, and in 1958, seized all Dutch assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Sukarno's anti-imperialist ideologies led him closer to the Communists, and his focus on revolution neglected the economy, leading to hyperinflation by the mid-1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

## Suharto's Rise and the New Order
In 1965, an attempted coup and subsequent counter-coup led by Suharto resulted in mass killings of suspected Communists and other leftists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

> An "amazing documentary film" titled *The Act of Killing* invited former members of the death squads involved in the 1965-1966 killings to reenact their experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

In March 1966, Sukarno transferred power to Suharto, who declared a "new order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. This marked a complete reversal of the country's internal and external policies, including ending its war with Malaysia, dissolving alliances with Communist China, and rejoining the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

### Economic Reforms
Suharto's government faced the challenge of reforming an economy suffering from hyperinflation and insufficient revenue after its period of revolutionary communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. Indonesia possessed a large population, a cheap and willing labor force, and abundant natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. The country rebuilt its tax base and opened itself to foreign capital and aid, inviting foreigners to establish light manufacturing facilities for products like shoes and textiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. This development plan proved successful, leading to consistent economic growth throughout Suharto's reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

## [[Crony capitalism in Indonesia | Crony Capitalism]] and the Military-Business Nexus
The new economic growth under Suharto unfortunately created new opportunities for corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. Close and corrupt ties between the military and business community predated Suharto, stemming from the 1950s when military commanders partnered with local businessmen (known as *kukong*, Hokkien for "Boss") to raise funds, receiving favors in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. After independence, the military became involved in providing daily services, expanding their reach into sectors like shipping, hotels, and timber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

Suharto formalized this system, crafting a [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | crony capitalist political pyramid]] that collected "rents" from a wide range of economic activities, flowing upwards to himself and his elite circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. The government partnered with economic cronies in the private sector to achieve government goals, granting them preferential benefits and allowing them to generate profits for redistribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. Suharto strategically separated economic and political power, ensuring his Chinese business partners relied on him for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

### The Rise of Salim Group
Lim Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim), a close friend of Suharto since the Indonesian Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, became Suharto's "go-to guy for all money matters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. Lim rose from being one of Suharto's Chinese *kukong* to the biggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

*   **Clove Monopoly**: In 1966, Lim's company was granted one of two exclusive licenses to import cloves, a critical ingredient for Indonesia's *kretek* cigarettes. While Lim received a small percentage, the majority of profits went to a slush fund owned by Suharto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. This provided early funds for Lim's expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.
*   **Flour Milling (Bogasari/Indofood)**: After the U.S. sent wheat aid to Indonesia in 1967, which rapidly gained popularity, Lim partnered with Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok to open flour mills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. Founded in 1969, Bogasari Flour Mills received a monopoly for wheat import, milling, and distribution in Western Indonesia, covering 80% of the country's population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. This was immensely profitable, with 25-35% profit margins, and 26% of profits designated to foundations headed by Suharto and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. Salim Group's food business later became Indofood, a multi-billion dollar conglomerate and one of the world's biggest instant noodle producers, controlling 90% of the Indonesian market in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.
*   **Cement (Indocement)**: Following Indonesia's first five-year development plan (Repelita) to build domestic cement capacity, Suharto directed Lim to enter the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. With help from Taiwan's Tuntex Group, Salim built a massive cement complex. The oil export boom of the 1970s fueled demand for construction, allowing Lim to build one of the world's largest cement companies, controlling 60% of Indonesia's total cement production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. When oil prices tumbled in 1984, Suharto bailed out Lim's cement business by ordering the government to purchase 35% of PT Indocement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.
*   **Banking (BCA)**: Lim had acquired a small knitting company with a banking license in the 1950s, which he renamed Bank Central Asia (BCA) and moved to Jakarta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>. In 1975, he recruited banking expert Mukhtar Riady, who rapidly expanded BCA by attracting customers from Lim's other businesses, overhauling systems, introducing credit cards, and installing ATMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. In just three years, Riady made BCA Indonesia's biggest private bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.

By the end of the 1970s, Salim Group had grown from three companies in 1957 to 54 companies across six fields: trading, automobile manufacturing, property, construction, finance, and natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. By 1986, it had over 225 affiliated businesses, and by 1989, estimates were over 350 companies, many of which were monopolies or near-monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>. Examples include Indomobile Group, one of Indonesia's biggest car manufacturers, and Indomaret, Indonesia's largest convenience store chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

## Economic Challenges and Later Reforms
The oil export boom that fueled Indonesia's growth in the 1970s ended in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>. In response, the government passed reforms to ease import and export, including cutting red tape, lowering tariffs, and reforming the sales tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. These initially helped shift the economy away from oil and gas revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>.

However, in 1994, non-oil exports sputtered as investors, particularly from Japan, pivoted towards China, which was experiencing rapid economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:58:00">[18:58:00]</a>. The Indonesian government responded with more reforms, removing limits on foreign investment and opening new sectors, though protections remained for those dominated by Suharto's children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>. This seemed to work, with foreign investment rebounding and GDP growing around 8% annually in the following years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>.

During this period, the Salim Group saw its greatest expansion, with investments, partnerships, and acquisitions across Asia, growing at 40-50% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:00">[19:48:00]</a>. By 1996, independent analysts estimated Salim Group's total revenues at $22.8 billion, constituting 4% of Indonesia's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>. By 1997, Lim's net worth reached $4 billion, making him the world's 68th richest man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>.

### Suharto's Declining Grip and Family Corruption
As Suharto entered his 70s, he became increasingly out of touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>. His grown children began flexing their political muscles, replacing trusted advisors with their own incompetence and self-interest, which turned public opinion against the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. An infamous example was the 1990 creation of a single clove monopoly for his youngest son, Tommy, who mismanaged the industry so badly that Bank Indonesia had to contribute $350 million to bail it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.

Sensing a change, Lim Sioe Liong began diversifying his businesses offshore through First Pacific, a financial services company founded in Hong Kong in 1981, making investments in real estate and consumer businesses that no longer relied on his political ties to Suharto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

## [[Impact of Asian financial crisis on Indonesian businesses | Asian Financial Crisis]]
Indonesia's economic boom before the 1997 crisis was fueled by short-term external debts, which doubled from $70 billion in 1990 to $140 billion by mid-1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>. Most of this debt was borrowed by the private sector and invested in domestic ventures like construction and real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:00">[21:07:00]</a>.

When Thailand free-floated its currency on July 2, 1997, it triggered a contagion across Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>. Investors scrambled to pull capital out of the region. Bank Indonesia lacked sufficient reserves to defend the currency, leading to the Rupiah's free-float in August, causing it to lose over 30% of its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>. This devaluation severely affected Indonesian banks, as their foreign currency-denominated debt soared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:14:00">[22:14:00]</a>. Intense competition from 1989 banking reforms and high non-performing loans meant many banks were insolvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:00">[22:29:00]</a>.

In October 1997, 16 commercial banks closed, leading to bank runs despite resolution packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:46:00">[22:46:00]</a>. BCA, despite its seeming strength, was affected by rumors of Lim's death and a run on the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:58:00">[22:58:00]</a>.

### IMF Bailout and Suharto's Fall
Believing Indonesia was "too big to fail," the IMF announced a $33 billion bailout package in October 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>. This came with stringent economic reform conditions, including disassembling state and private monopolies, cutting subsidies on basic goods, and further opening up the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:24:00">[23:24:00]</a>. These demands targeted monopolies dominated by Suharto's cronies and family, hitting his supporters when he needed them most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>. Suharto resisted, publicly blaming currency manipulation for the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>. Relations with the IMF deteriorated, and the fund withheld payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:00">[25:10:00]</a>.

In May 1998, mass riots erupted in response to fuel subsidy cuts, often targeting ethnic Chinese and their businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>. A massive pro-democracy student demonstration also demanded Suharto's resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:42:00">[25:42:00]</a>. On May 21, 1998, Suharto resigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>.

### Aftermath for Salim Group
Lim Sioe Liong was out of the country during the riots, but his home was attacked and set on fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:58:00">[25:58:00]</a>. BCA and other Salim companies suffered fire damage, but the real blow came after Suharto's fall when the bank's association with cronyism led to a Titanic run, causing BCA to collapse. The central bank took over BCA and its $5 billion in debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:18:00">[26:18:00]</a>.

The massive and largely insolvent Salim Empire began to break apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:42:00">[26:42:00]</a>. Lim's son, Anthony Salim, negotiated a settlement with the government: Salim Group handed over stakes in over 100 Indonesian businesses, including Indocement and Indomobile, to repay the $5 billion bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a>. Crucially, Salim managed to retain a 50.1% share in their food company, Indofood, by moving those holdings offshore to the family's First Pacific financial company in Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:00">[27:24:00]</a>. Indofood has since become one of the world's biggest food companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:40:00">[27:40:00]</a>.

Lim never returned to Indonesia, dying peacefully in Singapore in 2012 at age 95 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:46:00">[27:46:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
Suharto's 32 years in power brought substantial economic benefits to Indonesia, with 7% annual economic growth and the development of legitimate agricultural and manufacturing bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:17:00">[28:17:00]</a>. However, the dark side of this growth was whom it enriched: Suharto made the nation richer, but perhaps not as rich as he made himself, his cronies, or his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>.

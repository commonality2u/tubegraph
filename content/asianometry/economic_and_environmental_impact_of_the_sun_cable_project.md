The Sun Cable project, also known as the [[australia_asean_power_link_and_sun_cable_megaproject | Australia-ASEAN Power Link]], is a proposed mega-project aiming to bring renewable solar energy from Australia to Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This initiative seeks to address Singapore's significant reliance on natural gas for 95% of its electricity due to limited space for extensive solar or wind farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Project Scope and Technology

The Sun Cable project proposes a 10-gigawatt capacity solar farm occupying 12,000 hectares in Australia's Northern Territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The electricity generated would first travel 800 kilometers to Darwin, contributing to local renewable energy goals, with the remainder exported to Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The export would occur via an intercontinental 3,700-kilometer High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) underwater power line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. A battery system near the solar farm is also proposed to meet overnight demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Why HVDC?

HVDC systems are crucial for long-distance power transmission due to their superior efficiency compared to High Voltage Alternating Current (HVAC) systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. While AC systems are generally more economical for shorter distances due to efficient transformers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, they suffer significant energy losses over long distances, partly due to the "skin effect" where current flows more densely at the cable's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

HVDC systems, despite requiring expensive and complex converters and inverters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, offer substantially better economics for long-distance power transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. For the Sun Cable's 3,200-kilometer route, HVDC is estimated to have about 10% electrical loss, whereas an equivalent HVAC line could experience over twice that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. HVDC is particularly well-suited for [[challenges_in_laying_and_protecting_undersea_cables | undersea infrastructure]] where intermediate substations are impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## [[subsea_cable_laying_and_its_technical_challenges | Challenges in Laying the Cable]]

Laying subsea cables involves two main rules: keeping the cable length as short as possible and avoiding deep trenches and steep slopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The proposed route for the Sun Cable project, starting from Darwin, crossing the Timor Sea, passing through Indonesia, and reaching Singapore, presents significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

*   **Depth**: While most of the route would be relatively shallow (less than 200 meters deep), a 1,200-kilometer section south of East Timor in the Timor Trough would see waters over a mile deep, posing a major challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This has been done before, such as with the SA.PE.I cable in Italy which reached similar depths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Material**: Deepwater cables may use aluminum instead of traditional copper. Aluminum is cheaper and lighter, allowing cable-laying vessels to carry and lay more of it, reducing expensive deepwater ship operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Interference**: For shallow, busy waterways like the Java Sea and Singapore Strait, engineers will likely need to trench or bury the cable 0.6-1.5 meters deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. This protects against damage from fishing nets, boat anchors, and other dropped items, which can cause blackouts and trigger liability clauses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Capacity**: A significant hurdle is the limited global manufacturing capacity for HVDC cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The Sun Cable's proposed two 3,200-kilometer cables exceed the total annual output of all HVDC cable manufacturers in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This necessitates setting aside additional money and 3-5 years to build up manufacturing capacity from multiple global manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Economic Impact and Cost Considerations

The estimated cost for the Sun Cable project is substantial:
*   The solar farm and battery storage alone are estimated at about $7 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   The subsea cable portion is projected to cost about $5.6 billion USD (before insurance and administrative expenses), with the majority ($4.6 billion) going to the cable itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   The total project cost is likely to exceed $10 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This is significantly more expensive than the Basslink cable in Australia, which cost $670 million USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

Funding for this privately-owned corporation has come from Australian billionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. However, to fund the entire project, multi-decade service agreements with entities purchasing the power will likely be necessary, similar to how Basslink derives cash flows from a 25-year service agreement with Hydro Tasmania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Lessons from Basslink

The Basslink cable, connecting Tasmania to mainland Australia, offers valuable lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Less than ten years after its 2006 commissioning, Basslink experienced a six-month outage due to cable damage, leading to arbitration and a $30 million USD fine against Basslink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This incident highlights the importance of robust planning and maintenance for such large-scale projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## Environmental and Broader Economic Impacts

Once fully deployed, the Sun Cable is projected to supply up to 20% of Singapore's energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

This project offers significant benefits beyond Singapore:
*   **Southeast Asia**: Energy demand in Southeast Asian countries is estimated to expand by 65% from 2015 to 2040, mostly from fossil fuels unless alternatives like the Sun Cable are implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Indonesia may also become a recipient of this clean electricity, given the cable passes through its waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Australia**: The project explores a new energy export paradigm for Australia, diversifying its economy which is heavily reliant on mining and petroleum exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Australia's Northern Territory is one of the most solar-irradiated areas globally, offering immense renewable energy potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This could help Australia reduce its dependence on carbon exports and foster stronger relationships with Southeast Asian nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

The project is scheduled to come online in 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

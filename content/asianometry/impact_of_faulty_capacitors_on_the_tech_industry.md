Starting in the early 2000s, reports emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> of an abnormal number of PC motherboards with leaking or popping capacitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Victims described hearing a loud "POP" and experiencing a "weird, fishy smell" before their computers failed to reboot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Upon inspection, small cylinders on the circuit board were found swollen or burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This widespread issue became known as the infamous [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## What is a Capacitor?

A capacitor stores electricity, similar to a battery, but discharges its energy rapidly, sometimes within microseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Its basic structure includes two electrically conductive plates (electrodes: anode and cathode) separated by a material called the dielectric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The term "capacitor" is also conceptually similar to components found in DRAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### [[electrolytic_capacitors_and_their_components | Electrolytic Capacitors]] (E-caps)

[[electrolytic_capacitors_and_their_components | Electrolytic capacitors]] (E-caps) use an electrolyte as their cathode or negative electrode, which can be a solid, gel, or liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. A typical E-cap is made of two strips of aluminium foil separated by a thin, porous paper saturated with electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The anode foil is coated with aluminium oxide, which acts as the dielectric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The entire assembly is rolled up in a sealed aluminium housing, often with a vent to release built-up gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

Aluminium E-caps are widely used due to their high capacitance for their size and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Manufacturers enhance their performance by etching the aluminium foil to increase the electrodes' surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Uses of E-caps

A PC motherboard might contain about 60 E-caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Their primary uses include:
*   **Filtering**: Smoothing out fluctuating DC power from a power supply unit, charging when voltage peaks and discharging when it dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Decoupling**: Smoothing power supply fluctuations for chips like microprocessors, absorbing voltage spikes and boosting dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Beyond PCs, E-caps are also found in camcorders, VCRs, televisions, stereos, and LCD screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The aluminium E-cap industry was valued at $3-$3.5 billion in 2002 and $5-$6 billion today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, with Japanese, Taiwanese, and Chinese suppliers producing billions of units annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. In 2002, Taiwan alone produced 22.5 billion E-caps, accounting for 30% of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Nature of Failure

As electrochemical components, [[electrolytic_capacitors_and_their_components | electrolytic capacitors]] age and corrode, having a shorter natural lifespan (10-20 years) than other capacitor types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Aging is often tracked by an increase in Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) and a decline in capacitance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Factors like humidity and heat can accelerate this aging, as heat can cause the electrolyte to dry out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

Catastrophic failures, such as bulging or exploding capacitors, cause short circuits or even fires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This type of failure became prominent in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## The "Capacitor Plague" Emerges

Reports of bulged or exploded capacitors largely began in late 2002, though some suggest mid-2002 or even earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. An electronics repairman in Utah, Gary Headlee, claimed to have replaced 40,000 leaky capacitors on nearly 1,500 motherboards in a year starting summer 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. He also noted a significant increase in faulty E-caps in Mitsubishi televisions, JVC VCRs, and Sony camcorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Carey Holzman, a journalist, began posting online in October 2002 about leaking capacitors in Taiwan-made motherboards like ABIT and Asus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## The Rubycon Story (Industrial Espionage Theory)

The most popular theory explaining the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]] was reported by Dennis Zogbi in "Passive Component Industry" magazine in September/October 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   A materials scientist from Japanese company Rubycon Corporation allegedly left to work for Taiwanese company Luminous Town Electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   The scientist supposedly replicated Rubycon's P-50 water-based electrolyte formula for Luminous Town <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   Later, some of the scientist's staffers defected from Luminous Town with the electrolyte formula, selling it to Taiwanese E-cap companies or an electrolyte provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   The critical flaw was that these defecting staffers did not have the *complete* formula; missing additives caused hydrogen gas build-up in the E-caps, leading to ruptures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Luminous Town Electric denied making the bad electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, but did not deny the story of stealing the formulation from Rubycon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Zogbi reported that 5 to 11 Taiwanese producers were affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, claiming "anybody who uses contract manufacturers that outsource to Taiwan was affected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. The timeline of this event is debated, with Zogbi indicating mid-2002, though other publications mentioned 2001 or even 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. IEEE Spectrum noted that affected E-caps bore unknown brands like "Tayeh" or "Choyo," or were unmarked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Fallout and Industry Response

Several computer manufacturers acknowledged issues with Taiwanese E-cap failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. IBM, then still making PCs, reported that a small number of desktop PCs (less than 1%) were returned for repair due to capacitor failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. While seemingly small, less than 1% of 148.1 million PCs shipped worldwide in 2002 could still lead to major disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

Taiwanese motherboard maker ABIT admitted to an E-cap problem and switched from Taiwanese to Japanese suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. However, ABIT was sued as early as 1999 for selling defective capacitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. ABIT settled, repaired the boards, and the costs may have contributed to their exit from the motherboard business in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

The IEEE Spectrum story named Lien Yan in Taichung as the electrolyte company accused of buying the flawed formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Lien Yan denied it, claiming the accusations damaged their business and were FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) spread by the Japanese to regain market share from Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Luxon, a major Taiwanese capacitor supplier, however, issued a statement blaming Lien Yan and emphasizing that they developed their own electrolytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

> Luxon definitely understands that the electrolyte is one of the most important materials for aluminum electrolytic capacitors. In order to ensure our reliability and innovative technology Luxon always develops the electrolyte by ourselves. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>

## The Electrolyte and Technical Explanation of Failure

The electrolyte is a critical trade secret that determines a capacitor's operating conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The Rubycon story suggested a missing component in the formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. A 2004 report by the Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering at the University of Maryland confirmed that bulging capacitors' electrolytes were missing a critical additive called a "depolarizer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

The lack of a depolarizer made the electrolyte more alkaline, causing the aluminium oxide dielectric layer to dissolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. This thinning of the dielectric led to unnaturally high capacitance, exposing the underlying aluminium foil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. Impurities in the foil then reacted to create spare electrons, which reacted with hydrogen ions in the water-based electrolyte to produce hydrogen gas, leading to bulging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

## Skepticism about a Single Cause

While the Rubycon industrial espionage story is compelling and likely had some truth, it's skeptical that it accounts for the entirety of the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

### Too Widespread and Misattribution
Many capacitor failures, even unrelated ones, were attributed to the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Plague]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. For example, the original Xbox (released November 2001) is known for a specific bad "clock capacitor" that fails after 6-7 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This capacitor was a PowerStor Aerogel by American company Cooper Industries and was a "supercapacitor" with carbon aerogel foam electrodes, not an aluminium E-cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Despite its unrelated nature, its timing led people to mistakenly blame it on the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Plague]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

### Weird Timelines
The Rubycon incident occurred around mid-2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Experts at the time suggested poor electrolyte E-caps would fail in as little as 250 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. However, failures continued into 2007.

In late 2005, another wave of bulging capacitors affected Apple, Hewlett-Packard, and especially Dell computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Dell shipped 11.8 million OptiPlex PCs between May 2003 and July 2005 with faulty capacitors that were 10 times more likely to bulge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Dell knew about the issue and tried to hide it, leading to a 2007 lawsuit and $300 million in replacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. All of these bad capacitors came from Japanese manufacturer Nichicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. This incident doesn't align neatly with the original Rubycon timeline.

### High Power and Heat Hypothesis
An alternative explanation for the widespread failures suggests that the issue stemmed from the use of new Low-ESR aluminium E-caps with water-based electrolytes, introduced in the late 1990s, to handle increasingly power-hungry computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. The early 2000s saw Intel and AMD aggressively pushing single-core clock rates, resulting in very hot microprocessors, such as the Pentium 4 chips in Dell's failed OptiPlex PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

It's hypothesized that these hotter microprocessors caused the water-based electrolytes in the new capacitors to boil, creating gas that popped their containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The transition to multi-core CPUs by AMD and Intel starting in 2005, which reduced internal temperatures, along with capacitor manufacturers refining their aqueous electrolyte formulations, helped end the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

### Counterfeits
Another contributing factor was the increasing complexity of the supply chain and the presence of counterfeits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. When legitimate supply chains were disrupted, OEMs sometimes resorted to unauthorized distributors, unknowingly purchasing counterfeit capacitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. A 2014 study of counterfeit Nichicon E-caps, discovered after the March 2011 earthquake, found their water-based electrolyte lacked enough ethylene glycol, lowering its boiling point and making it unstable at higher temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. This suggests that errors in electrolyte formulation were not uncommon.

## Conclusion

The [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]] is a complex story with various contributing factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. While industrial espionage, like the Rubycon incident, may have played a part, it is more likely that the "Plague" was an extended series of unconnected challenges faced by the capacitor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. This included the challenges of adapting new water-based electrolytes to increasingly hot microprocessors and issues with supply chain integrity leading to counterfeits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

Today, aluminium E-caps with water-based electrolytes are still in use, offering good capacitance for their size and price, and vendors have largely addressed the initial kinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. The little round can on the circuit board can now typically go unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

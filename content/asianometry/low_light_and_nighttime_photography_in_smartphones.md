One of the most impressive advancements in modern smartphones, such as the iPhone 13 Pro, is their low light and nighttime photography performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. This area has seen significant breakthroughs in [[image_processing_and_computational_photography | computational photography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Overcoming Hardware Limitations
Traditionally, high-quality low light photography was thought to be exclusively possible with DSLRs, which feature larger image pixels, adjustable apertures, and the use of tripods to capture sufficient light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Smartphone camera hardware, due to its small size and physical constraints, is inherently not capable of achieving this in the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

However, smartphone camera manufacturers have adapted existing photography techniques to overcome these limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

## Burst Processing and Image Stacking
The core technique employed is **burst processing**, which involves continuously capturing and merging many image frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This method has its origins in astrophotography, where image stacking is used to combine multiple night sky exposures to reduce noise and produce clearer images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

In [[smartphone_camera_technology_advancements | smartphone]] burst processing:
*   The camera continuously captures and stores frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   When the shutter button is pressed, the system selects a frame closest to that moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   All other captured frames are then merged with the selected frame to create a single, high-quality image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

This process presents [[engineering_challenges_in_smartphone_cameras | challenges]], such as reliably aligning the sequence of images, as incorrect alignment can lead to image distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. When executed correctly, however, the results are very effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

### Google Pixel's Night Sight
A significant breakthrough in low-light photography was spearheaded by the 2018 Google Pixel phone with its "Night Sight" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Camera designers dedicated considerable effort to adjusting for factors like shaky hands and moving objects in the scene that could cause blur, leading to impressive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Since then, other phone manufacturers have adopted similar techniques as a general tool for improved photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

Burst photography is also utilized for:
*   Denoising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>
*   Increasing image resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>
*   High dynamic range compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>

## The Role of [[machine_learning_in_smartphone_camera_enhancements | Machine Learning]]
Recent advancements in onboard AI processor technology have further pushed the boundaries of imaging performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

### White Balance Correction
[[Machine learning in smartphone camera enhancements | Machine learning]] models are trained on vast datasets of digital photos that have been manually white-balanced by professional photographers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. This approach generates more effective color constancy algorithms, proving particularly helpful in low-light conditions and featuring prominently in Google Pixel's Night Sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

## The Computational Nature of Smartphone Photography
Modern smartphone cameras rely heavily on [[image_processing_and_computational_photography | computer processing]] and image manipulation to produce their results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. The image data saved and uploaded is significantly "doctored" from what the sensor originally "sees," using everything from simple mathematical operations to complex [[machine_learning_in_smartphone_camera_enhancements | machine learning]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. This is likened to filling in "gaps in the genome" to create a desired outcome, prioritizing a visually appealing image over a raw, un-processed reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

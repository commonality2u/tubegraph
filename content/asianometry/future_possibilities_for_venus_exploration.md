Despite the groundbreaking achievements of the [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Soviet Venera missions to Venus]] in the 1970s and 80s, which successfully landed five probes on the Venusian surface, no nation has attempted to land a legitimate probe on Venus since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Historical Context and Shift in Focus

The [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera series]] represented a pinnacle of [[soviet_space_exploration_achievements and_failures | Soviet space exploration achievement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. However, space programs have since shifted their primary focus to the Moon and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. This shift is partly due to the understanding that "no human is ever going to set foot on Venus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>, given its extremely hostile environment.

## Challenges and Economic Considerations

One of the primary [[challenges_of_landing_on_venus | challenges for Venus exploration]] is economic viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Investing significant time and resources into a lander that might survive for less than a day is considered "insane" by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. The [[engineering_breakthroughs_in_venera_landers | Venera landers]], despite their robust design, lasted for limited durations on the surface due to the extreme heat (462°C / 864°F) and immense pressure (equivalent to over 0.5 miles under water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The corrosive sulfuric acid clouds also present a major hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Future Possibilities and Technological Needs

Despite the daunting environment, sending another lander to Venus is "possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Engineers have a clear understanding of the expected conditions and the feasibility, especially considering the Soviets achieved their success with "decades-old technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

To make future lander missions more economically justifiable, the technology must allow probes to "move around and last for weeks on end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Currently, the necessary cooling technologies to achieve such prolonged operation are "a few years away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

However, "interesting developments in extreme environment technologies" suggest that a return trip could be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. While some "secret work done during the Soviet era for the [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera series]] is now lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, new advancements could pave the way for more resilient probes.

Alternative proposals for Venus exploration primarily focus on high-altitude observations, such as "balloons and other high altitude floating explorations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

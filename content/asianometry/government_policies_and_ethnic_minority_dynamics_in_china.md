[[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han ethnic supremacy]] is an emerging point of concern on China's internet and in cultural backwaters, with proponents expressing real views that should not be dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Defining "Han Ethnicity"
The definition of "Han" is a complex question, similar to defining "white" in America, where groups like Italians, Irish, and Jewish people were not initially considered white but are now mainstreamly accepted as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Han ethnicity is subject to the times and current era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It is not about a distinct nationality, ethnicity, or race, but rather a "constructed bundle" of items, such as adherence to Confucian values or certain rites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The existence of groups like the Hakka and Cantonese serves as proof of this fluid definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

In contrast, [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacists]] disregard this nuance, viewing "Han-ness" as a single, mono-race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. They assert that Han people are the "core race in China," with their interests being "one and one with those of China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. They describe Han as having "five thousand years of direct racial inheritance" and "their blood is one of the purest in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. However, in reality, Han people are genetically a "deeply intermixed breed," having mixed for generations as they migrated across China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Historical Context of Ethnic Relations
For over the past 1,000 years, China has been ruled longer by foreigners than by members of its Han people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Toppling the Qing Dynasty
Han nationalism played a role in toppling the Qing Dynasty and establishing both the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Centuries of rule by the Manchu people grated against the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Chinese elites seeking power would rail against the "furry and horned" Manchu, attempting to unite the "pure Han race" against their enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Republic of China (ROC)
When the ROC came to power, Sun Yat-sen recognized that continued feelings of [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacy]] would divide the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Observing other World War I era empires like Russia and Austria-Hungary splitting due to minority populations, Sun wanted to prevent a similar fate for Qing-era China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Thus, Sun and the Guomindang party promoted racial harmony as a core tenet of ROC rule, personified by the five-colored flag and the principle of "five races under one union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. At other times, the ROC advocated for a single unified Chinese race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. However, Han ethnocentrism remained a lingering issue for governance and the suppression of ethnic minorities was a major social problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) gained support from China's ethnic minorities who were disillusioned with their standing in the Republic of China, making them a critical constituency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Mao Zedong personally held strong views on the value of China's ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

<blockquote>"All through the ages, the reactionary rulers, chiefly from the Han nationality, sowed feelings of estrangement among our various nationalities and bullied the minority peoples. Even among the working people, it is not easy to eliminate the resultant influences in a short time. So we have to make extensive and sustained efforts to educate both the cadres and the masses in our proletarian nationality policy, and make a point of frequently reviewing the relationship between that Han nationality and the minority nationalities. If the relationship is found to be abnormal, then we must deal with it in earnest, and not just in words." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a></blockquote>

The PRC pays significant attention to ethnic minority and racial harmony issues for both ideological and practical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Despite not being known for gender equality, the CCP has done an admirable job of finding and promoting high-performing cadres from ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## CCP's Policies on Ethnic Minorities
In the 1950s, the CCP helped create and codify China's ethnic minorities, sending teams to locate, classify, and protect non-Han ethnic cultures, resulting in the recognition of 56 separate nationalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The People's Congress then crafted a series of affirmative action policies and preferential treatment to help China's minorities achieve an even level with the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Benefits include:
*   **Regional ethnic autonomous states** within China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Dedicated museums, parks, schools, events, and authorities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Preferential treatment in China's national testing exam (Gaokao)**: Minorities in western China, for example, may require only 200 points, while Han people need 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Exception to the One-Child Policy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
    *   This policy has seen the proportion of ethnic minorities in China increase from 3% in 1949 to 8% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

Similar affirmative action policies are also reflected in Taiwan, where members of recognized aboriginal tribes receive similar benefits in their college exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Consequences and Resentment
These affirmative action policies were introduced to address significant existing gaps between ethnic minorities and the Han majority, similar to the income, wealth, and employment gaps seen between white and black Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. However, these policies appear to have largely failed to close the generation gaps and have instead succeeded in cultivating resentment from the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Many Han Chinese perceive that the Han majority, who are the "crucial driver of the Chinese nation and its glorious history," are not treated the same as ethnic minorities and are instead seen as part of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Han Cultural Movements and Historical Revisionism
Such views have found strong adherence in "dark corners of the Chinese internet," with dozens of [[han_cultural_movements_and_their_implications | Han culture forums and websites]] emerging in China, Taiwan, and the overseas Chinese diaspora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. These sites advocate for the revitalization of certain aspects of Chinese Han culture while rejecting others for their non-Han origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

For example, the **Hanfu movement** encouraged the wearing of Hanfu clothing, worn before the "alien rule" of the Manchu conquest of the Ming Dynasty, rejecting Qing-era clothing like the Manchu *chi pao* or *makwa* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. While many adopted the Hanfu movement for its aesthetic appeal or to connect with their culture, it and other sites promoting Han culture eventually served as a "gateway drug" for "harder versions of [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

[[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han ethnocentrists]] hold a special dislike for the Manchu people, vigorously revising views of the Qing and Yuan dynasties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. They paint the Qing Dynasty and its Manchu leaders as bloodthirsty, claiming they rolled back Ming Dynasty advancements, stole Han wealth, butchered the Han, and made China a backward country, thus allowing the West to advance and invade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. They equate the Manchu to colonists, similar to the British in India, citing historical records of countless deaths during the Qing conquest of the Ming Dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This simplistic narrative of "bad Manchu victimizing innocent Han" is a "hijacking of history" for their own purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The goal of such historical revisionism is to reject 300 years of China's history and attribute its decline to a "foreign race," absolving the Han of any blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Specific Grievances Against CCP Policies
The CCP's affirmative action policies receive significant legitimate online criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Many Han netizens believe the government entered a "quiet deal" with ethnic minorities: "If you do not attempt independence, you get showered with special privileges" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

The two most aggravating policies for netizens are the national examination thresholds and the exemption to the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. For [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacists]], the one-child policy exemption makes Han people "the only country in the world with the people conducting their own self-destruction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Coupled with easier Gaokao thresholds, the perception persists that "there are more ethnic minorities running around and they are dumber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

Incidents of ethnic violence, such as the late 2000s riots in Urumqi, also trigger the worst of [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. The complaint is that ethnic minorities can attack Han people or rob them, and authorities will allow it "in the name of national unity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Parallels and Broader Context
Racial issues are a challenge for any government with minority and majority populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Despite the common perception of China as a "one-race monolith," ethnic minority problems cause significant challenges for the Chinese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

Parallels exist with the United States of America, where the founding fathers created a nation binding different races and creeds through concepts of freedom and pursuit of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Over decades, Americans have tried to be more inclusive and expand the definition of what it means to be American <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. However, there are darker schools of thought advocating for America's success built on Christianity and exclusively Christian values, or even further, for American white ethnocentrism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

The Chinese nation faces its own version of this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>:
1.  **Inclusiveness:** One school of thought advocates that individuals can be accepted into Chinese society and even the Han race by practicing Confucian values and rites, emphasizing that China is a nation of many races united together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
2.  **Exclusiveness:** A darker school of thought argues for an inherent gap between Han people and "barbarians"—a label with deep historical significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. To them, other races are "born barbarians," their blood is barbarian, and assimilation is a "fool's errand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

These issues are not exclusive to China; such sites are prevalent in America, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, and wherever Chinese people live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The problem is most troubling in areas with significant Han majorities, such as China and Singapore, which are the only Han-majority countries with substantial minority populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

In China, the government has attempted to address these concerns and foster cross-ethnic unity by creating a feeling of "us of China versus them of the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. By portraying all Westerners as foreigners and encouraging a level of "anti-foreign energy," it hopes to suppress feelings of [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. While this tactic may work, its long-term health is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

[[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacism]] is considered a serious and widespread problem, and there is a concern that government officials, many of whom are Han, may be susceptible to this "creed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

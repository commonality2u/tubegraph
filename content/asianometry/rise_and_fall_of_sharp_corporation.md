Sharp Corporation, a Japanese electronics company, delivered many iconic products over the years, including the mechanical pencil, calculators, and TVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, starting at the turn of the century, Sharp found itself increasingly trapped in a single, incredibly competitive business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Attacked by foreign competitors and running out of money, the company eventually sold itself to a Taiwanese electronics giant, marking the first foreign takeover of a major Japanese consumer electronics company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Founding and Early Innovations

The founder of Sharp, Takuji Hayakawa, was born in Tokyo in 1893 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. After a difficult childhood, he began an apprenticeship with a metal worker at the age of eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Seven years later, Hayakawa graduated and invented his first product: the "tokubido" belt buckle, which could be fastened without punching holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This buckle was a hit, selling 4,752 pieces and leading Hayakawa to open his own metal workshop in Tokyo at age 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

A few years later, in 1915, an order for metal innards for a mechanical pencil inspired Hayakawa to produce a superior version, the "Hayakawa Mechanical Pencil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This pencil was highly successful, especially as Germany, a major exporter of pencils, was engaged in World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The business expanded rapidly, and by 1923, Hayakawa and his brother Masaharu built a new factory with 200 workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

However, on September 1, 1923, the Great Kanto earthquake struck, leading to massive fires that destroyed Hayakawa's factory and resulted in the loss of his wife and two young children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Despite the tragedy, Hayakawa rebuilt his business in Osaka, establishing Hayakawa Metal Laboratories in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Entry into Electronics

In Osaka, Hayakawa turned his attention to radios. In 1925, after reverse-engineering an imported radio, his company released its own domestically assembled crystal radio called the "Sharp," drastically cheaper than foreign competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The Sharp radio's timing was perfect, coinciding with the launch of Japan's first radio program by the Tokyo Broadcasting Station (ancestor of NHK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

Hayakawa quickly moved to vacuum tube radios, producing the "Sharp-Dyne" series, which were more powerful and affordable than imported models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Sales surged, leading to the construction of a new factory and a production line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. In 1942, the company officially changed its name to Hayakawa Electric Company, producing various radios, including those for the military effort, which helped sustain the company through the war and post-war reconstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Post-War Diversification and Calculator Dominance

In 1951, as NHK began experimental television broadcasts, Hayakawa Electric aimed to be ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. With technical assistance from RCA, the company produced the TV3-14T, Japan's first commercially available television, released in February 1953 alongside NHK's first public broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Despite a high initial cost, the product's timely entry secured Hayakawa's dominance in the domestic television market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

Hayakawa Electric rapidly diversified, releasing Japan's first microwave (the R-10) and first solar-powered consumer electronics product (a transistor radio) in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The company also remained a significant solar cell producer into the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### The Calculator Wars

A pivotal product that put the company on the global electronics map was the calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. After being excluded from Japan's mainframe computer development program, Hayakawa focused on sophisticated, non-programmable consumer electronics like calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. In 1964, they released the CS-10A Comfat, one of the first all-transistor calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. It sold out its initial supply despite its high price and weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

Subsequent models, like the CS-20A and CS-31A (the first desktop calculator using integrated circuits), were cheaper, more efficient, and lighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. By 1966, Hayakawa led the Japanese calculator industry with 44% market share, exporting half its units to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. In 1970, Hayakawa Electric changed its name to Sharp Corporation, taking its name from the mechanical pencil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

Sharp's success in calculators triggered the "Calculator Wars," with over 50 Japanese manufacturers entering the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This intense competition rapidly transformed calculators from desktop machines into portable, battery-powered gadgets powered by a single integrated chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## LCD Dominance and Strategic Risks

In 1969, a Sharp researcher learned about Dynamic Scattering Mode (DSM) Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) from an RCA documentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Although RCA had reservations about LCDs, Sharp licensed their patents in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. After extensive research, Sharp introduced the LC-Mate EL-805 in June 1973, a revolutionary calculator that was significantly thinner, used vastly less power, and weighed much less than existing models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. By 1985, Sharp had cumulatively sold over 200 million calculator units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

Sharp continued its LCD research, identifying IBM's Thin-Film Transistor (TFT) LCD as a potential CRT replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. In 1987, Sharp successfully produced a 14-inch full-color, full-motion LCD display, leapfrogging competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. This led to the debut of the first wall-mounted television in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

### The Pivot to "Crystal Clear Company"

However, this strong LCD position contrasted with the rest of the company's struggles following Japan's economic recession in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Cheap foreign imports challenged Sharp's older product lines, and new categories like electronic organizers and notebook PCs failed to generate sufficient profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Net income declined significantly, leading to the resignation of Sharp's president in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

With LCD panels accounting for 30% of company revenues, new president Katsuhiko Machida repositioned Sharp's LCD business at its core, aiming to make it the company's "clear face for customers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Sharp ditched its venerable CRT television business and went all-in on LCD televisions, launching its Aquos TV brand in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. This bold move seemed to pay off initially, with Aquos quickly capturing 80% global market share in the nascent LCD TV market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. By mid-2003, Aquos dominated the Japanese market with 60% share, and in 2004, Sharp held a leading 33% market share in the overall LCD industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

## Decline and Financial Struggles

Despite early success, competitors like Samsung, Sony, and LG caught up rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. Samsung surprised the industry by being the first to produce leading-edge 5th generation LCDs in early 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. In response, Sharp invested billions of yen into new TFT LCD factories across Japan, most notably the Kamiyama plant (completed 2004-2006) and the Sakai factories (announced 2007) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. These massive investments, totaling billions of USD, were intended to cement Sharp's lead and were made despite waiving long-standing financial rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

However, these plants came online concurrently with other massive facilities built by competitors, leading to a situation of oversupply in the LCD panel industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Panel prices plummeted, and Sharp's TV market share fell from 80% to under 10% throughout the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. The LCD television was becoming a cheap commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

Sharp attempted to focus on selling LCD panels to other businesses, aiming for over 50% external sales, but this ratio never cleared 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. The massive investments in LCD production did not pay off as expected due to intense competition from Taiwan, South Korea, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

A planned partnership with Sony for the Sakai factories also fell through due to Sharp's internal management issues, where its own TV division competed with its potential panel customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. The global financial crisis further exacerbated sales collapse and increased losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. In March 2009, Sharp announced its first net loss since going public in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

Despite admitting mistakes in local production, Sharp continued to invest in Sakai Display, keeping LCD at the center of their strategy even as the TV business deteriorated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. By 2009, Sharp's TV market share was just 6-7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. Sales declined by $10 billion from 2008 to 2012, and the company reported a net loss of over $5 billion, nearly leading to bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. Sharp also missed critical industry transitions, such as the shift to LED-backlit LCD screens and OLED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

## [[acquisition_of_sharp_by_foxconn|Acquisition by Foxconn]]

In March 2013, Sharp announced a staggering $5 billion loss, leading to the exit of all three influential leaders and former leaders: Katayama, Machida, and Okida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. The company never regained its footing, losing its grip on the domestic Japanese smartphone market to Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics giant, first bought a 9.9% stake in Sharp in 2012 for $854 million, also acquiring a larger share in Sakai Display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Foxconn, known for its "land and expand" business model, aimed to take over clients' entire manufacturing supply chains, with displays being the most expensive component in electronics gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. Although Foxconn sought a more substantial partnership or even an acquisition, Sharp initially declined for several more loss-making years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

Finally, in 2016, after three more difficult years, Sharp accepted Foxconn's offer to purchase a controlling 66% stake for $6.2 billion, though the offer was later revised down to $3.8 billion due to newly revealed financial liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. Sharp's bank creditors ultimately sided with Foxconn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

The [[acquisition_of_sharp_by_foxconn|acquisition by Foxconn]] represented the first foreign takeover of a leading Japanese electronics firm, a sad end for a venerable 100-year-old company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. Foxconn appointed Taiwanese executive Tai Jung-woo as Sharp's new CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. He immediately implemented cost-cutting measures, closing unprofitable overseas ventures, reducing employees, and moving production out of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. In its first full year under Taiwanese management, Sharp returned a small profit for the first time in four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Tai reoriented the company back towards producing branded electronics products and began rebuilding Sharp's semiconductor manufacturing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. In February 2022, Tai retired, and a new Foxconn CEO, previously head of Sharp's brand products division, took the helm, indicating a continued focus on branded products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

Sharp Corporation rose to become a consumer electronics giant not necessarily because it had the best technologies, but because it used technology to produce the right products at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. However, as the company became overly reliant on LCDs, its confidence in its technology proved insufficient in the brutal, low-margin, high-insecurity display panel business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

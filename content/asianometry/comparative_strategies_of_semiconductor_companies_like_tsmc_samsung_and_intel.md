The semiconductor industry is currently undergoing a significant transition from FinFET transistors to Gate-All-Around (GAAFET) technology, a shift that is influencing the competitive strategies of major players like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This transition is seen as a potential turning point in the foundry [[competition_between_tsmc_and_samsung | competition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## TSMC's N2 Process Node Strategy

TSMC's N2 process node is considered one of its most ambitious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. In their 4Q2023 earnings call, TSMC announced plans for three new N2 fabs in Hsinchu, Kaohsiung, and Taichung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The N2 process involves a special type of transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, marking TSMC's adoption of vertically-stacked, gate-all-around, nanosheet/nanowire metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

TSMC has historically dominated the over ten years of the FinFET era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. While Intel produced the first commercial FinFET devices in 2011, TSMC followed a few years later in 2013 with their 16-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

For its N2 node, TSMC management has reported a "much higher level of customer interest and engagement" compared to the N3 node at a similar stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This indicates strong customer confidence in TSMC's upcoming GAAFET offerings, particularly for mobile and AI processing applications due to significant power draw benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

However, TSMC's N2 will not include backside power technology until about a year later with their second-generation N2 processes (N2P and N2X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Many industry observers see this as a major advantage for Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## Samsung's Early GAAFET Push

Samsung has been a leader in the drive into GAAFET technology, conducting research on it since at least 2003 with their multibridge-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Samsung and Intel have moved ahead with Gate-All-Around technology in an attempt to gain market share, following TSMC's dominance in the FinFET era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

Samsung began offering its first GAAFET process, named SF3E, in mid-2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. While this node did ship some products, they primarily consisted of crypto miner chips, with no major digital logic products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. In late 2023, Samsung released their second-generation GAAFET node, SF3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

## Intel's "RibbonFET" and Backside Power Innovation

Intel's GAAFET offering is named "RibbonFET" or "Nanoribbon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Their first process node to utilize this technology is 20A, an internal node scheduled for mid-2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Following 20A is 18A, which is widely anticipated to restore Intel's leadership position in the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

Intel's GAAFET processes (20A and 18A) include another notable innovation: Backside Power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This technology relocates power lines underneath the silicon substrates, creating additional space for transistor density and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Intel's earlier adoption of High-K dielectrics in 2007 for their High-K metal gate also helped pave the way for advanced atomic layer deposition techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Competitive Outlook

Semiconductor industry observers have long viewed the FinFET-to-GAAFET transition as a crucial turning point in foundry [[competition_between_tsmc_and_samsung | competition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. The prevailing belief is that the first company to achieve high-volume production with GAAFET will gain a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

However, the process flows for FinFET and GAAFET share close similarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Being proficient in FinFET manufacturing will likely translate to proficiency in GAAFET manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## Beyond GAAFET: Future Transistor Architectures

While the industry focuses on the GAAFET transition, research and development continue on next-generation transistor structures. Imec, a leading R&D institute based in Belgium, is exploring designs such as:
*   **Forkshet:** An evolutionary step from GAAFET, featuring a wall through a bundle of vertically stacked sheets, offering higher gate control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **Complementary FET (CFET):** A design where nanosheets or fins are folded on top of one another, creating a true 3D transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

These advanced architectures, though not yet in production planning, demonstrate the industry's continuous pursuit of innovation beyond the current [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | generational shifts in semiconductor manufacturing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

Following a new round of sanctions in late February 2022, Taiwan's [[Impact of TSMC sanctions on Russia | Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)]] halted shipments to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This halt affected shipments to fabless companies like Baikal, MCST, Yadro, and STC Module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Intel and AMD also stopped their shipments to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This situation has intensified Russia's long-standing challenge of creating its own supply of semiconductors, as its domestic manufacturing capacity has fallen increasingly behind despite some domestic design successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Historical Context of Russia's Semiconductor Industry
Since the 1960s, the Soviet Union has suffered from a significant technology gap with the United States in computers and advanced electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. By the time of the Soviet collapse in 1991, the country faced a painful shortage of sufficiently powerful integrated circuits, with the combined computing power of all computers in the country still two generations behind a single American Cray supercomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

The collapse further fragmented the Soviet scientific industrial complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Russia was left with 96% of vacuum electronics production facilities, while the more advanced semiconductor production facilities were located in East Germany, Belarus, and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Subsequent Russian industrial policy, pivoting away from domestic electronics, increased the country's dependence on imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Today, Russia remains a net importer of integrated circuits, primarily from Malaysia, China, Vietnam, and other Asian countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Domestic Semiconductor Manufacturing Capabilities
In 2014, threatened sanctions following the annexation of Crimea spurred the Russian government to develop homegrown chips through an import substitution scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### JSC Micron Group
Micron Group is Russia's largest [[Russian semiconductor manufacturing companies and capabilities | domestic semiconductor manufacturing company]], founded in 1964 as the Research Institute for Molecular Electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. It is an integrated design manufacturer, producing around 500 million chips annually and accounting for 54% of Russia's exported technology hardware products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Micron's Zelenograd fab produces 100, 150, and 200 millimeter wafers, with the 200mm line being the most sophisticated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

*   **Process Nodes**: In 2007, Micron acquired intellectual property for STMicroelectronics' 180-nanometer process node, which expanded to the 90-nanometer node in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The 90-nanometer line launched in 2012, approximately nine years behind the leading edge at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. In 2014, Micron announced the successful achievement of a 65-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. However, this was more a "working science experiment" than a commercial offering, as it lacks necessary lithography scanners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The company's website still lists 65-nanometer production as "under development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This means Russia's gap with the leading edge has grown to over 15 years for 65nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Products**: Micron specializes in RFID products, producing around 30 million banking cards, biometric passports, and transport cards annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. They fab bank chips for Russia's domestic payment card system, Mir, and travel tickets for Moscow's transport network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Financials**: In 2019, Micron generated $195 million USD in revenues, rising to $260 million USD in 2020, though the latter was bolstered by large government subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Expansion Plans**: In 2016, a new management team announced plans to invest in expanding the factory to produce more chip types and LEDs, aiming for 30 billion rubles of revenue by 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This plan included a 28-nanometer capable factory by 2018, but the company missed its 2020 revenue target by 15 billion rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### Citronix
A sister company to Micron, Citronix applied for a subsidy in 2007 to develop a chip manufacturing fab at 65 and 45-nanometer process nodes on 300-millimeter wafers, costing approximately $2.3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Chip production was slated for 2009, but the sheer capital intensity and lack of technology partners likely prevented the project from moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Currently, their website only lists servers, IT software, and smartwatches, with no chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Angstrom
Angstrom is another leading [[Russian semiconductor manufacturing companies and capabilities | Russian microelectronics fab]], founded in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

*   **Process Nodes**: The foundry currently offers 130-nanometer and 90-nanometer process nodes on 200-millimeter wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Its capacity is around 180,000 wafers per year, a "far cry" from a TSMC gigafab that produces an equivalent number in a single month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Financial Issues**: In 2008, Angstrom borrowed nearly a billion dollars from the state development bank VEB to purchase old 110 and 130-nanometer chip-making equipment from AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The plan was to produce 90-nanometer smart card microchips by 2010 and upgrade to 65-nanometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. However, chips didn't start rolling off the line until 2016, and their 65-nanometer process is still not available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Sanctions and Bankruptcy**: Angstrom was hit by U.S. sanctions, likely due to its involvement in the Russian military and nuclear industries, which prevented it from building an export business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This, combined with debt, pushed it into insolvency, leading to bankruptcy in 2018 or 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. In 2021, VEB's subsidiary, NM Tech, purchased Angstrom's assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. NM Tech has a 10-year plan to convert Angstrom into a pure-play foundry and achieve 10-nanometer production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## Russian Chip Design Companies and Foreign Fabs
Due to the lagging capabilities of Russia's domestic industry, more sophisticated semiconductor design ventures have had to go abroad to fab their chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies (MCST) - Elbrus
MCST developed the Elbrus microprocessors. The Elbrus 2SM, created in 2014, was declared Russia's number one technology achievement of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. This 90-nanometer processor was likely for PR purposes rather than real use, as an earlier iteration made on a [[Impact of TSMC sanctions on Russia | TSMC]] 90-nanometer node reportedly performed much better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The latest iteration, the Elbrus 8CB, is fabbed on a 28-nanometer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

### Baikal Electronics - Baikal CPUs
Baikal Electronics develops ARM-based chips using modern practices and EDA tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Their latest offering, the Baikal-M series, is an eight-core system-on-chip fabbed on a [[Impact of TSMC sanctions on Russia | TSMC]] 28-nanometer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. A RISC-V version is also being explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Baikal had planned to order over 200,000 pieces from [[Impact of TSMC sanctions on Russia | TSMC]] in Q1 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. In June 2021, Baikal was acquired by Vartan Group, which also makes Russia's domestic OS, AstroLinux, used by the Russian government and military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Baikal then announced a plan to invest 23 billion rubles to push into the server space, develop a six-nanometer chip, and sell over half a million chips, mostly to government organizations meeting import substitution policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

## Potential Alternatives in Friendly Countries

Given the [[Russias domestic semiconductor industry challenges | domestic industry's lagging capabilities]], Russia is seeking alternatives in friendly countries.

### Belarus - Integral
Integral was one of the "big three" Soviet semiconductor manufacturers, launched in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Its most sophisticated node, as of a 2017 sales document, is a 350-nanometer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. This node first hit the market in 1993 and was used for the Nintendo 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This is not a viable alternative to a [[Impact of TSMC sanctions on Russia | TSMC]] 28-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### China - SMIC
Chinese semiconductor foundries might be a more capable [[Impact of TSMC sanctions on Russia | TSMC]] replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Shanghai-based SMIC's most advanced node is a 14-nanometer process, rumored to have good yields, though it's not a large part of their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. SMIC had a very good 2021 and is investing $9 billion into a new fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Considering the current warm relations between Russia and China, SMIC could seem like a logical choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

However, SMIC heavily relies on chip-making equipment imports from the Netherlands and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. This dependency means that SMIC itself could be affected by secondary sanctions or restrictions on equipment, potentially limiting its ability to serve Russia's needs for more advanced chips.

## Conclusion
In the short and medium term, the [[Impact of TSMC sanctions on Russia | TSMC]] halt may not have an immediate catastrophic effect due to Russia's stockpiles and the fact that certain military equipment does not require leading-edge chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. However, it will put what remains of Russia's industries even further behind its competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Russia already lags significantly in digitization and modernization, with 23 times fewer industrial robots per 10,000 employees than the world average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

It is doubtful that the [[Russian semiconductor manufacturing companies and capabilities | Russian semiconductor manufacturing industry]] will advance past 65 nanometers in the foreseeable future given these circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. These sanctions make it significantly harder for Russian businesses and ordinary citizens to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. The inability to close the widening technology gap contributed to a broad loss of confidence in the Soviet communist party's competency during its late regime, and while times are different, historical parallels are noteworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

The hard disk drive (HDD) was once the most expensive component of a personal computer (PC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It remains a complex piece of technology, with magnetically enabled heads flying over glass platters to read and write data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article explores the birth, boom, and bust of the [[rise_and_fall_of_the_hard_disk_drive_industry | Hard Disk Drive industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Beginnings
In 1952, IBM established a new research lab in San Jose, asking former high school teacher Reynold B. Johnson to lead it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Johnson was a talented inventor who, in the 1930s, created a machine to grade pencil-marked multiple-choice tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. IBM acquired the rights to his machine and hired him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. San Jose was chosen for the lab's location due to its position between major IBM customers in Los Angeles and Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Johnson was given significant autonomy to hire 30-50 people and pursue various projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. One prominent project was a random access processing system intended to replace "tub files," which were part of a punched card system for quick information access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. While effective in some cases, tub files were less suitable for applications like invoicing and inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Random access allows any piece of information in a sequence to be accessed in roughly the same amount of time, a contrast to sequential access, where one must cycle through all preceding data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. For memory systems, random access is superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Disks
The IBM team decided to explore magnetic recording systems to achieve this random access function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. A magnetic recording system stores data on magnetic media, which is then read or written by a mounted head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. They evaluated various forms of magnetic media, including magnetic tape, drums, plates, wires, and rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Johnson ultimately opted for a stack of rotating magnetic disks, with each disk accessible by read/write heads mounted on a common actuator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. He favored this format for its significant surface area relative to size and its potential for simultaneous data access across multiple disks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. An early prototype featured about 120 aluminum disks, each two feet wide, stacked a quarter-inch apart on a shaft and spinning at approximately 3,600 revolutions per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Building RAMAC
Two primary technical challenges emerged during development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. First, they needed a method to evenly and smoothly apply iron oxide paint to the disk surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. An engineer suggested a technique now known as "spin-on," where the disks spun at high speed while paint (the same used for the Golden Gate Bridge) was poured at the center, spreading uniformly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Second, they had to address disk wobble. A team led by Bill Goddard and John Lynott integrated an air nozzle into the head, using air pressure to create a cushion that kept the head stable a thousandth of an inch above the wobbling disk surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Mounted on a single arm, the head could move vertically to access the correct disk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

In 1956, IBM introduced the 305 “Random Access Method of Accounting and Control” (RAMAC), a transaction processing system built around what is recognized as the first hard drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This drive consisted of 50 iron oxide-coated disks, each about 61 centimeters wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. It cost a quarter of a million dollars, stored approximately 4.4 megabytes, and was the size of two refrigerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Despite these seemingly comedic stats today, it was an engineering marvel at the time, particularly its ability to retrieve data in under a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. IBM President Thomas Watson Jr. declared its announcement on September 4, 1956, as the "greatest product day in IBM's history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The first RAMAC was shipped to the Zellerbach Paper Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev visited the RAMAC factory in 1959 during his US tour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## An Industry is Born
IBM's [[Innovations and challenges in hard disk drive technology | innovation]] made the disk drive an essential computer component, thus birthing an industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Initially, other computer manufacturers like General Electric and Burroughs began producing their own hard disk drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Subsequently, independent disk companies such as Bryant Computer Products and Data Products emerged, offering third-party HDDs to computer makers lacking in-house expertise or capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. By the mid-1960s, Japanese firms like NEC, Fujitsu, and Hitachi also entered the market, primarily for internal consumption as vertically integrated players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

In 1966, IBM introduced its 2314 File Facility and disk packs, which provided improved speed and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Its 29-megabyte disk pack format also made storage swapping easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This led to a new wave of independent companies that copied the disk pack format, marketing "plug compatible" products to IBM customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Winchester
Throughout the 1960s, IBM continued to introduce leading [[Innovations and challenges in hard disk drive technology | innovations]] in hard disk drive storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Their most significant achievement was the introduction of the Winchester drive in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The name originated from a comment by IBM San Jose manager Kenneth E. Haughton; the original project spec was for two 30-megabyte spindles, leading Haughton to call it a "30-30," which then became "Winchester" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

Previously, HDD disks were removable and accessible, but this led to particle contamination issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. IBM addressed this by sealing the disks, their individual arms, and motors within a dust-proof container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This not only resolved contamination but also increased storage capacity by allowing the read/write head to fly much closer to the disk surface—a thousandth of the distance compared to RAMAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The closer the head, the denser the data could be, cutting the cost-per-megabyte by 30% over competing designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The Winchester design became an industry standard, setting the blueprint for subsequent devices, and for a long time, HDDs were commonly referred to as "Winchester Drives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Shugart
Alan Shugart, who worked on the Winchester's early development, was born during the Great Depression and joined IBM's San Jose lab after graduating from the University of the Redlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. At IBM, Shugart led various memory projects, including a small, inexpensive read-only device for transferring programs between computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. IBM released it in 1973 as the "Type 1 Diskette," which is now known as the floppy disk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Shugart left IBM in 1969 after being transferred to New York against his wishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. He joined Memorex, a memory tape maker, for three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Afterward, he founded his own company, Shugart Associates, but left due to clashes with co-founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Shugart Associates later became a dominant force in the eight-inch and 5.25-inch commercial floppy drive markets and was acquired by Xerox in 1977 for $41 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Shugart 2
After leaving Shugart Associates, Alan Shugart pursued other interests before returning to the memory industry to found another company in Scotts Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:09:00]</a>. Initially named Shugart Technology, it was too similar to his previous company, so he renamed it Seagate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

With Seagate, Shugart aimed to adapt the [[Innovations and challenges in hard disk drive technology | IBM Winchester drive]] for the emerging microcomputer (PC) market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. PC-makers had adopted Shugart Associates' 5.25-inch floppy drive, which Dr. An Wang of Wang Laboratories had requested as a smaller, cheaper alternative to the original eight-inch floppy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Seagate developed a hard disk drive that fit the same space but offered significantly more capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

In 1980, Seagate announced their ST506 hard drive, which offered 5 megabytes of storage, far surpassing a floppy disk's 160 kilobytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Despite costing over $1,000, it was an immediate success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Seagate's revenues quickly grew from $9.8 million in 1981 to $40 million and then $110 million in subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Engineering Marvels
The core concept of HDDs, as seen in Seagate's 5.25-inch drive, remained similar to RAMAC, but the underlying engineering underwent a complete overhaul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. The four key sub-components are platters, motors, read-write heads, and supporting electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Data is stored on tracks on double-sided platters, now made from glass substrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Platters are mounted on spindles and spun by motors at 3,600 to 7,200 times per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Heads "fly" over the platters, positioned by actuators, to access data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Electronics monitor head movements and feed information back to the actuators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

Seagate's first 5-megabyte Winchester HDD was an engineering marvel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Doug Mahon, Seagate's engineering VP, compared it to a Boeing 747 flying at Mach 4 just an inch off the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Today, heads fly as little as 3 nanometers above the disk surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Producing these machines requires substantial capital expenditure for component sourcing, assembly in expensive cleanrooms, and rigorous testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Commoditization
Despite the advanced engineering, the market transformed HDDs into a commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Computer memory, especially secondary memory, is generally a commodity, and customers frequently seek more storage, often switching vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. "Brand value" never gained significant traction in the HDD industry; PC users upgrade for new Windows OS versions or Intel CPUs, not primarily for a new Seagate or Quantum HDD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Consequently, PC assemblers, notably IBM, leveraged competition among HDD makers to secure the lowest prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. IBM sourced almost all HDDs for its burgeoning PC business in the early 1980s from startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

In 1983, IBM released its PC-XT with a 10-megabyte HDD primarily sourced from startups like Seagate, MiniScribe, and IMI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. IBM demanded strict qualification programs and second-sourcing from suppliers, refusing long-term contracts due to the fast-moving market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

## Piling In
The HDD itself is a modular device with four precisely engineered, yet separate, components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Only two—the platters and read/write heads—directly contribute to storage capacity and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This modularity allowed new HDD firms to quickly tweak these critical parts, integrate improvements, and introduce new products to a market hungry for [[Innovations and challenges in hard disk drive technology | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

Furthermore, HDD firms initially did not protect their trade knowledge and [[Innovations and challenges in hard disk drive technology | innovations]] with patents, leading to free idea flow within the small community of HDD researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. When a firm created a successful new format or technology, competitors quickly developed their own, eroding any potential profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. For example, in 1983, Scottish firm Rodime patented the 3.5-inch HDD format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. However, it only gained substantial popularity in 1986 when Conner Peripherals sold it in large quantities to Compaq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. The format's popularity invited massive competition, and Rodime, unable to match competitors' scale, filed for bankruptcy twice in 1989 and 1991, eventually evolving into a patent troll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

Another example is Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR), a Nobel-winning quantum effect that revolutionized HDD read/write heads, enabling greater area density and storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Though discovered in Europe, IBM first commercialized GMR in 1997 with a 16.8 Gigabyte HDD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. American competitors Seagate and Read-Rite had their own GMR heads by 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, and Japanese companies like Toshiba rapidly licensed and acquired GMR technology, announcing their first GMR-equipped HDDs in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. One of Toshiba’s later products, a tiny 1.8-inch HDD, found its famous application in the Apple iPod in 2002, thanks to Steve Jobs and Jon Rubinstein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

## Venture Capital
This influx of new firms entering the market was heavily fueled by venture capital (VC) money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Changes in capital gains tax rates and pension fund investment regulations in the late 1970s facilitated the rise of VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

Seagate went public in September 1981, just over a year after launching their HDD, raising $26 million with a favorable market multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Seagate's VCs made significant returns; their $1 million investment was worth over $32 million after the IPO, setting a precedent for VC investment and exit strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. By mid-1983, 12 VC-backed HDD manufacturers were publicly traded with a total market cap of $5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. This hot market led VCs to raise large funds and invest heavily in the disk drive industry, recruiting talent from established companies to found new startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

From 1977 to 1984, 43 disk drive manufacturers raised $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. In 1983 and 1984 alone, 21 startups secured over $270 million across 51 funding rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. With approximately seventy firms in total by then, a pullback in the PC market in 1983-1984 triggered a massive shakeout, and many startups failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This "Zerg rush" of entrants dramatically reshaped the market. In 1978, old vertically integrated HDD companies held 84.8% of the market, but just over a decade later, their share plummeted to 7.9%, effectively driving them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

## Globalization
While US firms initially dominated the industry, competition emerged from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. Japanese and European companies entered the market, with the four major Japanese computer makers—Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC, and Toshiba—shifting from internal HDD production to an OEM model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Despite some [[Innovations and challenges in hard disk drive technology | interesting innovations]], they initially struggled to make significant market headway because American firms aggressively globalized their manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

In 1984, Seagate began outsourcing HDD assembly to Singapore, a move soon followed by several other American HDD makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. This was facilitated by the Singapore Government's Economic Development Board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. By 1990, Singapore became the world's largest HDD producer, holding a 55% share of shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. As labor costs in Singapore rose, lower-value work, such as assembling actuator arms, shifted to other Southeast Asian regions like Malaysia or Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Singaporeans, in turn, took on higher-value tasks like platter fabrication and specialized HDD system assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

The Japanese eventually caught up by also outsourcing their production abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. In the early 2000s, they even captured a majority share of the HDD market when Hitachi merged with IBM, though subsequent competition and mergers again eroded their advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

## Responses
The intense [[competitive_dynamics_and_market_saturation_in_the_hard_disk_drive_industry | competition]] and [[impact_of_globalization_on_the_hard_disk_drive_market | globalization]] greatly benefited consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. From 1976 to 1987, HDD data density increased by 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. The cost of a megabyte of data storage plummeted from $560 in 1977 to $11.89 in 1986, $6.86 by 1990, and a mere 4.3 cents by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

This unsustainable situation, coupled with maturing technology, led companies to exit the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. The number of HDD firms peaked at 66 in 1990, then halved to 33 over the next four years, with many failures including Peripheral Memories, Comport, PrarieTek, Priam, and Tulin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. By 1998, only 16 firms remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

Even after this brutal shakeout, the market still had too many players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. Between 2006 and 2015, the top four HDD vendors collectively held an average market share of only 52.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Consequently, four more major HDD firms—Quantum, IBM, Maxtor, and Fujitsu—exited the market between 2000 and 2010, as they were laggards and saw no way forward other than consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. Even IBM, the HDD's inventor, chose to exit; despite making money from patent-licensing, its HDD division struggled to exceed 25% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. In 2002, IBM merged its HDD operations with Hitachi's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## Conclusion
Today, three major HDD makers dominate the market: Seagate, Western Digital, and Toshiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. They continue to manage their market share as the HDD gradually fades, increasingly replaced by technologies like Solid State Drives (SSDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. While HDDs are unlikely to be entirely replaced, the significant growth and [[Innovations and challenges in hard disk drive technology | innovation]] that once defined the industry are largely gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

The aggressive [[impact_of_globalization_on_the_hard_disk_drive_market | globalization]] strategy of American firms allowed them to maintain substantial market share against Asian competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. By the mid-1990s, no HDD assembly factories remained in the United States, but higher-paying American jobs in R&D, head manufacturing, and gimbals were retained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

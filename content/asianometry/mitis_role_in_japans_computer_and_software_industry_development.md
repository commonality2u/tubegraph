Japan faced a digital trade deficit of approximately 5.5 trillion yen, or $37 billion, in 2023, indicating a significant import of software licenses, cloud, and other services compared to exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This deficit has doubled since 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Despite iconic electronics hardware companies like Sony, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Panasonic, Canon, Sharp, and Toshiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, Japan lacks a domestic equivalent to software giants such as Microsoft, Oracle, Adobe, or SAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This article explores how Japan "lost" the software industry, particularly examining the role of MITI.

## Beginnings

Throughout the 20th century, MITI (Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry), a now-famous economic policy ministry, actively sought to develop its computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Their primary competitor and "bogeyman" was IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. IBM first established a presence in Japan in 1925, selling tabulating machines through a local trading company, and later set up its own subsidiary, IBM Japan, in 1937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

After World War II, IBM returned to Japan in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. A new Japanese law in 1950 mandated that all foreign computer companies enter into joint ventures (JVs) with local companies, essentially forcing technology transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Examples included RCA with Hitachi, GE with Toshiba, and Honeywell with NEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, IBM refused to create a JV, maintaining 100% ownership of IBM Japan despite government demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

MITI and IBM Japan frequently clashed over which products could be introduced into the Japanese market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Even when IBM's computers were allowed, government officials pressured customers to buy local products and leveraged import licenses to enforce this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Despite these pressures, Japanese customers continued to favor IBM products due to their "clear technical superiority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Japan Software Company

In 1964, IBM introduced its breakthrough System/360 line of computers, alarming MITI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. In response, MITI sponsored the Super High-Performance Computer Project, which ran from 1966 to 1971, with the goal of surpassing the System/360 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Previous MITI efforts had focused entirely on computer hardware, including architecture and processor design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. However, since the System/360's key selling point was software compatibility across its line, software could no longer be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

To address the software component of the project, MITI sponsored the Japan Software Company (日本ソフトウェア) in October 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This was a joint venture between Hitachi, NEC, Fujitsu, and the Industrial Bank of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The company's objective was to produce "common language" software and common standards for the Super High-Performance Computer Project, essentially aiming for a universal operating system for all of Japan's computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

Despite this ambitious goal, MITI only funded Japan Software with 25% of the project's total 10 billion yen budget, indicating that software was an afterthought for the ministry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The Japan Software Company failed to achieve its goals due to "ballooning requirements from so many participants" and a lack of outside sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. After government subsidies ended, the company closed in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Unbundling and "Little IBMs"

A major turning point in technology industrial history occurred in 1969 when IBM, facing the threat of an American antitrust lawsuit, unbundled its software and hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Previously, software was included as part of an overall computing services bundle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This unbundling assigned a price to software that was once free, allowing small software companies to compete against giants like IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. In the United States, this created the software industry as we know it today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

In Japan, however, a different outcome emerged. [[impact_of_ibm_unbundling_on_japanese_software_industry | IBM's unbundling]] allowed Japanese computer-makers to set up software subsidiaries and "adopt" IBM's specifications through reverse-engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. As early as 1971, Fujitsu began selling an "IBM-compatible" mainframe that was marketed as faster and cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Japanese companies often modified the software to display Japanese kanji symbols and for customers' existing business practices, which helped them lock in customers and charge more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This led to Japanese computer companies effectively becoming "little IBMs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## The IBM Spy Case

This widespread use of reverse-engineered IBM software by Japanese companies was illegal, but IBM did little about it for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Software copyright protections were not definitively extended until the Copyright Act of 1976, which took effect in 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Furthermore, IBM was preoccupied with defending itself against a massive antitrust case in the US, which sought to break it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This antitrust case concluded in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

With the antitrust case resolved, IBM turned its attention to the ongoing theft of its software by Japanese companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. In 1982, IBM confronted Fujitsu, Hitachi, and others with allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. These companies argued that the System/360 OS was in the public domain when they adopted it, allowing them to use derived software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. They also claimed IBM's software specifications were so widely used they constituted a standard, thus not subject to copyright protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

IBM then involved the US government, leading to the "IBM Spy Case" in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Eighteen Japanese employees, some senior, from Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric, were arrested in a sting operation and charged with stealing technical secrets from IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This case created tension between the US and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

Ultimately, Japanese computer firms were found to have copied IBM's work, including errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Fujitsu agreed to a settlement, paying a one-time lump sum and annual licensing fees as high as $60 million, and committed to respecting IBM's intellectual property rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. These software fees severely threatened the competitiveness of Japanese computer-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

In response, MITI attempted to amend Japan's copyright laws in 1985 to limit software protections from the international standard of 50 years to just 15 years, a proposal that ultimately failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This demonstrated the seriousness of the situation, as Japanese computer companies had built their businesses on closed-source foreign software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## The Japanese Software Crisis and Programmer Shortage

MITI recognized a significant "[[challenges_in_japanese_software_talent_and_startups | software crisis]]" in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Without domestic alternatives, Japanese tech providers would remain dependent on software imports from companies like IBM or Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

A major obstacle was a persistent shortage of qualified, productive software programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Reasons included:
*   **Lack of qualified educators**: Japanese universities lacked enough qualified computer science and software teachers, with most professors trained in other disciplines like math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Teachers also lagged in adopting the latest compute trends in their curriculums, partly due to a lack of English bilingual abilities and overseas experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Unattractive career prospects**: Software engineering was not considered an attractive job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The largest employers were software development arms of larger business families (likely related to [[zaibatsu_and_japanese_economy | zaibatsu]]), operating on a lifetime employment system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Developers lacked customer interaction and career progression, often engaging in "boring customization or maintenance code-monkeying" that was not well-paying or fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. As late as 2010, 80% of Japan's software spending went to maintaining existing systems, compared to no more than 60% in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Lack of software startups**: Unlike the US, where independent software giants like Adobe, Intuit, Synopsys, Cadence, Lotus, Electronic Arts, Microsoft, and Oracle emerged in the 1970s and 80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, such companies failed to emerge in Japan during the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This was attributed to a lack of customer acceptance, insufficient venture capital investment, an unwieldy lifetime employment system, and a cultural lack of initiative or risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## MITI's Later Initiatives: BTRON & SIGMA

A relevant issue was the lack of a good "software environment" for Japanese programmers, as the industry worked on custom software without a widely accepted platform or operating system independent of hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

*   **BTRON**: One possible solution was TRON, a domestic OS project initiated in 1984 by Dr. Ken Sakamura of the University of Tokyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. TRON aimed to create an "open" operating system to challenge Microsoft's software and Intel's hardware dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. It provided interfaces and design guidelines rather than source code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. The Business TRON (BTRON) variant was adopted by PC makers like Matsushita Electric for use in Japanese schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. However, in April 1989, the US Trade Representative office listed BTRON as a potential Japanese trade barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Although the mention was later removed, [[effects_of_international_competition_and_policies_on_japans_software_market | Japanese microprocessor companies]], already embroiled in the US-Japan [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | semiconductor kerfuffle]], pulled out, causing BTRON to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **SIGMA & Unix**: In 1985, MITI sponsored another consortium, the five-year Software Industrialized Generators and Maintenance Aids (SIGMA) project, funded with 25 billion yen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. SIGMA's goal was to drastically improve programmer productivity by developing standards, configurations, and applications for networked Unix workstation computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. While SIGMA fell short of its ultimate goals, it did facilitate Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC's transition from IBM platforms to Unix (licensed from AT&T), though they heavily customized it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. This gave Japanese mainframe and supercomputer companies a "second wind," leading Japan to produce some of the world's fastest supercomputers in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

## The 1990s and Shifting Strategies

The popping of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1990 led to a prolonged recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Customers could no longer afford expensive software modifications, causing a slow decline for major Japanese mainframe makers like Fujitsu and Hitachi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. The economic downturn also eroded Japanese confidence, and the US began to pull ahead based on its competitive advantages in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

MITI's traditional playbook, which had worked for industrial items like steel or automobiles (giving domestic champions money and a popular product to reverse-engineer, then export), proved ineffective for software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Software's success depends not on "replication economics" but on widely held standards, networks of applications or users, and consumer familiarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. As consumer products became more reliant on operating software, Japan's mighty consumer companies struggled to compete in the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

*   **PC-98**: The PC market illustrates this failure. For over a decade, NEC dominated the domestic PC market with its PC-98, which used a hardware-accelerated version of MS-DOS capable of handling Japanese language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. However, in the early 1990s, IBM, Microsoft, and Intel introduced a new version of DOS with Japanese language support, opening the door for foreign-made software and hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This time, the Japanese government and MITI allowed the market to play out, recognizing the need for a more globalized approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. NEC's overpriced products crumbled, cementing Microsoft's dominance in the Japanese market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **I-Mode**: A similar pattern emerged with NTT DoCoMo's "I-mode" mobile internet service, launched in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Despite its domestic popularity, [[effects_of_international_competition_and_policies_on_japans_software_market | I-mode failed to gain traction abroad]], partly due to a lack of adoption by handset partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>, and its window of opportunity closed with the release of the iPhone and its rich application ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

In conclusion, while Japan possesses a large software industry, its landscape remains dominated by custom-made packages with limited broader sales potential, or by imported products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. Despite MITI's extensive industrial policies over decades, Japan's strongest area in software remains gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. The continued lag in the global software industry remains a point of discussion, with few clear policy answers on how to fix it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

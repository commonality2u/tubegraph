From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

At its peak, Daewoo Group was South Korea's fourth-largest business conglomerate, alongside Hyundai, Samsung, and LG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The company experienced rapid growth due to a favorable political environment and significant [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. However, within a two-year period, the entire group disintegrated under the weight of its [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | liabilities]], a severe recession, and widespread [[impact_and_aftermath_of_daewoos_accounting_fraud | fraud]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Daewoo's collapse damaged the reputation of its founder and chairman, Kim Woo-jung, who had to leave the country until he received a pardon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Founder's Background: Kim Woo-jung

Kim Woo-jung was born in 1936, the fourth of six children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. His father was the principal of Daegu Normal School, which was the primary school of future South Korean President Park Chung-hee, and later became the governor of Jeju Island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Kim's father was abducted during the Korean War and never returned, leaving the family to support themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

After the Korean War, Kim moved from Daegu to Seoul and studied economics at Yonsei University, one of Korea's elite institutions, graduating in 1960 at age 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. He then worked for six years at a textile trade and export company founded by a relative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Founding and Early Success

In 1967, at age 30, Kim founded his own textiles trading company, Daewoo Industrial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. It began modestly with just $18,000 and four employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The name "Daewoo" (대우) literally means "great universe" in Chinese characters, reflecting the founder's grand ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Through persistence, Kim convinced American department stores like Sears, J.C. Penney, and Montgomery Ward to sell his textiles by 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. A crucial piece of information helped secure his sales position: American customers informed him that the U.S. government planned to impose a quota on textile imports, with foreign suppliers receiving a percentage based on their current market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Daewoo strategically sacrificed both profits and product quality to gain as much market share as possible before the quota was imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This "ballsy gambit" succeeded, and in 1972, Daewoo was awarded 30% of the quota, instantly propelling the company to its first major financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. By its fourth year, Daewoo had exported over $4 million in textile goods, becoming Korea's second-largest exporter and establishing a de facto monopoly that provided cash flow for future [[daewoos_business_strategy_and_global_expansion | expansions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Diversification and [[daewoos_business_strategy_and_global_expansion | Global Expansion]]

Throughout the 1960s, President Park Chung-hee's administration focused on boosting exports and capacity in strategic industries, offering favorable loans and funding to companies that followed their lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Daewoo was one such company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. In 1973, after securing its lucrative textile quota, Daewoo expanded into new industries such as machinery, shipbuilding, construction, and automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. These [[daewoos_business_strategy_and_global_expansion | expansions]] often involved acquisitions and joint ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Daewoo excelled at turnarounds, demonstrating relentless perseverance and a high appetite for risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. For example:
*   In 1976, Daewoo acquired struggling industrial machinery manufacturer Hankook Machinery, renaming it Daewoo Heavy Industries, which became profitable in its second year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   In 1978, Daewoo acquired Okpo Shipbuilding, which was merged into Daewoo Heavy Industries and made a profit five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

Daewoo's [[daewoos_business_strategy_and_global_expansion | business strategy]] mirrored its textile approach: prioritizing market share over profits through high volume and low prices, with little focus on brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. They rarely prioritized upgrading technologies or moving into more valuable market segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. In line with government preferences, Daewoo focused heavily on exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Kim traveled extensively, 260 days a year, selling Daewoo goods primarily in emerging countries in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Government Ties and the Chaebol System

Daewoo's rapid rise was significantly intertwined with its relationship with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Founder Kim's personal ties to Park Chung-hee, whose primary school principal was Kim's father, were beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The company also frequently hired government elites and retired state bankers as executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. These [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | close ties]] enabled Daewoo to secure highly favorable loans at interest rates of 6-9%, at a time when annual inflation reached 40% and private banks charged much higher rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

These benefits, which included preferential loans, monopoly protections, favorable labor laws, and silent backing, came with obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The chaebol (large family-controlled business conglomerates), including Daewoo, followed government guidance and contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to presidential slush funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Externally, Chairman Kim was celebrated as a world-famous businessman who "spun gold wherever he went" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. He was profiled in international business magazines and elected chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. His 1989 autobiography, "Every Street is Paved with Gold," became a bestseller, selling over 2 million copies and translated into 21 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Ownership Structure
Initially, Daewoo's core holding company was privately owned by the founder and his family, a common practice for Korean chaebol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. However, in the 1970s, the Korean government mandated that chaebol take their holding companies public to bring liquidity to the stock markets and allow public participation in economic success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Although reluctant due to their reliance on bank funding, Daewoo and other chaebol complied after the government protected family control by curbing certain shareholder rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

To maintain control, the family established complex cross-ownership structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This allowed them to dilute their economic shares by offering stock to the public while retaining total control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. By 1997, Kim and his family owned, on average, only 6.1% of shares in Daewoo Group companies, but with subsidiaries owning about 30% of each other, Kim controlled an average of 38.3% of the votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This meant no shareholder group could challenge him, even as his decision-making became increasingly erratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The chaebol's complex structure and interdependencies (Daewoo companies often only used each other's services) made it difficult to assess profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This was not a major concern as long as the government was expected to provide bailouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Challenges and Changing Landscape

By 1979, Daewoo Group owned 41 companies and was South Korea's largest exporter, just 12 years after its founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The late 1970s brought two significant developments:
*   **Entry into the Car Business:** In 1978, Daewoo partnered with GM Korea to acquire 50% of Sehan Motor, a company dating back to the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Daewoo gained full control in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Daewoo Motors applied the same [[daewoos_business_strategy_and_global_expansion | playbook]] of low prices and low quality, with minimal focus on R&D and technical upgrading, which strained the company's finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Assassination of Park Chung-hee:** The death of President Park marked significant shifts in Korea's regulatory and economic climate, putting Daewoo Group on less stable ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. While Daewoo maintained [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | close political ties]], subsequent governments opened markets to foreign competition, and cheap loans began to diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

The 1980s presented new challenges to Daewoo's low-price, low-quality [[daewoos_business_strategy_and_global_expansion | strategy]]:
*   **Currency Appreciation:** The South Korean won began appreciating, making exports more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Rising Labor Wages:** Korean labor wages increased with improved living conditions, making the production of cheap goods more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Protective Trade Barriers:** Other countries adopted barriers to favor domestic players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **China's Emergence:** China began opening up, with its exporters adopting similar low-cost strategies, competing directly with companies like Daewoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

Daewoo recognized the need to adapt, but its approach remained inconsistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## The 1988 Shipyard Crisis and Moral Hazard

In 1988, Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery, which owned the country's second-largest shipyard, faced near-bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Years of high [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] usage and a focus on revenues over sales led to its decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. By 1988, Daewoo carried approximately $1.8 billion in [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] (in 1988 USD) and struggled with difficult market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

Daewoo sought a government bailout, which was widely expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Kim argued that he had taken on the shipyard at Park Chung-hee's request and that the Korea Development Bank had promised but failed to deliver the full amount of equity injection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Even shipyard employees expected a bailout, striking for and negotiating significant wage increases (25-55% annually) in the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The government ultimately bailed out Daewoo Shipbuilding in 1989, providing 200 billion Korean won in preferential loans and directly injecting another 50 billion won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This rescue reaffirmed Daewoo's [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | closeness to the government]] even after Park's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

This event should have been a turning point, and Kim seemed to realize the need for change, announcing a company initiative in 1990 to improve product quality across all Daewoo companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Initial successes included an 80% decline in shipbuilding defect rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. However, these initiatives lacked sustained commitment, as Kim never fully embraced them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. The concept of moral hazard, where individuals take excessive risks knowing they won't bear all the consequences, applied to Daewoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

## Automotive Obsession and Reckless [[daewoos_business_strategy_and_global_expansion | Expansion]]

Instead of focusing on quality, Kim plunged into his "most intoxicating and costly obsession": cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. In 1992, Daewoo Group acquired full control of its motor subsidiary, which was unprofitable, losing $200 million in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Nevertheless, Daewoo Motors embarked on a massive buying spree to become a global automotive leader, likely funded by the 1989 bailout money given to Daewoo Shipbuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   In 1994, Daewoo Motors acquired a technical center in the UK and started a joint venture in Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   In 1996, Daewoo spent $1.8 billion to purchase a Polish car company and a truck factory, making Daewoo the country's second-largest automaker after Fiat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
*   They opened an $800 million car plant in Uzbekistan, capable of producing 200,000 cars annually for sale in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   Subsequent acquisitions included a Czech truck manufacturer and joint ventures in Ukraine and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   In total, Daewoo purchased 14 car factories in 13 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

Many of these ventures failed, but the company refused to withdraw, believing in their growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. For example, they were losing $30 million a year in India and sold only 423 cars in Vietnam in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. The "cherry on top" was a majority takeover of the struggling SsangYong Motor Company in January 1998, at the peak of the [[impact_of_financial_crises_on_south_korean_business_practices | Asian Financial Crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## Financial Vulnerability: The [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | Role of Debt]]

All chaebol used [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]], with an average debt-to-equity ratio of 400% throughout the 1980s and 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. However, Daewoo not only carried the most [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] (over $11 billion into the 1990s) but was also the most structurally vulnerable to [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Unlike other chaebol structured around a profitable "cash cow" core company (like Samsung Electronics), Daewoo's core company, Daewoo Corporation, was a trading and financial entity that prioritized revenues over profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. It funded its subsidiaries through borrowings, meaning Daewoo operated on thin ice without a strong cash generator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

The market had long suspected Daewoo's precarious financial state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. In April 1997, just before the [[impact_of_financial_crises_on_south_korean_business_practices | Asian Financial Crisis]], Daewoo had the lowest price-to-book ratio among Korea's top chaebol, at 1.12, compared to Samsung's 6 and Hyundai's 3.66 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## The [[impact_of_financial_crises_on_south_korean_business_practices | Asian Financial Crisis]] and Collapse

1997 marked the beginning of a two-year period leading to Daewoo's insolvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Late that year, the Korean won plunged from 901 to 1961 against the U.S. dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. Korea received a large, controversial bailout from international entities, and the economy shrank nearly 7% the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

While other chaebol scaled back, Daewoo continued its reckless expansion, discounting products and acquiring new companies, including the purchase of SsangYong in January 1998, which added even more [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. Throughout 1998, despite its considerable existing [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]], Daewoo managed to raise another $14.1 billion, becoming the nation's most indebted company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. In the third quarter alone, they added another 40% in [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Investors likely believed the Korean government would eventually bail them out, and discussions with the government had been ongoing since June 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. However, the government insisted on austerity measures that Daewoo, led by empire-builder Chairman Kim, was unwilling to adopt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

Late in 1998, the Korean government recognized the contagion risk of a Daewoo [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. They instructed financial institutions to limit Daewoo Group [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] to 5% of their portfolios, effectively cutting off Daewoo's lines of credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Kim had been confident the government would ease chaebol reform and bail out Daewoo again, but once the credit faucet was turned off, the situation became critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

That December, the company finally agreed to downsize, consolidating 51 operating companies into 10 and committing to reduce its [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] ratio from 500% over 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Nomura Securities published a report titled "Alarm Bells Ringing for Daewoo Group" late in 1998, highlighting [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. However, the market, banks, and government were slow to react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. The December 1998 "restructuring" lacked enforcement; creditor banks failed to withdraw funding when Daewoo missed quarterly [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] reduction targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Rumors of last-minute deals, like swapping Daewoo Electronics for Samsung Motors or intervention from a Saudi prince or the incoming president, helped perpetuate the delusion that Daewoo would survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. By mid-1999, it was clear Daewoo was not meeting its [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] reduction goals and was heading for default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. Credit rating agencies belatedly downgraded Daewoo's [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

## The [[impact_and_aftermath_of_daewoos_accounting_fraud | Accounting Fraud]]

By the end of 1998, Daewoo was already a bankrupt entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. For the 1998 year, the company reported 25% higher sales but a half-trillion Korean won profit loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Management attributed this loss to one-off situations involving Daewoo Telecom, Daewoo Corporation, and Daewoo Heavy Industries, claiming core companies were generating hundreds of millions in profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

However, these profits were generated through a scheme of fictitious overseas asset sales between sister subsidiaries at inflated prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. For example, Subsidiary A would sell an asset like a tractor to Subsidiary B at an unreasonable price, with B paying in stock or another asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. This swap allowed Subsidiary A to record false profit directly from the sale and revalue all its other assets to the new, inflated price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. Without these asset swaps and other [[impact_and_aftermath_of_daewoos_accounting_fraud | fraudulent practices]], Daewoo's loss was not half a trillion won but actually four trillion won, or eight times that amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. Other estimates put the [[impact_and_aftermath_of_daewoos_accounting_fraud | fraud]] in 1997 and 1998 as high as 23 trillion won (about $19 billion), making it Korea's largest [[impact_and_aftermath_of_daewoos_accounting_fraud | accounting fraud]] at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. Regardless of the exact scale, the company was insolvent, with far more [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | liabilities]] than assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

## The Final Gambit and Bankruptcy

In July 1999, Kim attempted one final maneuver, publicly announcing he would put up all his personal wealth as collateral and resign from all positions except Daewoo Motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. He promised to make Daewoo Motors profitable and then retire, in return for creditors injecting another four trillion won (approximately $3.4 billion) into the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. Daewoo would then find another $9 billion in collateral to save the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

On August 1999, Kim was removed from his companies, and the subsidiaries were placed into bankruptcy to be sold off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. At its collapse, Daewoo owed over $50 billion in [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] to 140 banks in over 100 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Kim fled the country in November 1999, living in exile for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. Upon his return, he was tried, fined heavily, and received a ten-year prison sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Less than a year later, he received a presidential pardon and died in 2019 at age 82 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.

## Aftermath and Legacy

The collapse of Daewoo had significant repercussions:
*   **Financial Sector Impact:** Banks and insurance companies lost trillions of won from Daewoo's [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]], forcing the Korean government to inject public money to prevent further collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.
*   **Reforms:** The event led to extensive reforms in investor transparency and banking oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.
*   **Accounting Industry:** Considering the scale of the [[impact_and_aftermath_of_daewoos_accounting_fraud | fraud]], accountants should have raised alarms but did not, likely due to their powerful clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. Several accountants were fined and had their licenses suspended, leading to reforms in the Korean accounting industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
*   **Missing Funds:** While the [[impact_and_aftermath_of_daewoos_accounting_fraud | fraud]] was extensively documented, an estimated $750 million to $4 billion remains missing from the company's coffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. Some of this money may have been used for personal expenses, such as a $2.5 million donation to Harvard for Kim's son, or paid to the government as [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | bribes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

Today, former Daewoo companies operate independently, though some may still bear the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. Few companies have grown as fast as Daewoo, and hopefully, few will implode as spectacularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.

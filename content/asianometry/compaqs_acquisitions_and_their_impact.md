Compaq's early years saw "insane growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> driven by breakthrough products, speed, and strong dealer relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>. However, by the mid-1990s, increasing competition, particularly from Dell's direct-selling model, put immense pressure on Compaq's margins and market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. This led CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer to believe that Compaq needed to grow beyond mere PCs to become a global computer company offering services, similar to IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. His vision was to transform Compaq into a $50 billion company by the year 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, which ultimately led to a "series of unfortunate acquisitions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.

## Networking Acquisitions

Compaq spent "substantial money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:34">[00:23:34]</a> to build a networking business aimed at challenging Cisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. This strategy included:
*   **Networth** In late 1995, Compaq acquired Networth, a company specializing in networking gear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.
*   **Microcom** In May 1997, Compaq acquired another networking company called Microcom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

## Tandem Computer Incorporated

In June 1997, Compaq paid $4 billion to acquire Tandem Computer Incorporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. Tandem's expertise was in highly fault-tolerant computers, essential for companies requiring "rock-solid 24/7 service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>, such as ATM networks and process control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Their computers featured many redundant parts, making them complex to program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

## Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)

Less than a year after acquiring Tandem, in late January 1998, Pfeiffer orchestrated the acquisition of the iconic Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for a record $9.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. This was the largest computer company acquisition to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

### DEC's Background and Assets
DEC, founded in the late 1950s, was renowned for inventing the minicomputer category with the PDP-11 and VAX 11/780 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. Its technology and R&D prowess were legendary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>. Acquiring DEC, with its $13 billion in revenues, transformed Compaq into a $38 billion giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

Analysts largely approved of the deal, acknowledging that DEC was available due to struggles in its core high-end Internet server and workstation businesses against "disruptive competition" from cheap and powerful Unix computers like those from [[the_decline_and_acquisition_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

The upsides of the acquisition included:
*   **Cash and Tax Assets** DEC held $2 billion in cash and $3 billion in tax loss assets, which could offset the purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.
*   **Services and Customer Relationships** DEC's worldwide services businesses and customer relationships continued to generate "significant money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   **Technical Assets** DEC possessed its own Unix variant and an in-house 64-bit RISC microprocessor called Alpha, which was "fairly fast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. However, DEC never fully utilized Alpha and phased it out for x86 architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.
*   **AltaVista** DEC also owned AltaVista, a major search engine in the early Dotcom era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. Compaq had a vague notion of selling PCs through the site but did little with it, eventually selling it to KPMG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.

### Integration Challenges and Impact
Despite these potential benefits, Pfeiffer struggled to bridge the two company cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. There was "little push to capitalize on DEC's considerable technology assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>, which remained largely unused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

Simultaneously, Compaq's core PC business continued to deteriorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. It was not until 1998 that Compaq finally began adopting Dell's direct-sales model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:09">[00:26:09]</a> to close Dell's 10-15% cost advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. However, this move was "too little, too late" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.

## End of Pfeiffer's Tenure

In April 1999, Eckhard Pfeiffer was fired by the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. The reasoning was that he had "lost his touch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>, being "too driven on hitting a revenue number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>, and his "expensive acquisition spree" coupled with his "inability to integrate said acquisitions" ended his tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. Chairman Ben Rosen later stated he wished he had fired Pfeiffer a year earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.

Michael Capellas, Compaq's Chief Information Officer, was chosen as the new CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. While Capellas worked to improve expenses and gross margins, the company's finances remained lackluster, and the core PC business continued to "melt away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. In September 1999, Dell surpassed Compaq as the leading PC seller in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.

## Conclusion

Compaq's aggressive acquisition strategy, particularly under Eckhard Pfeiffer, was an attempt to diversify beyond the commoditizing PC market and become a broader IT services company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. However, the inability to effectively integrate these acquisitions, capitalize on their assets, and simultaneously address the eroding core PC business ultimately led to Pfeiffer's dismissal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:32">[00:26:32]</a> and the continued decline of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. This challenging period set the stage for Compaq to explore a merger, eventually leading to its [[Merger with Hewlett Packard | acquisition by Hewlett-Packard]] in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.

At the time of Japan's opening, most of the world's watches originated from either the United States or Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While the Swiss initially tried to guard their watchmaking secrets, these eventually disseminated, leading to Japan becoming a major watch manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Early Watch and Clock Market

At the turn of the 20th century, the global watch market was split between the United States and Switzerland, though their success models differed significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. American companies like Waltham Watch and Elgin Watch focused on mass-producing simple, cheap pocket watches for domestic consumption, utilizing screw automation technology adapted from sewing machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Conversely, the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss watch industry]] comprised many small firms producing a wide array of high-precision timepieces, generally considered more high-class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. In 1901, Swiss statistics recorded 663 watch industry firms employing 24,858 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Longines, the largest Swiss company, employed only 853 people and produced 130,000 pieces in 1905, significantly less than Waltham's annual output a few years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Swiss diversity and export focus led to a 93% market share in pocket watch exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Japan rapidly adopted Western technologies for modernization, including railroads, telegraphs, and military advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. When Westerners first imported watches into Japan in the 1860s, they were luxury items for the social elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. In 1868, Japan imported 1,185 wall clocks and only 300 pocket watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. By 1887, over 700,000 clocks were imported, installed in hospitals, schools, town halls, and post offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Rise of Domestic Clock Manufacturing

Japan aimed to reduce reliance on clock imports from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Given that clocks were technologically simpler than watches, the early Japanese industry focused on replicating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. In 1888, Hayashi Shii, a timepiece retailer, opened Japan's first modern clock factory, which was successful and led to five more factories in Osaka, Tokyo, and other cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Japan's clock industry quickly gained manufacturing competence, with production rising from 37,460 pieces in 1905 to 1.2 million in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. By the eve of World War I, there were over 20 clock factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Initially, domestic and military demand drove the market, but Hayashi began exporting excess production to Far East cities like Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Bombay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. By the 1930s, Japan was a leading clock exporter, holding 35% of the total market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Emergence of Japanese Watchmakers

As pocket watches grew in popularity, Japanese companies sought to produce them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. In 1887, only 0.8% of Japanese regularly wore watches; this increased to 4.2% by 1897 and 10% by 1907 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The most prominent Japanese watch company was Hattori & Co., founded by Hattori Kintaro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Kintaro learned the watch industry at 13, opened his own repair and resale shop at 17 in 1877, and by 1881, was selling imported Swiss and American watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Recognizing the Japanese clock boom, Hattori opened his own factory in 1895, making wall clocks and high-end grandfather clocks, which he named Seikosha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Challenges and Protectionism

Japanese watches initially struggled to compete with Swiss and American companies, being less thin, accurate, or reliable, and costing more than imported competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This was partly due to low sales quantities preventing Japanese factories from achieving economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Western imports flowed freely into Japan due to an unequal treaty signed in the mid-1800s, which opened several treaty ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

However, in 1899, the treaty lapsed, and Japan regained sovereignty over its trade relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The Japanese government immediately implemented an [[role_of_tariffs_and_trade_policies_in_watch_industry | import substitution policy]], raising tariffs to deter imports and protect domestic manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. For instance, tariffs on silver and nickel watch imports rose from 5% before 1899 to 25%, and then 40% in 1906 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Similar actions were taken for bicycles, machine tools, hydroelectric turbines, and automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Hattori's (Seiko) Growth and the "Shablon" Strategy

Protected from Western imports, Hattori's watchmaking business flourished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. From 1906 to 1930, his clocks captured 48% of the domestic market, and his watches, 85% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Government protection and high tariffs were significant factors, but Hattori also improved manufacturing by automating a small number of select Swiss-inspired models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Out of 25 watch types released between 1895 and 1937, only three sold well: the 1909 Empire pocket watch, and two wristwatches, the Laurel and the Seiko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

To gain expertise, Hattori hired engineering labor from Tokyo universities to disassemble and reassemble Swiss watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Crucially, he sourced raw watch parts from Switzerland, which were not subject to tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. From 1915 to 1935, Switzerland supplied 69% of Japan's watch parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This practice of importing disassembled watch movement sets (shablon) and assembling them within Japan was a key strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Imports of watch movements significantly increased after the tariffs on finished watches were imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, with Japan importing far more movements than finished watches by 1905 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Swiss Concerns and the Rise of Citizen Watch

The [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss watch industry]] grew concerned that shablon would lead to their long-term downfall by transferring critical watchmaking expertise to other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. An example is Rudolph Schmidt, a Swiss citizen who settled in Yokohama in 1894 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. His trading company initially imported complete watches but shifted to importing shablon into Japan after tariff increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. At his workshop in Yokohama, Schmidt finished watches with cases imported from his family's Swiss factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. By 1910, Schmidt moved the entire process, including case making, to Japan, infuriating the Swiss watch industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. His company grew significantly after moving to Tokyo in 1912 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. In 1930, Schmidt acquired a watchmaking workshop named Shosha, which was renamed the Citizen Watch Company, a name Schmidt had owned since 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Citizen would become the second most significant Japanese watchmaker after Hattori (Seiko) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Swiss Response

By 1935, Hattori's watch factory became the single largest in the world, and both Hattori and Citizen began expanding abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Japanese watch advertisements touted the "extraordinary aptitude" and "exceptional output" of Japanese workers for fine, painstaking work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. With watch exports declining through the 1920s, the Swiss reorganized their industry into a cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Part suppliers signed "watchmaking conventions" to only do business with each other, and a holding company named ASUAG was set up to acquire movement manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. By 1934, the Swiss government controlled all watchmaking activities and monitored exports of watch parts and machine tools, making shablon illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. These measures helped the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss watch industry]] maintain high profits and a consistent 50% global market share for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

## Transition to Wristwatches and World War II

The 1930s saw a market [[transition_from_mechanical_to_quartz_watches | transition from pocket watches to wristwatches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Watches gained new features like self-winding movements, calendars, and waterproof cases, becoming smaller and more complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. During World War II, most watch companies, except for the neutral Swiss, halted production and diverted materials for the war effort, often producing precision tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Swiss neutrality gave them a significant advantage in the post-war global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. American watch companies struggled post-war against cheap Swiss imports, entering a long-term decline despite new tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

Hattori & Co. (Seiko) pushed hard to recover from the post-war slump and compete with the Swiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. They copied Swiss machine tools, studied Swiss methods, and exploited loopholes in the cartel system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. By 1966, Hattori produced mechanical watches that matched Swiss performance, establishing themselves as world leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## The Quartz Revolution

At the same time, Seiko sought to develop a new type of watch that would revolutionize the mechanical watch world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The principles of quartz technology had existed for a long time; Pierre Curie discovered in the 1880s that applying pressure or alternating current to a quartz crystal causes it to vibrate consistently at about 33,000 times per second, which could be used for highly accurate timepieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. In 1927, a Bell Labs engineer created a room-sized, high-precision quartz clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

In 1960, Bulova, one of the two major remaining American watchmakers, launched the Accutron, the first commercial electronic watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. While not quartz-powered, it used a 360 Hz tuning fork and was 10 times more accurate than mechanical watches with fewer discrete parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Developed by Swiss scientist Max Hetzel, the Accutron was unveiled with a large marketing campaign across 13 US cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Bulova, however, suffered from a first-mover disadvantage by sticking to tuning fork technology even as quartz emerged as the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Nevertheless, the Accutron spurred a wave of [[impact_of_technological_advancements_in_watches | technological development in electronic watches]] in the US, Japan, and Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

In 1959, Hattori (now Seiko) formed a team to commercialize quartz timekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. With the advent of transistors, small circuits could power quartz crystals, measure oscillations, and translate them into second pulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Their initial goal was a portable quartz chronometer for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, which they successfully delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Subsequently, they aimed to miniaturize the technology into a wristwatch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Without access to advanced integrated circuits, they created a hand-soldered hybrid circuit using 76 transistors, 29 condensers, and 84 resistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. Seiko outsourced some production to American firm Interel, who then transferred process knowledge to Seiko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

The Seiko Astron SQ went on sale in Tokyo on Christmas Day 1969 for the equivalent of $31,000 today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. This elegant, limited-edition gold watch heralded a revolution, with Seiko marketing it with the line, "Someday all watches will be made this way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Despite its revolutionary nature, initial sales were slow, with only 3,000 Astron digital watches sold by 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

## Digital Quartz Dominance

Meanwhile, Hamilton Watch in Pennsylvania developed their own quartz watch using light-emitting diodes (LEDs), completely replacing hands and dials with a digital time and date display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Hamilton's "Pulsar," marketed as a "wrist computer," was first released as a luxury gold P1 version to offset high production costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Its popularity soared when James Bond wore a P2 version in "Live and Let Die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

By the mid-1970s, LED quartz watches became the market standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. In 1974, global consumers bought 650,000 LED watches, with analysts predicting a rise to 10 million in a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. LED watches eventually gave way to LCD watches due to better battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Various integrated circuit firms and traditional watch companies rushed into the digital quartz watch category, seeking a "killer app" for their chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Texas Instruments sold digital solid-state LED watches in the same retail outlets as their calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. Even Intel briefly ventured into the watch market, acquiring digital watchmaker Microma in 1972 and producing smartwatches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. Casio, initially a calculator company, competed with US firm Timex at the low end, offering inexpensive models in drugstores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

Japanese watch exports to the United States, a crucial market for the Swiss, exploded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. Export value grew nearly tenfold, reaching $26 million USD in 1975, with watches accounting for almost 20% of total Japanese exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Swiss exports stagnated, and their market share plummeted from 83% in the early 1970s to just 20% by 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. By 1985, Japanese watch exports to the US totaled $373 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. Seiko, Citizen, and Casio effectively displaced the Swiss from their most valuable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

### Impact on the Swiss Watch Industry

While Japanese mechanical watches were on par with Swiss watches before the Astron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>, the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss watch industry]] significantly mishandled the shift to quartz, despite being aware of the technology and even demoing their own prototypes in 1967, two years before the Astron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. The Swiss took pride in their mechanical heritage, and their fragmented industry structure of many small firms hindered a coordinated shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. No single Swiss company possessed the resources or broad expertise to develop a quartz watch on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

A digital watch made with modern semiconductor production methods overwhelmed the painstaking effort and artisan skill required for mechanical watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Quartz watches ended the Swiss dominance of the global watch industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. As late as 1974, they held 40% of the global market, but that share shrank to just 10% ten years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. By 1983, over half of Switzerland's watchmakers had gone bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. The Swiss were forced to adopt quartz technologies, and for a period, it seemed mechanical watch production techniques might be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Swiss Comeback and Japanese Stagnation

The [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss mechanical watch industry]] has since made a comeback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Recognizing their products' value beyond just accurate timekeeping, they restructured into the Swatch Group, created luxury watch brands, and have since thrived in their niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

The Japanese watch industry, however, peaked in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. Challenged by industrial competitors in Hong Kong and China, the industry stagnated and relocated manufacturing abroad, struggling to return to its glory years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

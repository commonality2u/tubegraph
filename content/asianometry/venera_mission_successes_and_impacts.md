The [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Soviet Union's Venera program]] achieved a remarkable feat by successfully landing five probes on the surface of Venus in the 1970s and 1980s, with each lander surviving for over 30 minutes in the planet's incredibly hostile environment. No nation has attempted a similar landing since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The achievement of taking and transmitting pictures from Venus remains a significant milestone in space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Challenges of Venusian Exploration

Venus presents immense [[challenges_of_landing_on_venus | challenges for landing]] due to its extreme conditions, making it arguably the second hardest place to land in the Solar System after the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Often called "Earth's evil twin," Venus is similar in size but vastly different in atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. A runaway greenhouse effect has resulted in:
*   Surface temperatures reaching 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Surface pressure equivalent to being over 0.5 miles (1 kilometer) underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Clouds composed of sulfuric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   Atmospheric entry heating up to 11,000 degrees Celsius due to friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

The Soviets, in contrast to the Americans who focused on lunar landings, were determined to pierce the "Venusian veil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Early Missions and Learning from Failures

The Venera project, named after the Russian word for Venus, aimed to land a probe on the Venusian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Driven by the [[political_influences_on_the_soviet_space_program | Space Race]] and a desire to outperform American missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, the program faced significant initial setbacks, with 11 failures before Venera 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. After Venera 3 failed, the project was transferred to the Lavochkin aerospace company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Venera 4 (1967)

Venera 4, launched in autumn 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, successfully launched its lander after reaching Venus in October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The probe entered the atmosphere, enduring 11,000-degree temperatures and 450G forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. It began transmitting atmospheric data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. However, the pressure and temperature quickly rose far beyond expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. After 93 minutes, 27 kilometers above the surface, the probe was crushed at 22 atmospheres and 530 degrees Fahrenheit (277 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Venera 5 & 6 (1969)

Despite the data from Venera 4 and American probe Mariner 5 indicating Venus was far more hostile than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, Venera 5 and 6 had already been finalized for their 1969 launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Engineers could only make minor strengthenings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Venera 5 transmitted for 53 minutes before succumbing to 27 atmospheres and 600 degrees Fahrenheit (320 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Venera 6 lasted 51 minutes, reaching 37.8 kilometers into the atmosphere before being crushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. These missions provided crucial data that informed future [[engineering_breakthroughs_in_venera_landers | engineering breakthroughs in Venera landers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Engineering Breakthroughs and First Surface Landings

The lessons from early failures led to significant [[engineering_breakthroughs_in_venera_landers | engineering breakthroughs]] for later Venera missions, aiming for survival in 840 degrees Fahrenheit (450 degrees Celsius) and 100 atmospheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Venera 7 (1970)

For Venera 7, launched in 1970, engineers consulted submarine designers, sourced new materials, and built a stronger test chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The lander, shaped like an egg and made of smooth titanium, was lined with shock absorbers and insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. It pre-chilled to freezing temperatures before entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Venera 7 reached Venus in December 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. After 35 minutes of atmospheric descent, its parachute melted or tore, causing it to free-fall and hit the ground at 35 miles (60 kilometers) per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Though initially presumed crushed, Soviet radio astronomers later rediscovered an extremely weak signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Venera 7 had bounced, landed on its side, and transmitted data for 23 minutes in temperatures hot enough to melt zinc or lead before its shell cracked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This marked the first successful landing and transmission from the Venusian surface.

### Venera 8 (1972)

Venera 8, launched two years after Venera 7, featured a similar design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The data from both Venera 7 and 8 paved the way for the next generation of probes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### Venera 9 & 10 (1975) - First Photos

Launched in 1975, Venera 9 and 10 were five times heavier than their predecessors, weighing 5 tons (5,000 kilograms) at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. They featured an orbiter and a lander component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The lander was a hermetically sealed titanium sphere, 2.6 feet (80 centimeters) wide, with advanced insulation and cooling systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. A titanium aerobrake replaced the problematic two-stage parachute design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

Their primary goal was to send back the first photographic panorama of the Venusian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Both probes landed successfully in late October 1975, hitting the ground at about 15 miles (25 kilometers) per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

*   **Venera 9** landed on a slight slope, revealing sharp rocks, soil, and a distant horizon, marking the first ever picture from the Venusian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Venera 10** landed a few days later on a rolling plain with hardened pieces of magma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Both probes transmitted for 50-60 minutes until their orbiters moved out of range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. These were stunning successes and a triumphant public relations event for the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Venera 11 & 12 (1978)

Venera 11 and 12 conducted significant scientific research, but their cameras were disabled by a mysterious electrical anomaly, leading to their missions being largely forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### Venera 13 & 14 (1982) - Color Photos and Audio

Venera 13 and 14 refined the designs of Venera 9 and 10, improving cameras, scientific instruments, and adding new heat-resistant technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. These missions were rated to last at least 30 minutes, and were capable of taking color images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Many sensors and instruments were even mounted outside the pressure chamber, made of platinum and covered in acid-resistant enamel, demonstrating the engineers' advanced understanding of the Venusian environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

*   **Venera 13** landed first, capturing black and white and color photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. The images showed pebbled, loose soil amidst bedrock, resembling the bottom of the ocean, with an orange sky due to the atmosphere absorbing blue light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   **Venera 14** showed a more weathered plain with fine-grained rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Famously, its drill landed exactly on the lens cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

Both probes carried microphones, capturing sounds of the lens cap detaching, the drill, and a gentle wind with faint hints of distant rumblings, presumed to be Venus-quakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

## Legacy and Future

The last Venera landers were built in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Subsequent space programs shifted focus to the Moon and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, partly because humans are unlikely to ever set foot on Venus alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

Despite this, the [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera series]] stands as an amazing [[soviet_space_exploration_achievements_and_failures | Soviet space exploration achievement]] and represents the country's pinnacle of space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. Engineers understand what it takes to land on Venus, and the Soviets accomplished it with decades-old technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

While the economics of sending a lander that survives for less than a day are challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, leading to proposals for high-altitude explorations like balloons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, there are [[future_possibilities_for_venus_exploration | future possibilities for Venus exploration]]. Advances in extreme environment technologies might enable landers to survive for weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

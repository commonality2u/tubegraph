Wang Laboratories' story is intrinsically linked to its founder, An Wang, an extraordinary engineer and shrewd businessman who guided the company's rise before its eventual decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Wang, an immigrant from China, arrived in America with nothing and built a computing empire, becoming a billionaire before ultimately losing it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This article explores the company's remarkable ascent and its regrettable fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Formative Years of An Wang

An Wang was born in Shanghai in 1920 to an upper-middle-class family; his father was an educated teacher and practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. During this period, China was in an era of chaos, divided between Chiang Kai-shek's KMT party and Mao Zedong's Communist Party of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Wang's family frequently moved to avoid the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

An Wang began schooling in the third grade as there was no first or second grade at the time, making him two years younger than his classmates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Despite this, he excelled in math and science, though less so in other subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. He possessed an unusual but quiet confidence in his abilities that would define his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. At age nine, he chose to take the junior high exams himself, achieving first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

A few years later, he tested into Shanghai Provincial High School (now Shanghai High School) and left his family at 13 to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. In high school, Wang remained quiet and kept to himself, excelling in math and science but struggling with Chinese and English, never mastering the latter even in adulthood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. At 16, he won a scholarship to Chaotong University, then considered "China's MIT," after testing in the top 10 of his class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

In late 1936, with Japan's invasion of China, Wang's university and family fled to the French concession of Shanghai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Despite the deaths of his mother, father, and older sister during the conflict, Wang graduated first in his class in 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. After graduation, he joined the Chinese Central Radio Corporation to build radios for the Chinese Army, working in Guilin under the threat of Japanese bombings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. His president observed his quiet genius, predicting he would "do something one day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

In 1944, after the Japanese overran Guilin, Wang fled to Chongqing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. He won a spot on a Chinese government test to send talents to the United States for schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Entering the Computing World

Wang arrived in the United States in 1945 and entered Harvard to study Applied Physics, finding the work easy and earning a PhD in just 13 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. He married Lorraine Chu, a young woman from a prominent Shanghai family, and they had three children: Fred, Courtney, and Juliet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

After his PhD, Wang joined the Harvard Computation Lab, working on the Mark 1, one of the world's most powerful computers at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. He focused on storing and reading large amounts of information without clumsy mechanical steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Existing methods like magnetic tapes destroyed information upon reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Wang's breakthrough was realizing he could simply rewrite the information immediately after reading, without sacrificing speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This concept was integrated into magnetic core memory, the precursor to RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

In 1949, Wang applied for a patent for this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This angered his Harvard colleagues, who believed such knowledge should be public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Howard Aiken, his boss, accused Wang of "run[ning] away with Harvard stuff and claim[ing] it as his own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Founding Wang Laboratories

In 1950, Harvard began shifting away from commercially applicable fields like computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Dr. Wang disagreed and decided to start his own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Despite the prevailing racism against Chinese Americans, challenges with English, and a lack of money, Wang had unshakable confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. He named the company after himself, Wang Laboratories, and famously refused suggestions to change it to something "more American" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Wang quit Harvard in April 1951, giving up a comfortable $5,400 annual salary just as his wife gave birth to their first son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Founded on June 30, 1951, Wang Laboratories began with only $600 in savings and Dr. Wang as its sole asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. He started by producing and selling core memories for about $4 each, doing all the selling himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

In 1952, he approached IBM about licensing his pending core memory patent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Talks dragged for a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Initially, Wang supplemented his income by teaching at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. He gained a reputation for custom consulting, famously telling clients, "First you show me all the ways you know how to do it. After you have done that, I will show you how to do it better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

In 1953, Wang struck a deal with IBM for consulting revenue and a future option to buy his patent, which provided stability to hire employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Wang was not only a brilliant engineer but also a sharp, tough businessman, unafraid to confront IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. He was deeply consumed by his work, micromanaging and reviewing all company mail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. He also envisioned passing the company to his son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

In 1955, IBM paid Wang $400,000-$500,000 (roughly $4.4-$5.5 million today) for his patent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. However, Wang's patent covered only a small part of the final core memory product; IBM later paid Jay Wright Forrester $13 million for a more complete application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This experience left Wang feeling regretful and harboring ill will toward IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Rise to Prominence: Calculators and Word Processors

IBM's money allowed Wang to shift from consulting to product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
In the early 1960s, Wang partnered with Compugraphic, a Boston-based company, to design and produce the Linasec, a machine that justified text lines for publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The Linasec was a hit, with Wang Laboratories' revenue growing from $427,000 in 1962 to $1.4 million in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. When competitors emerged, Wang refused Compugraphic's request to lower prices, leading Compugraphic to produce the machine themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This experience taught Wang never to produce a product he didn't fully control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

Wang's first major, fully controlled hit came in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. As the calculator industry transitioned to solid-state electronics, Wang sought to create a calculator as powerful as a mainframe but much smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. He used natural logarithms, and with a colleague, developed patented transistor logic to derive logarithmic values using just six stored values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This led to the Logarithmic Calculating Instrument (LOCI), introduced in January 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. The LOCI was powerful, capable of advanced logarithms using fewer than 300 transistors, selling 10-20 units a month at $6,500 to science labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. However, its intimidating keyboard required knowledge of logarithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

Wang then developed the Wang 300 calculator, introduced in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. This easy-to-use calculator, costing $1,695, was an immediate hit, selling to scientists, researchers, stockbrokers, and insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. The Wang 300 became famous for revealing a calculating error in a bond trading table that had been in use for three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Wang established a direct sales team, and revenues nearly tripled from $2.5 million in 1965 to $6.9 million in 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. That year, Wang Laboratories went public in a highly publicized IPO, with Wang's personal stock holdings valued at $50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

Wang wanted the "next big thing" beyond calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. In 1968, the BASIC computer language convinced him that computers were the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. He acquired Phil Hankins Inc. to help develop two new computers: the Wang 700 and Wang 3300 Basic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. However, Hewlett-Packard announced their HP 9100 calculator (which was functionally a computer, but called a calculator to avoid competing with IBM's "computers") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Recognizing the threat to the Wang 300, Wang rushed out the 700 in mid-1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. The 700 became Wang's most important product, pushing revenues to $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

By 1971, Wang knew the calculator market was becoming difficult; the Wang 300's cost had fallen to $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. With Intel introducing its first microprocessor, analysts predicted calculators would be integrated onto single chips, pushing prices to $100 or even lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. In 1971, in a bold move, Wang decided to pull out of the calculator market, starting with the lower end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This seemed "crazy" as calculators made up 75% of the company's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Yet, Wang was confident computers were the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

Wang pursued a two-pronged computer strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. First, a general-purpose computer, the Wang 3300 Basic, reached the market in 1970 but was not successful, taking 40 minutes to program using paper tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:15:05]</a>. Second, a word processor to replace IBM's Magnetic Tape Selectric typewriter in corporate environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. IBM held 80% of this market but paid it little attention, making it an opportune target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. The first iteration, the Wang 1200 word processor, announced in November 1971, was a modified Wang 700 calculator connected to an IBM Selectric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Reliability issues from improper components led to slumping sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

Three key products brought Wang back from the brink:
1.  **Wang 2200 (1973):** A successor to the 3300 Basic calculator/computer, the 2200 used BASIC for easy programmability and stored programs on Intel's ROM chips, enabling instant wake capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Priced at $6,000-$8,000, it became a capable small business computer and sold extremely well for 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
2.  **Wang Word Processing System (WPS) (1976):** Learning from the 1200's shortcomings, Dr. Wang tasked Harold Koplow and David Morris in September 1975 to redesign the word processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. They developed a powerful, upgradable, and easy-to-use network of machines, each with its own Intel 8080 microprocessor, capable of independent work or sharing texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. They ditched the unreliable IBM Selectric for a CRT screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. The system also simplified tasks with built-in prompts and a menu system, eliminating the need for secretaries to learn complex codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. The WPS was an immediate hit, bringing the company back from the brink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Lines formed to see it at trade shows, and accounting firm Touch Ross signed a $142,000 deal before it was even finished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
3.  **Wang VS Minicomputer (1977):** This minicomputer was smaller and cheaper than IBM's mainframes but powerful enough for commercial applications like spreadsheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. It competed effectively against Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX line, almost matching mainframe power (modeled after an IBM 360, though Wang avoided calling it that) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

These three products, released in quick succession, generated billions for Wang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. By the late 1970s, Wang was the world's largest supplier of CRT-based word processing systems, yet remained largely unknown or perceived primarily as a calculator maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. In 1978, the company launched a massive three-month TV ad blitz, culminating in a $150,000 (or $5,000 per second) 30-second Super Bowl ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Despite being only the 32nd largest computer maker, Wang was the only company advertising on TV besides IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Their "David vs. Goliath" spot directly attacked IBM, grabbing widespread attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. Awareness of Wang jumped from 3% to 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

Wang's revenues doubled from 1978 to 1980, and again two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Sales reached $1 billion in 1982 and $2 billion in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. By 1983, 80% of the largest US firms bought Wang equipment, with nearly half of the company's revenues coming from Fortune 500 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

## The Decline and Fall

### Succession and Product Delays

As Dr. Wang turned 60 in 1980, he began to slow down, spending less time at the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. In 1982, he formally retired as CEO, remaining chairman, and John A. Cunningham, a 16-year sales employee, took over as president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. Cunningham was highly respected and had built a powerful, fast-growing sales force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

However, Dr. Wang, who was also chief of product development and intimately involved in crafting successful products (spending an estimated 65% of his time there), was incredibly technical and an extraordinary manager of R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. His plan was for his sons, Fred and later Courtney, to eventually take over Wang Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. Fred Wang, though smart and decent, lacked his father's touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. He had grown up with wealth and privilege, and his mother pressured him into academia, contrasting with his father's self-made journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. After graduating, he worked as a low-level programmer before moving into marketing, then shadowing his father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. In 1980, Dr. Wang placed Fred in charge of the critical R&D department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. Elevating Fred into the triumvirate with An Wang and Cunningham proved disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.

The company's [[challenges_and_decline_of_wang_laboratories | turning point]] began with product issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. In October 1983, Wang Labs announced 14 new products, including the Wang Professional Image Computer with real-time image processing, hoping to challenge IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. The market reacted positively, and the stock soared, peaking in 1984 at $42.50, making Dr. Wang's stake worth over $1.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. This marked the peak of Wang's fortunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.

However, all the October 1983 products were delivered very late, some years behind schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Fred had rushed the announcements to prove himself, but the delays severely hurt his credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

### Resistance to PC and Internal Strife

It was the wrong time for "vaporware" (announced products that don't materialize promptly), as competition was intensifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. Two years earlier, IBM had released the IBM PC, which quickly took the world by storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. These PCs, equipped with word processing and spreadsheet software, immediately began eroding Wang's specialized word processors and 2200 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. Wang's revenues continued to grow, but primarily from maintenance contracts for existing customers, not new product sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

An Wang resisted the PC, viewing it as another "calculator," a future dead-end commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. Fred eventually pushed the company to build its own PC, but without compatibility with the IBM PC's massive software ecosystem, it was "Dead on Arrival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

The company never recovered from the botched 1983 announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. Cunningham, the president, believed Fred couldn't manage the R&D division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. Fred tried, but lacked Dr. Wang's ability to handle powerful egos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>. In October 1984, Dr. Wang moved Fred to run manufacturing, replacing the experienced John Cropper, overruling Cunningham's objections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. The R&D department continued producing "duds," and debt accumulated as the company expanded recklessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. Wang turned down potential mergers with Exxon's computer subsidiary and ITT, which could have shored up debt, because they would have taken control away from the Wang family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. For a long time, Dr. Wang had foreseen the future, but now, past his prime, his loyalty to his family contributed to the company's downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

### Final Decline and Bankruptcy

In April 1985, Wang Labs announced a stunning 66% quarterly profit decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. In July 1985, Cunningham resigned and sold all his stock, marking "the beginning of the end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. Dr. Wang briefly took over again, but in 1987, he made Fred the company president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. The company experienced unsteady profits, laying off a thousand people over the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. The board of directors repeatedly asked to bring in a professional manager to work with Fred, but An Wang refused five times in 1987, famously stating, "He is my son and he can do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

Losses mounted throughout 1988, straining relations with banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. In July 1989, Wang posted a $424 million annual loss, suspended dividends, and laid off more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. The stock crashed from $43 to just $5 a share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

Also in 1989, Dr. Wang, a lifelong smoker, was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, a highly dangerous condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. In August 1989, after cancer surgery, An Wang had to fire his own son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. Richard Miller, a turnaround expert with no computer industry experience, was appointed president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. Miller oversaw a massive $200 million asset sale and laid off 2,000 more employees in an attempt to cut debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. Despite this, the company still reported a $715.9 million loss in 1990, a staggering figure given its $2.5 billion in revenues that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.

Looking back, pinning Wang Labs' troubles solely on Fred would be a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. Wang's failure traces back to An Wang missing the PC Revolution, the power of office software, and the company's inability to find its next hit product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. Few companies survived this generational transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>, but the turmoil overhanging the company's succession certainly exacerbated the problems.

In January 1990, Wang's cancer returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. Despite surgery and chemotherapy, he lost his ability to speak and finally ceded full control to Miller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. An Wang, who was not a present father in their youth, spent his last months with his children, writing "I love you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. He died alone on March 24, 1990, at 70, in Massachusetts General Hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. In their last conversation, Dr. Wang asked Miller to try and save Wang Labs, saying, "Whatever you do...try and preserve name. I want it remembered has company founded by immigrant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.

Despite asset sales and an alliance with IBM, Wang Laboratories filed for bankruptcy in 1992, two years after its founder's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. It was acquired in 1999 by the Dutch company Getronics and renamed Getronics North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

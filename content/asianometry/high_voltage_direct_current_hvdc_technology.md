Singapore relies on burning natural gas for 95% of its electricity, with limited alternatives due to its small island size, lacking space for sprawling solar or wind farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To address this, the Australia-ASEAN Power Link, also known as the "Sun Cable," proposes to pipe renewable solar energy from Australia to Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This ambitious project aims to transmit clean solar power over vast distances, primarily utilizing High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## The Sun Cable Project
The Sun Cable project envisions a ten-gigawatt capacity solar farm spanning 12,000 hectares in Australia's Northern Territory, with panels prefabricated and assembled on-site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Electricity generated would first travel 500 miles (800 kilometers) to Darwin, contributing to the city's renewable energy goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The remainder would be exported to Singapore via an intercontinental 2,300 mile (3,700 kilometers) HVDC underwater power line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. A proposed battery system near the solar farm would store excess power for overnight demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This farm and battery storage system is estimated to cost about $7 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. As of its planning stages, details are subject to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Power Transmission: AC vs. DC
Electric current exists in two forms: Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. AC periodically reverses direction, while DC flows in only one direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Most modern systems are AC, with power generated, transmitted, and consumed in AC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Historically, AC became standard due to its greater economy in power transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

For transmission, voltage is stepped up using transformers to reduce energy losses, then stepped down for consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. AC transformers perform these tasks more efficiently and affordably than equivalent DC equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Limitations of AC for Long Distances
High voltage AC systems lose significant efficiency over long distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. A major contributing factor is the "skin effect," where AC flows more densely at the cable's surface, increasing resistance and power loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. In contrast, DC flows evenly throughout the entire width of a cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## The Rise of HVDC
[[modern_advancements_in_undersea_cable_technology | High Voltage Direct Current systems]] were developed to overcome AC's shortcomings in long-distance transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. While experiments date back to the 1880s, the first modern HVDC subsea cable was implemented in 1954 in Sweden, linking the island of Gotland to the mainland over 90 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Since then, the technology has rapidly developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### How HVDC Works
The key difference in HVDC systems is the inclusion of converters and inverters to transform AC power to DC and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. While this equipment is expensive and complex, adding to initial costs, it provides substantially better economics for transmitting power across long distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

![[Cost vs. Distance Graph of HVDC and HVAC]]
HVDC terminal costs are substantially higher than AC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. However, the cost of the transmission line rises faster with AC than DC due to significantly faster rising energy losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. For example, a 1,200-mile (2,000 km) AC line can have twice the losses of a DC line, even carrying half the power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. While DC costs more for short distances, it becomes more economical at a "breakeven distance" of roughly 62 miles (100 kilometers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

The Sun Cable's 3,200-kilometer HVDC line is estimated to have about 10% electrical loss, assuming 3% loss per 1,000 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. An equivalent HVAC line would likely have over twice that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

> [!INFO] Applications
> Without HVDC, many renewable energy sources like offshore wind or hydro would not be economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The Three Gorges Dam uses three overhead HVDC lines to transport electricity 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) to Guangzhou and Changzhou <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. HVDC is also perfect for undersea infrastructure where intermediate substations are impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Over 6,000 miles (10,000 kilometers) of subsea HVDC lines exist globally, with 70% in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. An example in Australia is Basslink, connecting Tasmania to Victoria over 230 miles (370 kilometers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Challenges of Implementing the Sun Cable HVDC Line
Laying subsea cables involves two key rules: keeping the cable length as short as possible to minimize costs and maintenance, and avoiding big deep trenches and steep slopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Most existing subsea power cables are laid in relatively shallow depths (under 0.6 miles or 1 kilometer) on flat, sediment-rich seabeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

The Sun Cable route, however, presents significant challenges:
*   **Deep Water:** The proposed route from Darwin across the Timor Sea to Indonesia, then through the Java Sea to Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. While most of the route is shallow (less than 600 feet or 200 meters), a 700-mile (1,200 kilometer) section south of East Timor at the Timor Trough would be over a mile deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This has been done before, such as with the SA.PE.I cable from Sardinia to the Italian mainland, the world's deepest subsea power cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Cable Material:** The SA.PE.I cable used aluminum rather than copper for its deepwater sections, as aluminum is cheaper, more plentiful, and lighter, allowing more cable to be carried and laid from a vessel, saving on expensive deepwater ship operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Interference in Busy Waterways:** For shallow sections like the Java Sea and Singapore Strait, which are among the busiest waterways globally with existing pipelines, fishing trawlers, and communication cables, engineers will likely need to trench or bury the cable 2-5 feet (0.6-1.5 meters) deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This protects against damage from fishing nets, boat anchors, and other dropped objects, which can cause blackouts and trigger liability clauses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Capacity:** A significant hurdle is obtaining the HVDC cable itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The manufacturing world is niche, complex, and slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. The Sun Cable project proposes two cables of 3,200 kilometers each, exceeding the total annual output of all European HVDC cable manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This necessitates setting aside additional money and 3-5 years to build up capacity from multiple manufacturers globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Financing and Lessons Learned
The subsea cable portion of the Sun Cable project alone is projected to cost about $5.6 billion USD before insurance and administrative expenses, with $4.6 billion going towards the cable itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This is over six times the cost of Australia's Basslink HVDC cable, which cost $670 million USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Including the solar farm, the entire project is likely to exceed $10 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

Seed funding for the privately-owned Sun Cable corporation has come from Australian billionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. However, the project will likely require multi-decade service agreements between Sun Cable and the power purchasing entity to attract private investment, similar to Basslink's 25-year service agreement with Hydro Tasmania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Basslink Incident
> Less than ten years after its 2006 commissioning, Basslink suffered a brutal six-month outage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. An arbiter found Basslink at fault, fining them $30 million USD in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This financial strain led to a technical default, delaying the repair of another two-month outage in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. The Sun Cable project can learn valuable lessons from these incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## Broader Impact and Opportunity
The immense size and cost of the megaproject will likely lead to its breakdown into multiple chunks and milestones over many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Once fully deployed, the Sun Cable is projected to provide up to 20% of Singapore's energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

The opportunity extends beyond Singapore. Energy demand in Southeast Asian countries is estimated to expand by 65% from 2015 to 2040, mostly from fossil fuels unless clean energy alternatives are provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Indonesia, through whose waters the cable passes, might also sign on to receive electricity before Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Benefits for Australia
> For Australia, the Sun Cable explores a new and exciting energy export paradigm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. The country's Northern Territory, larger than Egypt but with less than 250,000 people, is one of the most solar-irradiated areas in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This project would help cement better relationships with Southeast Asian countries and reduce Australia's reliance on traditional carbon-intensive exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

The project is scheduled to come online in 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

In late August 2023, Huawei quietly launched its Mate 60 Pro phone, featuring the Kirin 9000s System-on-Chip (SOC), a 7-nanometer class chip, which is believed to be manufactured by SMIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This development has caused significant discussion within the global semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Huawei Mate 60 Pro and Kirin 9000s Chip

The Mate 60 Pro is a high-performing phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The Kirin 9000s SOC has a die size of 107 square millimeters, which is approximately 2% larger than Huawei's previous leading-edge chips, the Kirin 9000 and 9000E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The Kirin 9000 was briefly produced using TSMC's 5-nanometer process before American sanctions ended that collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

This new 7-nanometer class chip is estimated to be about 5-6 years behind the current leading edge, as TSMC has been shipping 3-nanometer class chips throughout 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It's important to note that labels like "7 nanometers" or "5 nanometers" are marketing names for classes of chips and do not reflect the transistors' actual sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Teardowns and speed tests suggest the Kirin 9000s supports 5G connectivity, although Huawei appears to be discreet about this functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The SOC's CPU core is a customization of [[the_significance_of_arm_and_riscv_in_chinas_semiconductor_industry | Arm IP]], while the GPU seems to be a new custom design by Huawei or HiSilicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Concerns about manufacturing yields for this chip have been addressed, with early yields likely to be higher than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Yields typically improve as a fab refines its processes, and increased sales of the Huawei Mate 60 Pro will accelerate this for SMIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The 7nm node that produced this chip is considered "really, really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Why the Advancements Weren't Surprising

The emergence of the Kirin 9000s was not entirely unexpected. Previous reports had indicated the likelihood of a HiSilicon (Huawei) chip utilizing SMIC's N+2 process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Nikkei Asia had also mentioned SMIC's collaboration with Huawei on a new 5G chip earlier in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

News of the SMIC N+2 process first surfaced in July 2022, when it was used for Bitcoin miners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Bitcoin miners are suitable for improving a node due to their repetitive structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Producing a complex chip like the Kirin 9000s SOC demonstrates the significant progress made by SMIC, particularly under Co-CEO Liang Mong-song, in roughly a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## [[future_prospects_for_chinese_semiconductor_manufacturing | Future Prospects for Chinese Semiconductor Manufacturing]]

Further advancements are anticipated in [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's semiconductor manufacturing efforts]]. Dr. Burn Lin, a former TSMC R&D director, stated in January 2022 that SMIC could fabricate 5-nanometer class chips using only multi-patterning with 193-nanometer immersion lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This technology, despite being decades old, remains crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

While the United States banned exports of EUV lithography, 193-nanometer immersion machines like the Twinscan NXT 2000i are still performing 70-80% of the lithography work for leading companies like Intel, TSMC, and Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The ban on 193i machines was delayed, with the Netherlands and Japan joining the US in export restrictions only in June 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This means SMIC still possesses many of these machines, enabling them to scale up 7-nanometer production and potentially move towards 5-nanometer nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.# Implications of Chinese Semiconductor Advancements

## [[future_prospects_for_chinese_semiconductor_manufacturing | Future Prospects for Chinese Semiconductor Manufacturing]]

Further advancements are anticipated in [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's semiconductor manufacturing efforts]]. Dr. Burn Lin, a legendary TSMC R&D director and colleague of Liang Mong-song, stated in January 2022 that SMIC could fabricate 5-nanometer class chips using only multi-patterning with 193-nanometer immersion lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This technology, despite being 1-2 decades old, remains crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

While the United States banned exports of EUV lithography, 193-nanometer immersion machines like the Twinscan NXT 2000i are still performing 70-80% of the lithography work for leading companies like Intel, TSMC, and Samsung in their latest nodes, potentially for the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The ban on 193i machines was delayed, with the Netherlands and Japan joining the US in export restrictions only in June 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This means SMIC still possesses many of these machines, enabling them to scale up 7-nanometer production and potentially move towards 5-nanometer nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. However, challenges remain regarding machine breakdowns, spare parts, maintenance, and potential expansion of sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. It is expected that a 5-nanometer class Huawei chip will emerge within 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Emergence of a China-Only Supply Line

The Mate 60 Pro signals the emergence of a complete, self-contained semiconductor ecosystem within [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's semiconductor manufacturing efforts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The phone showcases many domestic Chinese suppliers for components like the radio frequency front-end module and satellite communications modem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. With the exception of memory, which appears to be from SK Hynix, the entire phone is essentially a China-only ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

This established ecosystem could produce various domestic electronics, including smartphone SOCs, CPUs, edge AI NPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## [[impact_of_generational_shifts_in_the_semiconductor_industry | Impact of Generational Shifts in the Semiconductor Industry]]

While a phone chip on par with a five-year-old release might not seem revolutionary, it represents a significant shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This development is expected to have a major impact on Qualcomm, Apple, and MediaTek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Qualcomm's sales of tens of millions of chips for Huawei phones are likely to be replaced by the Kirin 9000s and similar domestic chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Every non-Chinese semiconductor maker and Apple stands to lose business due to this new domestic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

SMIC is likely to be busy fulfilling Huawei orders for the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Beyond phones, the next major focus is AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. It is anticipated that a Chinese 7-nanometer AI accelerator, designed by companies like Biren, Baidu, Alibaba Cloud, or Tencent, could emerge in 1-2 years, unless sanctions intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's Semiconductor Manufacturing Efforts]] and Strategic Next Steps

[[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's semiconductor manufacturing efforts]] and technology ecosystem are real and deserve praise, especially given the impact of sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. From a manufacturing perspective, the main goal should be wide distribution of the phone to achieve scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Millions of units need to be sold not only domestically but also to international markets like Europe, Australia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. While Huawei phones lack Google products, efforts are underway to help users install them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

Every export sale strengthens SMIC by increasing chip production, which in turn raises yields, improves profitability, and helps fund the move to 5-nanometer production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

SMIC should also focus on replicating and reviewing advanced packaging technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. For advanced AI, new packaging architectures like chiplets and 2.5D die-stacking are necessary to handle data bandwidth requirements, which are considered achievable for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

The Chinese government will also need to bolster its domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment ecosystem, aiming to replace foreign suppliers like ASML, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, Lam Research, and metrology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. This is critical as foreign equipment may contain "kill switches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## US Response and Implications for Global Semiconductor Leaders

Jordan Schneider, a US-China tech relations expert, outlines potential US responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security justified previous restrictions on advanced semiconductors (16/14nm or below) by linking them to military modernization, weapons of mass destruction, and human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. US intelligence suggests that [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's semiconductor manufacturing efforts]] to produce advanced logic chips have significant implications for the regional military balance of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Given SMIC and Huawei's progress, if the US government views a Chinese 7-nanometer node as a national security threat, they may intensify efforts to stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. SMIC still relies on foreign equipment, as domestic suppliers are years behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Currently, equipment companies like Applied Materials, Lam Research, Tokyo Electron, and KLA can sell most of their tools for deposition, etch, metrology, and epitaxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Many tools used for 7nm and even 5nm can also be plausibly used for 28nm processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. These tools are ostensibly sold for lagging-edge nodes but are likely being repurposed to make chips like the Kirin 9000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

To prevent [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's semiconductor manufacturing efforts]] from developing leading-edge capacity at scale, the US government, in cooperation with allies, should consider tighter export controls on tools currently being repurposed, such as Argon Fluoride Immersion lithography, mask, and CMP equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Additionally, a less liberal use of licenses for firms like SMIC, which are on the entity list, could be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | Comparison to Global Semiconductor Leaders]] and Historical Parallel

The Kirin 9000s marks a significant event in [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing]] and is a "visible mark on technology history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. This development echoes Samsung's rise in 1986 when it shocked Japanese competitors by closing the semiconductor gap from five years to one with its 1 megabit DRAM chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. By 1988, Samsung achieved parity with Japan with its 4 megabit chip, contributing to Japan's subsequent decline in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

The People's Republic of China is adopting a similar approach to semiconductor manufacturing, an approach that proved successful for South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

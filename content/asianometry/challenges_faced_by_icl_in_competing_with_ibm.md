[[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | International Computers Limited (ICL)]] was formed in 1968 through a British government-arranged "shotgun marriage" of three computer manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The vision was for [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] to be the United Kingdom's answer to [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]], a national champion in computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, the company struggled to compete against American and East Asian rivals and was eventually sold to Fujitsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Early Competition in Punch Card Technology

The origins of this competition date back to the punch card era. Herman Hollerith, an American, invented an electromechanical tabulating machine for punched cards in the 1880s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. He founded the Tabulating Machine Company (TMC) in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, which later became [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

In 1907, Hollerith's British friends, R.P. Porter and Sir Raleigh Philpotts, licensed his technology to found the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. BTM received an exclusive license for the British Empire (excluding Canada) in exchange for 25% of its revenue, a condition inherited by [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Despite having access to [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s superior products, R&D, and manufacturing, BTM's sales lagged significantly behind its American counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. While [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] held 90% market share in the U.S., the British Empire market was evenly split between BTM and its rival, Power Samas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] executive Thomas Watson attributed BTM's underperformance to "sales incompetence," while BTM blamed the onerous 25% royalty rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### The Breakup of the IBM-BTM Alliance

In 1949, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] and BTM mutually dissolved their sales agreement and entered into open competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This freed BTM from the 25% royalty, tripling its operating profit and allowing investment in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. However, BTM's decision to compete with a giant like [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]], which had 80 times its revenue that year, was seen as "a little delusional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The license, which lasted half a century, kept [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] out of British territories and provided BTM with access to [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s products, including computers, at cost plus 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Slow Adoption of Computer Technology

Despite the rise of electronics and stored program computers after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, BTM and other punch card practitioners were slow to adapt, viewing computers as expensive niche devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] pursued an "evolution not revolution" approach, integrating electronic aspects into existing product lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

It wasn't until the mid-1950s that [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] fully entered the computer market with the IBM 650 in 1955, the world's first mass-produced and profitable computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. This left a massive door open for a domestic British player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. BTM (later ICT), despite having potential and producing its own computer, the Hollerith Electronic Computer (HEC One) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, showed little interest in entering the computing space throughout the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. Ninety percent of their revenue still came from profitable punch card machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

## Mergers and Industry Consolidation

As the 1950s ended, BTM faced significant challenges from [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] in export markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. In 1959, BTM merged with its weakened competitor, Power Samas, to form International Computers and Tabulators Limited (ICT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This merger created a "massive headache" due to integrating mechanically-minded R&D departments, costing years of progress that could have been spent on electronic computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

### The Transistor Revolution and Software Crisis

In 1956, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] introduced the IBM 1401, a transistor-based computer that was cheaper, faster, and more reliable, obsoleting all vacuum tube computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. The 1401, with its ecosystem of hardware, peripherals, and software, directly targeted the core use case of the punch card industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. It sold over 10,000 installations, becoming [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s most important product by 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

This led to a "software crisis" where software costs began to surpass hardware costs due to the need to write new software for every hardware upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] responded by investing $500 million to develop the System/360, a range of computers with a single scalable architecture, allowing customers to upgrade hardware without rewriting software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. This third-generation computer system caught the entire industry by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

ICT had planned a family of computers for 1968 but was forced to rework and quickly release its 1900 series, based on the Canadian-made Ferranti Packard 6000, to take advantage of [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] production delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. English Electric, another British player, licensed RCA's IBM System/360-compatible architecture for its System 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

## Government Intervention and Political Pressure

By 1964, the British computing industry primarily consisted of English Electric and ICT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. The Harold Wilson government established the Ministry of Technology (Mintec) in 1964, with a top focus on the British computer industry, fearing its rapid demise against American giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. Concerns also mounted about America's widening technology gap, exemplified by General Electric's acquisition of France's Bull and the USA denying export licenses for computers to France to prevent H-bomb perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

Mintec sought to consolidate the industry by merging English Electric and ICT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. After initial resistance, the re-elected Wilson government offered £30 million as an incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. Despite a reduced dowry due to the UK economy's worsening in 1968, the merger finalized in July 1968, creating [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] became the world's largest non-American computer manufacturer, with £100 million in annual revenue and 34,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

However, [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] inherited two incompatible mainframe product families: the 1900 series from ICT and the System 4 from English Electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. Political pressure from the Labour government prevented [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] from phasing out the technically outdated 1900 series because it was British-made, unlike the System 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. This political interference kept [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] focused on mainframe manufacturing, causing it to miss the minicomputer boom of the 1990s, which eventually challenged [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

### Financial Strain and R&D Challenges

The computer industry's first recession in 1968 saw General Electric and RCA exit the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] sought government aid, but the new conservative government under Edward Heath in 1970 was initially anti-interventionist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. Though [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] eventually received a £40 million government loan in 1971, it became clear the company could not afford the heavy R&D costs of staying competitive in the British mainframe computing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>.

[[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] faced two particularly heavy costs:
*   **Software Development:** Over a third of [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]]'s R&D budget was dedicated to writing new operating systems for every new architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
*   **[[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | Semiconductor Production Cycles]]:** The accelerating pace of [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor manufacturing technology]] meant that product cycles tightened significantly, making it impossible for [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.

## Collaboration with Fujitsu and Demise

[[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s response to [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | Fujitsu]]'s challenge in the 1980s, the IBM-4300 series, offered a fourfold improvement in cost performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>. [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]], whose technology was only three years behind [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] at one point, was caught in this crossfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. Estimated R&D spend needed to nearly triple to maintain competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

Facing another economic recession in 1980 and projected losses, [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] sought more government help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. The Thatcher government, though initially reluctant, agreed to a £200 million loan guarantee, but demanded a replacement of the management team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.

To manage skyrocketing R&D costs, particularly the [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor]] burden, [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] sought partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. American companies could only offer 3,000 logic gates on a chip, compared to [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]]'s 1,000, but [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | Fujitsu]] offered 5,000 gates and a five-year roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>. This led to a technology transfer deal in 1981, giving [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] access to [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | Fujitsu]]'s advanced [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor technology]] (8,000 gates) in exchange for [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]]'s peripheral technologies and sales of [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | Fujitsu]]'s [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]-compatible mainframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

By 1984, [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] was taken over by British telecommunications firm Standard Telephone and Cables (STC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. The 1981 rescue and [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | Fujitsu]] partnership effectively ended [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]]'s hopes of being a national champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. The company slashed R&D, focused on sales and systems integration, and became an assembler and distributor of other companies' components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>.

In 1990, [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | Fujitsu]] acquired [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>, and by 2000, the brand was shut down for good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

## Conclusion

The downfall of [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] highlights several trends:
*   **Lack of Technical Primacy:** [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] consistently followed [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] and Japanese giants, failing to achieve business leadership in its domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.
*   **Splintering Industry:** The computer industry did not become vertically integrated like telecom. Instead, it splintered, with specialized companies emerging in areas like software, raising the stakes beyond what large combines like [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] could sustain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>.
*   **Hollowness of National Prestige:** [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | ICL]] and its political sponsors aimed to beat [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] in its strongest area – mainframe computers – but could not muster the necessary resources and ultimately faced the same market circumstances that led to [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s decline in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

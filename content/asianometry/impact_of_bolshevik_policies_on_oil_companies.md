At the start of the 1960s, the Soviet Union was the world's second-largest oil producer, nearly matching the entire Middle East's oil production. Many European countries became dependent on Soviet oil, which the Communist Party leveraged to its advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Russian Empire's Oil Industry: A Precursor

The Russian Empire annexed Baku in the late 1820s, which later became one of the world's leading oil production sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. By the 1880s, Baku's oil production reached a third of America's, and by 1914, 90% of Russia's oil came from Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Although the Tsar owned the oil fields and generated a quarter of government revenues from oil taxes, over 20 private companies, including the significant Nobel Brothers, managed the fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The Nobel Brothers, particularly Ludwig Nobel, were pioneers, introducing oil pipelines and tankers, which formed the basis of Russia's modern oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This thriving private industry was partly due to a corporate-friendly shift in Tsarist policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. However, by 1904, the Baku oil industry began to stagnate, with overall production declining from 11.5 million metric tons in 1901 to 9.4 million in 1916 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Bolshevik Takeover and Nationalization

The arrival of the Bolsheviks marked a dramatic shift. In 1919, British oil companies like Shell and other major British firms attempted to annex Russia's oil regions as the Empire collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. However, the British government refused military intervention, leading to massive financial losses for Western oil companies when the Soviets took over and [[nationalization_of_banks_and_industries_in_early_soviet_russia | nationalized]] all their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Shell, for example, lost about 171.4 million rubles of British capital, and French and German investors also lost millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Shell, initially expecting the Soviet state's imminent collapse, struggled to adapt to this new reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Recapturing Baku During the Civil War

During the [[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_soviet_economy | Russian Civil War]], the non-Russian ethnic groups in Baku tried to establish the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. However, Lenin and the Bolsheviks desperately needed Baku's oil to power their armies and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. In December 1920, the Red Army reconquered the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. They found a "wasteland" where oil production was only a third of pre-war levels due to natural decline and the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### New Economic Policy (NEP) and Concessions Debate

In 1921, with the [[economic_impact_of_oil_production_on_the_soviet_economy | Soviet economy in shambles]], Lenin initiated the New Economic Policy (NEP), which reversed some central planning policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. A controversial aspect of NEP was the potential resumption of concessions to foreign capitalists for natural resource exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This sparked debate within the Politburo:
*   **Alexei Rykov**, Chairman of the Supreme Council of the National Economy, argued foreign help was unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Mikhail Tomsky**, a union trade leader, feared foreign capitalists would turn Soviet workers against their country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Joseph Stalin**, then Commissar of Nationalities, doubted workers would support the policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

Despite these objections, Lenin, exhibiting a pragmatic streak, advocated for the policy, winning the vote 8 to 6 in February 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. He argued that "without concessions we cannot hope to receive the benefits of advanced modern capitalist technology" necessary for building large-scale industry, particularly in petroleum extraction, which was "of such extraordinary importance for the entire world economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Lenin even asked members not to keep written records of these discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

Reports from Baku detailed broken transportation, supply shortages, and saltwater intrusion into oil fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Workers struck in April 1921 to protest conditions, leading to recommendations for the Soviets to engage global oil syndicates immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Failed Foreign Concessions

Oil was a critical early opportunity for engagement between the Soviets and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. After nationalization, Nobel Brothers shrewdly sold half their Russian oil assets to Standard Oil of New Jersey (forerunner of ExxonMobil) for $7-9 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Standard Oil made a calculated bet on the Soviet Union's collapse, hoping Nobel would reclaim assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Standard Oil, Shell, and Anglo-Persian Oil Company entered negotiations for vast concessions in Baku and Grozny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

A deal for Standard and Anglo-Persian to control half of Grozny and build a Black Sea pipeline almost materialized but fell apart when Standard passed under pressure from the Warren G. Harding Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. In the end, the vast foreign concessions Lenin pushed for never materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. For example, Sinclair Oil Corporation offered a $250 million loan in 1923 for a near-complete 25-year monopoly on Grozny's richest oil areas; the Soviets declined but granted Sinclair a concession on Sakhalin Island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. However, Japan prevented Sinclair from drilling, and the Teapot Dome scandal consumed the company, leading to their pullout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Another small American company, International Barnsdall Corporation, was given permission to scope out undeveloped lands but pulled out in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

The U.S. government viewed the Soviet regime as illegitimate, discouraging trade because the Soviets had repudiated Russian Empire debt, [[nationalization_of_banks_and_industries_in_early_soviet_russia | nationalized]] American private property, and advocated for the overthrow of the American government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This, combined with Lenin's illnesses, closed the window for bringing foreign capitalism back into the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Engagement with British Companies (Vickers)

Despite the lack of major foreign concessions, the Soviets began drilling on their own, with production surging from 4.2 million metric tons in 1921 to 6.3 million in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This was possible due to British equipment. Vickers, a British weapons and engineering firm, had also suffered significant losses during Soviet nationalization (over two million pounds in assets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Unlike Shell, Vickers opted to engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

In 1922, the Soviets announced the national electrification plan (GOELRO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Vickers reached out, selling turbines to the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. In 1924, they demonstrated modern oil drilling equipment to a Soviet delegation, impressing them enough to deploy it in Baku and Grozny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The Soviets paid Vickers a percentage of their foreign oil sales, as oil became one of the country's few profitable export sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Vickers delivered millions of pounds worth of oil equipment, and the Soviets paid a handsome sum, single-handedly keeping Vickers' struggling oil equipment business afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Domestic Oil Policy and World War II

For a long time, the Soviets largely disregarded using oil for domestic purposes, focusing on hydropower, electrification, and coal, despite growing energy consumption (over 13% annually in the 1920s and 30s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This was due to a belief in finite oil reserves, seeing oil as too expensive and rare compared to coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Despite geologists like Ivan Gubkin insisting on large oil deposits in the Volga-Ural basin, the Soviets declined to heavily invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

The Nazi German invasion (Operation Barbarossa) in June 1941 changed this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Germany needed gasoline, which they lacked reliable supplies of, and aimed to capture the oil-rich cities of the Caucasus, including Baku and Grozny, as part of "Case Blue" in 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

[[soviet_oil_strategy_during_world_war_ii | Soviet oil strategy during World War II]] led to a hurried evacuation of personnel and machinery from Baku, moving drilling equipment, pipelines, and entire refineries to the Volga-Ural area, which became known as the "Second Baku" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. This devastated oil production in the Caucasus, dropping by over 50% in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Azerbaijani historians note that production rates didn't return to 1941 levels until after the Soviet Union dissolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The Soviets, aided by Americans disassembling and sending six refineries, scrambled to ramp up production in the Volga-Ural fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Stalin himself called petroleum "the soul of military equipment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. However, [[influence_of_military_and_heavy_industry_on_soviet_economic_policy | wartime production]] in the Volga-Urals never fully replaced the lost output from Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

## Post-War Development and International Influence

The war taught the Soviets the crucial importance of oil. After WWII, they sought to control as much oil as possible, reflected in their occupation of Romania and temporary control of Austria's oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. They also confiscated oil technologies as war booty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

Throughout the 1950s, the Soviets invested heavily in developing the Volga-Ural Basin, shifting priority away from Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. This strategy paid off; by the end of the 1950s, fields like Romashkino, six times the size of Singapore, produced more oil than all other regions combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The Volga-Ural Basin remains a significant oil production area today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

[[economic_impact_of_oil_production_on_the_soviet_economy | Oil and gas helped Lenin industrialize the country]] and fueled the Red Army's victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. As production expanded, the Soviets began exporting energy, initially to earn foreign currency for goods and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. Over time, these energy exports, and the [[influence_of_soviet_oil_exports_on_international_relations | influence of Soviet oil exports on international relations]], became a political tool to maintain leverage over satellite states and allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. At the start of the [[soviet_oil_production_in_the_1960s | 1960s]], the Soviet Union was the world's second-largest oil producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

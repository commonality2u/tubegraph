## Introduction
While much attention is given to advanced, cutting-edge chip technologies, the current global chip shortage is most acutely felt in the realm of [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | trailing edge semiconductors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. These less "sexy" but essential components, like the ATSAMD21 microcontroller from Microchip Technology, are facing significant supply constraints, with many out of stock for a year or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This article explores what defines trailing edge semiconductors, the reasons behind their scarcity, and the ongoing efforts to address the issue.

## What Are Trailing Edge Semiconductors?
Most chips are not the "sexy three-nanometer monsters" but rather unheralded workhorses built with what are called trailing edge process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

*   **Definition**: The definition of a trailing node can vary, but TSMC classifies anything at 16 nanometers or older as trailing edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. These nodes accounted for approximately 50% of 2021 revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   **Subdivisions**: They can be further subdivided into:
    *   **Mature Nodes**: Generally considered to be in the 40 to 450 nanometer range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
    *   **Legacy Nodes**: Anything older than the mature nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Microcontrollers**: Most microcontrollers are made with 110 or 180 nanometer processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

## The Lifespan of a Fab
There are roughly 200 fabs operating globally, most built before 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **Initial Phase**: When new, these factories produce leading or near leading edge chips, which sell with high margins and help recoup the initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Commoditization**: The industry moves quickly, with new leading edge chips emerging within a year or two. This causes prices for older products to collapse as they become commoditized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
*   **Continued Operation**: Once a fab is built, its operational costs are relatively low. It can continue to operate as long as the market price is slightly higher than its variable costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

## Causes of the Trailing Edge Shortage
Fab capacity at trailing edge nodes was already tight for several years before the COVID-19 pandemic due to various industry factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Pandemic Impact**:
    *   **Initial Downturn**: Early 2020 saw economic activity plummet, leading automotive companies and other manufacturers to halt production and cancel orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. STMicroelectronics, for example, cut production by 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
    *   **Unexpected Rebound**: A massive, unexpected economic bounce-back occurred the same summer, causing companies to rush to get products out, resulting in shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
    *   **Inventory Hoarding**: Companies first depleted existing inventories, then began purchasing more than needed to replenish stock and secure future output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Demand**: The broader semiconductor industry is experiencing unprecedented demand for chips driven by the cloud, the 5G transition, and global conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   **Utilization Limits**: Since 2019, fab utilization rates have soared to the mid-90s, far exceeding their long-term target of 80%, indicating that foundries are at their production limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

## [[challenges_in_expanding_trailing_edge_capacity | Challenges in Expanding Trailing Edge Capacity]]
Microchip executive chairman Steve Sanghi estimates that $150 billion in additional investment is needed over the next five years to meet trailing edge demand growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. However, expanding trailing edge capacity is very slow, growing at about 2% annually compared to over 25% for the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   **Investment Hesitancy**: Trailing edge chip makers have been reluctant to invest because:
    *   Customers expect low prices set by foundries with fully depreciated fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
    *   Wafers for these nodes are cheap, accounting for only 10% of total sales revenues despite contributing significant microprocessor volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
    *   Building a new fab (hundreds of millions to billions of dollars) would likely lead to a period of substantial underutilization and financial underperformance, making companies prefer to stick with existing backlogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.
*   **Equipment Limitations**: Many foundries use older, niche equipment, such as those making 200-millimeter wafers (smaller than the current 300-millimeter standard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. New 200-millimeter equipment is not readily available, with companies preferring refurbished gear, leading to supply shortages as these fabs run at high capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

## Reasons for Sticking with Trailing Edge Nodes
Historically, companies like AMD and Apple always pursued the fastest, "sexiest" leading edge nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. However, the trend of upscaling designs has slowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.
*   **Scaling Challenges**: It is now harder to move to the next node, as customers must balance benefits against costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. Some chip types, such as analog, mixed-signal, radio frequency chips, and MEMS (like accelerometers), do not scale well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. Demand for these chips is very high, particularly with the Ukrainian war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
*   **The 28-22 Nanometer Generation Gap**: The 28 nanometer node is often considered the most advanced still using a planar gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. Newer nodes require dealing with more complex FinFET gates, rampant multi-patterning, and possibly extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. These factors contribute to increased complexity, less reliable products, lower yields, and higher costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
    *   As a result, 28 nanometers represents the "bottom of the cost curve" on a per-100-million gate basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
    *   Many customers do not require significantly faster chips, especially when considering these trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.
*   **Automotive Industry Demand**: Automotive companies prioritize reliability and effectiveness in challenging conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. They are among the largest consumers of trailing edge chips, accounting for 40% of market demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.

## Industry Response and Solutions
The industry is beginning to recognize that backlogs in older nodes are stretching 18 months or longer and must take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.
*   **Building New Fabs**: Companies are starting to invest in new fabs for trailing edge nodes:
    *   **TSMC**: While building an N5 plant in the U.S., TSMC is also constructing two new trailing edge fabs in Japan and Kaohsiung, operating in the 28-22 nanometer range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. They have announced price increases on older nodes to fund these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.
    *   **Samsung**: Samsung, traditionally focused on leading edge technology, announced increased investment in trailing edge semiconductor capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.
    *   **China**: Up to a dozen new fabs are under construction across mainland China. SMIC, a leading Chinese foundry, is spending over $9 billion to add trailing edge wafer capacity in Shanghai and Shenzhen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. [[implications_of_chinese_semiconductor_advancements | These Chinese advancements]] are significant.
    *   **India**: The conglomerate Vedanta signed a memorandum of understanding with Foxconn to build a trailing edge fab in the 65-28 nanometer range with substantial government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.
    *   **U.S. Chips Act**: This American bill authorizes incentives for semiconductor industry construction and modernization, appropriating $2 billion specifically for "mature technology nodes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.
*   **Improving Existing Fabs**: Even if new 90-nanometer fabs are not being built in the West, existing fabs can be improved:
    *   **Wafer Upgrades**: Moving from 200-millimeter wafers to 300-millimeter wafers can yield over two times as many dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>. This requires significant changes to floor layout and automation systems but doubles output without building an entirely new fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.
*   **Design Side Improvements**: [[emerging_trends_and_challenges_in_chip_design | Advancements on the design side]] include:
    *   **Open-Source EDA Software and PDKs**: These initiatives aim to make hardware development cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Tools for Die Shrinks**: New tools can make it easier for designers to adapt designs for or execute a die shrink onto another node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. An example is the open-source 130-nanometer PDK released by Google and SkyWater Technologies, which could lead to long-delayed die shrinks and provide consumers with faster, better chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.

## Outlook
These efforts will take time, with supply constraints for trailing edge chips expected to continue until at least 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. However, some positive signs are emerging: suppliers are reporting slowing growth in revenues for trailing edge nodes, major players like TSMC and Samsung, along with China and India, are racing to build new fabs, and a potential slowing in the macroeconomy could dampen overall demand, possibly aligning with the new supply capacity entering the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.

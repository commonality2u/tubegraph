Sri Lanka's economic development has been a subject of extensive study for decades, with recent events adding a challenging new chapter to its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Post-Independence Strengths and Early Challenges (1948-1956)

Upon gaining independence from the British in 1948, after over 150 years as a colony, Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) possessed several advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>:
*   **Strategic Location**: The island held a key trading port location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure**: It suffered no infrastructure damage from World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Social Indicators**: The country ranked highly in education and population health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Political Governance**: Sri Lanka was a democracy with universal suffrage, seen by others as a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Export Economy**: It inherited a highly productive export economy, specializing in tea, rubber, and coconuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

In 1950, Sri Lanka's GNP (adjusted for purchasing power parity) surpassed that of India, Pakistan, Thailand, and even [[evolution_of_south_koreas_political_and_economic_landscape | South Korea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. By 1960, its per capita gross income was $141, significantly higher than Thailand's $96 and Indonesia's $50, and comparable to [[evolution_of_south_koreas_political_and_economic_landscape | South Korea]]'s $156 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

An advisor in the late 1950s noted that the main challenge would be to maintain high living standards with a growing population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The development plan aimed to expand agricultural exports, largely through infrastructure projects in less populated dry zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

However, this promising start concealed underlying issues, including ethnic tensions and fateful policy choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The 1948 constitution, drafted mainly by Sinhalese elites and colonial administrators, failed to address minority concerns, particularly those of the Tamils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

The first general election brought the conservative United National Party (UNP) to power, who, to counter rising leftist popularity, implemented expensive food subsidies and disenfranchised Indian Tamils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. These subsidies were initially funded by booming commodity prices from World War II and the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. However, when the Korean War ended in 1953, commodity export revenues crashed, forcing the government to raise prices on rice and public services. This led to widespread protests known as the "hartal," causing the Prime Minister to resign and the UNP to lose the 1956 election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Shift to State Control and Import Substitution (1956-1977)

The new government elected in 1956 marked a decline in relations between the Sinhalese and Tamil communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. [[Impact of ethnic tensions on Sri Lankas economy | Ethnic harmony]] was deprioritized, and Sinhala was established as the country's sole official language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

Economically, the government imposed import restrictions on consumer goods to conserve foreign currency and established state monopolies to fulfill domestic demand, implementing what is known as [[policies_causing_economic_inefficiencies_in_sri_lanka | import substitution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. While [[evolution_of_south_koreas_political_and_economic_landscape | East Asian giants]] like Taiwan and [[evolution_of_south_koreas_political_and_economic_landscape | South Korea]] successfully used [[policies_causing_economic_inefficiencies_in_sri_lanka | import substitution]] for industrialization (e.g., in heavy and specialty chemical industries in the 1970s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, its success depends on context and a broader economic strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Earlier [[policies_causing_economic_inefficiencies_in_sri_lanka | import substitution]] attempts in Taiwan and [[evolution_of_south_koreas_political_and_economic_landscape | South Korea]] in the 1950s (textiles, fertilizers) failed to achieve growth targets and led to corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

In Sri Lanka, wide-ranging [[policies_causing_economic_inefficiencies_in_sri_lanka | import substitution]] policies resulted in inefficiencies, as the government attempted to produce everything domestically, leading to higher product costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Import demand shifted from finished goods to raw materials, making the economy vulnerable to price shocks in raw goods, such as the 1970s oil crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

By the 1970s, Sri Lanka had transformed from a relatively open, market-based economy into one of the most closed non-communist economies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Economic growth drastically slowed, and its development lagged behind its peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Per capita income in 1977 was only $200, a mere $60 increase from 1960. In comparison, [[evolution_of_south_koreas_political_and_economic_landscape | South Korea]]'s per capita income was $820, Malaysia's $930, Thailand's $420, and Indonesia's $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

The country's once-thriving plantation economy fell into disarray due to threats of nationalization since 1958, leading foreign companies to cease investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. After actual nationalization in the 1970s, the sector continued to decline under six ministries with overlapping powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. The government became the employer of last resort, doubling its GDP share from 1961 and providing over 50% of manufacturing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Policies in higher education, exams, and public sector employment favored Sinhalese elites, fostering radical ideologies among minority Tamil youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Economic Liberalization and Civil War (1977-2009)

The severe economic stagnation eventually built political will for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. In 1977, a new government attempted reforms and economic opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The regime sought to attract foreign investors and establish a labor-intensive export development economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Key measures included:
*   Establishing free trade zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   Guarantees against nationalization without compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   Devaluing the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   Limiting state participation in the wider economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   Reducing the politically sensitive rice subsidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

This period was a prime opportunity, as Sri Lanka was opening up before China and many other Asian nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. The international community lauded the shift, providing unprecedented foreign aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Growth surged from 2.9% annually before 1977 to 6% during 1977-1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Garment exports increased from 2% to 16% of total exports, and tourist numbers more than doubled from 1.9 million (1978) to 4 million (1982), nearly tripling foreign exchange earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

However, the 1977 election also brought Tamils to power on a platform for an independent Tamil state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The government failed to manage the initial negative impacts of liberalization, which hit the poorest hardest through inflation, removal of food subsidies, and lifted trade protections on farmed goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Money from subsidies and foreign aid was wasted on loss-making state-owned "zombie" companies and questionable mega-infrastructure projects, like a new capital and housing program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

These worsening conditions, coupled with the government's authoritarian tactics against Tamil protests, ignited a cycle of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. The Tamil militant wings consolidated into the LTTE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. In July 1983, an LTTE attack led to "Black July," a brutal anti-Tamil pogrom, plunging the country into chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The LTTE, supported by the Tamil diaspora, established a de facto state in the north and east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The brutal civil war, despite several pauses, lasted until 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

Despite the civil war, the government continued its opening-up policies, aiming to build a labor-intensive export industry, following the playbook of other Asian economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Loss-making State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) like textile mills were privatized or closed, and free trade privileges were expanded beyond free trade zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This reform drive persisted even after the center-left People's Alliance (PA) took power from the UNP in 1994, moderating their populist platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

Manufacturing gained prominence, ending the country's historical reliance on agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Garments, rubber-based products, and gems became top manufactured exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Sri Lanka's textile and garment industry, globally competitive, attracted major customers like Abercrombie & Fitch and Victoria's Secret, and began evolving into its own multinationals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

Despite the civil war, the economy grew at about 5% annually, and poverty declined from 29% (1995) to 15% (2006) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. However, the war caused notable economic losses, such as Motorola and Harris Corporation departing to Malaysia in the early 1980s instead of building assembly plants in Sri Lanka due to political instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

## Post-Civil War Boom and Unsustainable Growth (2009-2019)

In 2007, a new administration led by Mahinda Rajapaksa came to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. His government, with support from various countries, notably China, launched a military campaign that finally defeated the LTTE in 2009, bringing peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This victory allowed Rajapaksa to consolidate power, calling snap elections and amending the constitution to expand his executive powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

Facing high energy prices and the global financial crisis, the government emphasized its role in "guiding the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. In 2012, it reimposed export tariffs on tea and rubber to encourage domestic processing, signaling a reversal from 30 years of trade liberalization towards [[policies_causing_economic_inefficiencies_in_sri_lanka | import substitution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

Despite this shift away from liberalization, the five years following the civil war saw strong economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>:
*   GDP grew 7% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   The stock market boomed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   Per capita income rose from about $1,000 (2004) to $3,200 (2013) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
*   Inflation fell from 22% (2008) to 3.17% (2014) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   Unemployment halved from 8% (2004) to 4% (2013) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
*   Poverty rates declined from 15% to 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

By 2019, Sri Lanka had become an upper middle-income country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

### Underlying Issues of the Boom

Beneath these positive statistics, signs emerged that the growth was not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>:
*   **Unsustainable Growth Drivers**: 70% of real GDP increase from 2004-2013 came from [[sri_lankas_shift_from_manufacturing_to_debt_funded_infrastructure | debt-fueled public sector construction and infrastructure]], not labor-intensive manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **Fiscal Deficits and Debt**: Sri Lanka consistently ran fiscal deficits and breached IMF agreements, with annual debt-to-GDP ratios steadily increasing since 2012, hitting nearly 87% in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. This was further fueled by a massive tax cut under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **Mega-Projects**: Projects like the $15 billion Colombo Port City, a reclaimed land city, while part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, had questionable economic viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. Its location in the south, far from war-torn northern and eastern provinces, and its proximity to the government's political power base, raised concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. These projects also showed signs of corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
*   **Debt Composition**: Only about 10% of Sri Lanka's total debt was owed to China; the vast majority was owed to international bond markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
*   **Decline of Traditional Drivers**: [[sri_lankas_shift_from_manufacturing_to_debt_funded_infrastructure | Manufacturing's share of GDP]] peaked near 20% in the early 2000s but declined to 15% thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Growth in manufacturing focused on the domestic sector (food, beverage, tobacco) rather than export-oriented industries like garments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Vietnam, embarking on manufacturing later, surpassed Sri Lanka in developing country manufacturing market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
*   **Dependence on Remittances**: Domestic dissatisfaction led many Sri Lankans to seek work abroad, with nearly 2 million estimated migrant workers and 100,000-200,000 more leaving annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. Remittances became a major economic driver, representing 68% of the economy, and the second-biggest foreign income earner after exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. In 2019, $6.7 billion in remittances covered over 85% of the country's forex shortfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

## Recent Economic Crisis (2020-Present)

The [[sri_lankas_shift_from_manufacturing_to_debt_funded_infrastructure | shift from manufacturing to debt-funded infrastructure]], supported by remittances, reduced Sri Lanka's resilience to external shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. The [[effect_of_the_pandemic_on_sri_lankas_economic_crisis | COVID-19 pandemic]], arriving in 2020, severely impacted the country's economic drivers, particularly those generating foreign exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>:
*   **Exports**: Garment, tea, and rubber exports to locked-down countries in Asia, Europe, and the US rapidly declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Total exports in 2020 were $11 billion, far below the expected $18.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   **Remittances**: Foreign remittances drastically declined due to pandemic lockdowns affecting workers abroad in countries like [[evolution_of_south_koreas_political_and_economic_landscape | South Korea]] and Qatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. Reduced international travel also hindered workers' ability to go abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
*   **Tourism**: Tourism, Sri Lanka's third-largest foreign exchange earner after exports and remittances, was hit hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. After experiencing double-digit growth with booming Chinese tourism post-civil war, a series of suicide bombings in 2019 followed by the pandemic caused tourism to plummet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. Tourist numbers dropped from 2.5 million (2018) generating $5.6 billion, to just half a million (2020) with an 80% decline in earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

With its major foreign currency generators crippled, the government turned to [[policies_causing_economic_inefficiencies_in_sri_lanka | import substitution]] for items like fertilizer to preserve dwindling foreign reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. This, in turn, led to domestic shortages, power cuts, rationing, and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. The Sri Lankan Rupee has seen a substantial drop in value against the US dollar since March 2022, exacerbated by extensive money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.

The [[effect_of_the_pandemic_on_sri_lankas_economic_crisis | economic hardship]] was a long time coming, with the pandemic contributing the final push to a country already on the brink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. The situation has been compared to the ongoing financial crisis in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. The path out requires coherent political leadership, debt restructuring, economic reform, and improved relations with the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

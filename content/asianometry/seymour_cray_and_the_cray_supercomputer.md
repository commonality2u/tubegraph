Computer designer Seymour Cray, while at Control Data Corporation, was once asked his five and one-year goals. He famously stated:
> Five-year goal: Build the biggest computer in the world.
> One-year goal: One-fifth of the above. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>

This reflects Seymour Cray's singular focus on pushing the limits of computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. His lifelong quest involved making the biggest supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Beginnings
Seymour Cray Jr. was born in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, in 1925 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. His father, a civil engineer, encouraged his love for science and engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Cray developed an affinity for chemistry, performed electrician work for his junior prom, and showed talent in radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

After serving as an electrician in the army, Cray attended the University of Minnesota on the GI Bill, earning a bachelor's in electrical engineering and a master's in applied math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. In 1950, he joined Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in St. Paul, Minnesota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## ERA
ERA was established by the US Navy after World War II to retain elite code-breakers from the Communications Supplementary Activity - Washington (CSAW) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The company was set up as a for-profit entity to hire the old team at higher salaries, focusing initially on code-breaking machines to break Soviet codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Operating largely in secret, ERA soon transitioned to general-purpose computers, utilizing technologies like magnetic drum memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. One of their first products, the ERA 1101, was a commercial version of a device sold to a precursor of the NSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Minnesota, with its strong military presence, was a premier computing center in the 1950s, preceding Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Working With Cray
Despite his young age (25), Cray proved to be a highly talented and focused worker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. He possessed unshakable confidence, rigid discipline, and a brilliant understanding of binary numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Cray was tasked with developing the control system for the ERA 1103, a job requiring deep knowledge of the computer's internal workings to efficiently execute programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. He quickly rose to supervise a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

Similar to [[contributions_of_an_wang_to_computing | An Wang]] of Wang Labs, Cray's genius could make him a difficult boss, as he preferred working alone and would reassign tasks and complete them himself if he felt they weren't being done correctly or quickly enough, a practice known as "being scrayed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Nevertheless, he was generally liked and respected by colleagues, despite his eccentric and enigmatic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Rand Acquisition and Tensions
In December 1951, ERA was sold to Remington Rand by its president, John Parker, without informing employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This angered key workers like William Norris, who was then VP of Operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Remington Rand had also previously acquired Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation, known for creating ENIAC, the first programmable digital computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Eckert and Mauchly also pioneered the stored program computer design, which underpins the [[von_neumann_architecture_vs_brain_computing | Von Neumann architecture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, and developed UNIVAC I, famous for predicting the 1952 US presidential election outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

The ERA team accepted the arrangement, with Eckert–Mauchly focusing on business computers and ERA on scientific computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. However, tensions arose due to the differing requirements of business and scientific computing at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Business computers performed simple operations at large scale, while scientific computing required complex calculations with high accuracy, often for hours of computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The Philadelphia-based Eckert–Mauchly team saw the Minnesota-based ERA team as mere "farmers," while the ERA team viewed the Philadelphians as theoreticians who prioritized speed over reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

The situation worsened when Rand merged with Sperry Corporation in 1955 to form Sperry Rand, forcing the two units into one Univac division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. William Norris, now the division's general manager, emphasized ERA's business-oriented approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Sperry Rand's top management expected to acquire a market leader but lacked the capital for R&D and computer leasing, which was a capital-intensive business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Control Data Corporation
In 1957, William Norris left Sperry Rand to found Control Data Corporation (CDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Cray joined him, having grown disillusioned when his project was categorized as "999 Miscellaneous and Other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. CDC began in July 1957 with employees, a vague idea to make computers, and limited funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. To raise capital, CDC conducted an IPO by selling shares to the public for a dollar each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Despite initial skepticism from prominent investors like Warren Buffett, who declined due to a lack of understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, the early IPO enriched the company's 300 initial investors and created new wealth in Minnesota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## The CDC 1604
As the most technical person at CDC, Cray convinced co-founders to focus on scientific computers rather than the commercial market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. He reasoned that clientele like universities and nuclear weapons research labs cared less about marketing or software, and primarily sought serious compute power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Nuclear weapon simulation, for example, required the biggest and fastest computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Cray believed he could build such a machine affordably using transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. He discovered that rejected bipolar transistors, though weak, could be paired in a "Darlington pair" to amplify their output, teaching him that design could overcome substandard components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. In 1958, Norris secured a deal with the US Navy for the CDC 1604 computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. CDC cut salaries and engineers even resorted to swiping free transistor samples to build the computer at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

Released in 1960, the CDC 1604 cost $990,000 (about $10.4 million today) and, at 0.2 megahertz, was the most powerful commercially available computer of its time, qualifying as a supercomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Supercomputers
The term "supercomputer" refers to machines that push the envelope in computing, leading their field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Competitors in this niche market included UNIVAC's Livermore Automatic Reaction Calculator (LARC), released in 1960, which aided Edward Teller in hydrogen bomb simulations and was the world's most powerful computer from 1960 to 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. IBM responded with the IBM 7030 STRETCH supercomputer, designed by Gene Amdahl, which held the crown until 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

While LARC and STRETCH were largely made-to-order (UNIVAC only made two LARC units), Control Data transformed the supercomputer into a commercially successful category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. The 1604 was sold to various institutions, including the University of Illinois and the State of Israel, allowing CDC to become profitable and challenge established giants like Rand and IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## The CDC 6600
After the 1604, Cray advocated for building the fastest possible machine, while CDC management considered attacking the business data processing market with iterations of the 1604 architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Cray believed in the infinite need for compute for new computational modeling forms like Finite Element Analysis, which involves breaking down complex systems into millions of simpler elements for simulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Cray threatened to leave CDC, leading Norris to agree to split the teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. The 35-year-old Cray and his team opened a lab in his hometown of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, to work on the 6600, a machine intended to be 15 times faster than the 1604 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

For the CDC 6600, Cray made significant changes from the 1604's design, which used ferrite magnetic cores, magnetic tape, and germanium transistors in air-cooled pluggable blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. He sourced faster silicon planar transistors from Fairchild, granting a 5x speed boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. To achieve further speed, Cray abandoned the building-block approach, which caused noise and data transmission issues, and switched to denser "cordwood modules" with shorter wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. This necessitated freon gas cooling instead of air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

The 6600 also implemented parallelism, offloading "housekeeping" functions to ten peripheral computers, leaving the eleventh central computer free for high-speed math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. Its instruction set architecture (ISA) was simplified, ditching instructions unrelated to scientific computing, which allowed for "pipelining" tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

CDC delivered its first 6600 to Lawrence Livermore in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Its speed, three times faster than IBM's 7030, shocked IBM's chairman, Thomas J. Watson Jr., who questioned how "34 people - including the janitor" beat the biggest technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. The answer was IBM's reluctance to sacrifice compatibility for speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

## Discontent and Departure from CDC
Despite the 6600's success (over a hundred units sold for $8 million each, or $23 million today) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>, Cray's focus on niche, high-cost machines for about 50 global customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a> conflicted with CDC's growing belief that peripherals and services, not hardware, were the company's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

CDC followed the 6600 with the 7600, hailed as the world's fastest computer (five times faster than the 6600) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>, but it sold poorly due to frequent breakdowns and a weak economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. The subsequent 8600, aiming for an 8-nanosecond clock cycle, required parts to be squeezed so close that Cray couldn't figure out how to cool them sufficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. In 1971, amidst CDC's expensive antitrust lawsuit against IBM and cash flow issues, Cray was asked to cut expenses by 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Unwilling to compromise his design, he cut his own salary to minimum wage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. When Norris informed him that a redo of the 8600 could not be done due to pre-sold systems, Cray decided to leave and start his own company in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

## [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research and Development of the Cray1]]
Seymour Cray founded [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research]] with $2.5 million, 20% of which was his own money, and bank loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. The company's goal was to build the biggest computer, one at a time, like a master artisan, focusing on research over manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Control Data, in a show of goodwill, invested a quarter-million dollars in the new company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

For his first computer, the Cray-1, Seymour Cray sought revolutionary performance by turning to vector processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Unlike scalar processing, which handles single data items one at a time, vector processing processes single-dimension arrays of data (vectors), drastically reducing instruction count for repetitive operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

Control Data had explored vector processing with its STAR-100, but it was complicated and failed to live up to promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Cray studied the STAR-100, identifying its slow scalar processing and inefficient vector processing implementation, where loading and storing vectors took too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. His solution was "vector registers," fast intermediate memory systems that acted like cache to improve speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

Cray also adopted integrated circuits for the first time, increasing density and reducing wiring, making the Cray-1 much smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. While ICs were mature, Cray's approach was to use older, more reliable technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. For memory, he broke his principle and used newer bipolar semiconductor memory chips for cost, density, and lower power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. The Cray-1 had a clock cycle of 12.5 nanoseconds, making it five times faster than the CDC 7600, requiring all wires to be less than four feet long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. Its iconic circular shape accommodated a new cooling scheme and added aesthetic flair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

## The Cray-1's Stir
The Cray-1, released in 1976, made a huge stir with its flashy look and world-beating speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. A hundred Cray-1s were sold to government and university labs, generating significant revenue growth for [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. IBM didn't even try to compete, and Control Data, Cray's former employer, struggled to keep up with its own complicated vector computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>, eventually suffering losses and selling off its assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

## New Pressures and [[challenges_and_legacy_of_seymour_crays_work | Challenges and Legacy of Seymour Crays Work]]
As the Cray-1 neared completion, Seymour Cray began looking to the Cray-2, aiming for a clock speed three to six times faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. This ambition faced obstacles, including heating challenges due to wire length limitations (40 centimeters for the Cray-2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

However, the business side of [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research]] demanded his attention. The company's success led to an IPO and the need to staff up significantly to address a large backlog, growing from 300 to 5,000 employees at its peak in Chippewa Falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

Cray's original preference for scientific computing because users wrote their own software, allowing him to focus solely on hardware, was challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. Customers increasingly sought software portability and a better Cray-1 rather than a radically different Cray-2 that would require extensive software rewrites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.

Cray Research's management adopted a dual approach, extending the Cray-1 line with the 1S while allowing Seymour Cray to step down as Chairman in 1981 to become an independent contractor and focus on the Cray-2 in Boulder, Colorado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

### The Cray X-MP
The Cray-2, released in 1985 after three false starts on its cooling system, famously resembled an aquarium due to its liquid immersion cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. However, it was unexpectedly upstaged by the Cray X-MP supercomputer, developed by a separate team led by Les Davis and Steve Chen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

The X-MP introduced parallel processing with four CPUs and new solid-state storage semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. Released in 1983, it was the world's fastest supercomputer, 2-5 times faster than the 1S, without the radical design changes of the Cray-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. The X-MP sold nearly 200 units compared to just 24 Cray-2 units by 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

### Increasing Competition
Throughout the 1980s, new supercomputer competitors emerged, notably from Japan (Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC) who leveraged their advantages in VLSI semiconductor production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. While Cray still held 56% market share in traditional supercomputers in 1988, Japanese companies collectively held 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.

New supercomputer startups like Thinking Machines and nCUBE explored new approaches beyond vector computing, such as Massively Parallel Systems (MPPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. These systems used many commercial microprocessors, offering far better price for performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. This combined competition from startups, Japan, and Control Data's spinoff ETA Systems put pressure on Cray Research to refine its product lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. These developments represent a key aspect of the [[evolution_of_supercomputing_technology | Evolution of Supercomputing Technology]].

## Cray Leaves Cray
The success of the X-MP complicated future development. Steve Chen, an X-MP designer touted as the "next Seymour Cray," had an aggressive vision for the MP line (64 processors, custom ICs, optical interconnects) that exceeded [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research's]] financial capacity in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. Chen subsequently left to found Supercomputer Systems, which went bankrupt in 1993 despite $150 million in investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.

In 1989, Seymour Cray left [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research]] to join a spinoff, Cray Computer Corporation (CCC), in Colorado, to work on the Cray-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. The Cray-3 aimed to use gallium arsenide semiconductors for much faster switching performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. However, the Cray-3 fell behind schedule, and orders were canceled in 1991 due to cratering defense demand after the fall of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. CCC sold only one system before filing for bankruptcy in 1995, and a planned Cray-4 never materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>. Cray's preferred approach of starting "with a clean sheet of paper" for "big iron" supercomputers was no longer financially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>.

Seymour Cray formed a new company, SRC Computers, to explore parallel designs, but he passed away in 1996 at age 71 from car accident injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research]] was eventually sold to Silicon Graphics and is now part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as Cray Inc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. This highlights the [[challenges_and_legacy_of_seymour_crays_work | Challenges and Legacy of Seymour Crays Work]] within a changing industry.

## Conclusion
Advancements in semiconductor technology have made past supercomputers seem slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. In 2010, an electrical engineer successfully emulated the Cray-1A supercomputer using a Xilinx Spartan-3E development board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. Today, leading semiconductor makers face similar challenges to Cray, including thermal problems, interconnect issues, and slowdowns from memory retrieval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>. However, unlike Seymour Cray, the industry cannot simply "throw it all out, and start anew with a fresh sheet of paper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.

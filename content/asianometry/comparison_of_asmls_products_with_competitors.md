[[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] holds market leadership in the semiconductor lithography sector, defined by two key factors: the technological superiority of its products and its strong record of collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Technological Superiority and Cost

[[Technological advances in lithography tools by ASML | ASML]]'s products, such as its [[overview_of_asml_lithography_machines | lithography machines]], are highly advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While they are approximately twice as expensive as competing products from Nikon or Canon, they offer significantly better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]]'s machines can print in greater detail and at a higher rate compared to their competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Customers prioritize this superior performance over the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

Specifically, [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography]] is the most advanced lithography technology currently available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Its commercialization with the TWINSCAN NXE series is expected to be more cost-effective for sub-10nm nodes than other techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## Business Model Differentiation

A key differentiator for [[ASMLs rise in the photolithography industry | ASML]] from its competitors like Canon and Nikon lies in its supply chain strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

*   **[[Supply chain management of ASML | ASML]]**: Operates primarily as a system integrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Approximately 90% of the components for its lithography machine modules are manufactured by 500-600 external companies within [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]]'s outsourced supplier network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This network is considered extremely critical and unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. [[ASML]] also leans heavily on its suppliers for expertise on how to best use their components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, such as its strategic alliance with [[Carl Zeisss partnership with ASML | Carl Zeiss AG]] for precision optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Canon and Nikon**: These companies tend to keep most of their manufacturing and component production in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

This outsourced model allows [[ASML]] to acquire module components without needing to specialize in every single part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. It also provides flexibility to adapt to changing technology trends, such as the shift to [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. By maintaining a system integrator role, [[ASML]] positions itself at the "capstone" of the enterprise, dictating customer requirements and component integration, which allows for significant economic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

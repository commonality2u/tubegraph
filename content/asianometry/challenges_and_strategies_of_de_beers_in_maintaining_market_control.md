De Beers has famously maintained significant control over the global diamond market for over a century, despite various challenges. This control has historically ensured that diamond prices have little to no relation to their extraction costs, which are around $58 to $60 per carat, remaining stable for 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This high pricing is largely due to the management of supply by cartels, releasing only a few diamonds each year to maintain steady prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Historical Market Control
For centuries, market entities have attempted to control diamond supply to manipulate prices upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Even in antiquity, when Indian kings dominated production, prices far exceeded extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. When new diamonds were discovered in Brazil in 1725, leading to a significant price drop, the Portuguese Crown quickly took control of mines to limit supply and restore prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Rise of De Beers
The most famous supply cartel emerged with De Beers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The discovery of the Eureka diamond in South Africa in 1866 led to a mining rush, increasing production from 100,000 carats in 1870 to 3 million carats in 1880 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Cecil Rhodes's Consolidation
Cecil Rhodes founded the De Beers Mining Company amidst this boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Rhodes managed his company efficiently, mining diamonds more effectively than competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. He also significantly reduced labor costs by housing migrant workers, who were often prisoners, in closed compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This "investment in labor" reduced labor costs from 36% in 1883 to just over 26% in 1887, giving De Beers the financial strength to buy out competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. By 1888, Rhodes and De Beers had consolidated the South African diamond mining industry and imposed production limits to stabilize prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### The Central Selling Organization (CSO)
After Rhodes's death, Ernst Oppenheimer, founder of Anglo-American, took over as chairman of De Beers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Under his leadership, De Beers established agreements with other diamond producers to sell all their raw production to the Central Selling Organization (CSO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The CSO bought diamonds at a fixed price, guaranteeing a profit, and then resold them in "sites" (sales events) to jewelry cutting factories known as "site holders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

Site holders followed a strict ritual:
*   They informed the CSO of their diamond needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   They were presented with a box of diamonds and were not allowed to negotiate the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   They had to purchase the entire box and could not resell any rough diamonds on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Those who didn't follow the rules were excluded from the arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Marketing Operations
The CSO also managed the industry's marketing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In 1938, Harry Oppenheimer, Ernst's son, collaborated with N.W. Ayer of New York to create a marketing campaign linking diamonds with romance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This campaign used influencer marketing, content marketing, and smart advertising to build the diamond brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>:
*   Movie stars wore diamonds in films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   News articles were planted about celebrities acquiring fine diamonds, likening them to fine art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   The famous 1949 slogan "A diamond is forever" was introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

This campaign was highly successful, making diamonds a pinnacle of luxury and a wedding fixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Challenges to De Beers' Control

### Emergence of [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds_and_their_impact_on_the_market | Synthetic Diamonds]]
For centuries, people sought to create their own diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Early attempts to synthesize diamonds by applying high pressure and heat to carbon were largely unsuccessful with existing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. A key breakthrough came in 1915 when Gilbert Lewis and Merle Randall showed that diamond and graphite were in equilibrium at 10,000 atmospheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This led to a "road map" of necessary conditions: around 2000 degrees Celsius and over a million pounds per square inch of pressure, or less with a metal catalyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

#### Early Synthetic Production
In February 1953, researchers at the General Swedish Electrical Limited Company (ASEA) produced the first synthetic diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. They used a complex device applying immense pressure and heat (2000 degrees Celsius) with an iron solvent to create small crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. ASEA did not immediately publicize or patent their work, allowing GE's later success to overshadow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

In 1951, GE formed a group to produce synthetic diamonds, as the company was a major consumer, using 100 million carats (20 tons) as grit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Their efforts were driven by supply chain concerns regarding reliance on overseas sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. GE developed a "belt apparatus" capable of exerting three million pounds per square inch at 3400 degrees Celsius, directly transitioning carbon into small diamond crystals without a solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

News of GE's success initially threatened the perception of natural gemstone diamonds as unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. However, these early synthetic diamonds were very small (about one millimeter wide), posing no immediate threat to De Beers, which dealt in larger stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. While larger synthetics could be grown, they were typically dark, low-quality, and better suited for industrial uses than jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

#### Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)
The High Pressure/High Temperature (HPHT) method used by GE had limitations. Researchers began exploring low-pressure environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. From 1952-1953, William Eversole of Union Carbide experimented with chemical vapor deposition (CVD), where carbon-containing gas attaches to a seed diamond without high pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

Dr. John Angus of Case Western Reserve University replicated and continued Eversole's work in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. The key to growing pure, gem-quality CVD diamonds was atomic hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, which suppressed and removed unwanted graphite formation during the growth process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. By the 1980s, a Japanese team accelerated growth using hot filaments or microwaves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. By the 1990s, the CVD industry could make single-crystal synthetic diamonds in various colors, and these gem-quality synthetics began appearing in the jewelry market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

De Beers initially responded by investing in advanced tools like UV fluorescence and X-rays to detect synthetic diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. However, synthetics rapidly eliminated this weakness, reaching a point where identification requires advanced lab tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

### Geopolitical Shifts and New Competitors
De Beers faced other major challenges throughout the 1950s and 1960s:
*   Maintaining cartel control despite revolutionary politics in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   Dealing with monumental new diamond discoveries in Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
Despite these, De Beers maintained market power, even reaching a semi-secret agreement with the Soviet Union. Although mining only 25-40% of the supply, the company marketed and sold 80% of global output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

The 1990s brought massive changes to the diamond industry:
*   Japan's rise as a luxury jewelry market in the late 1980s boosted the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   The fall of the Soviet Union and new deposits in Australia introduced new competitors, breaking apart the old cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   Former De Beers customer Lev Leviev purchased diamond factories and struck agreements with the newly established Russian monopoly Alrosa, building one of the first truly independent competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   Australian mining giant BHP, possessing the Argyle diamond mine, stayed out of the cartel and took market share from De Beers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

By the turn of the century, De Beers had to acknowledge it no longer spoke for the entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

## De Beers' Evolving Strategies

### Restructuring as a Luxury Company
In 2000, De Beers restructured into a more traditional luxury company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. They shifted their marketing to promote only De Beers-affiliated dealers and partnered with Louis Vuitton to open their own branded retail ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

### Embracing Synthetics
In 2020, De Beers announced it would start producing and selling its own synthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This move appears to be an attempt to lean into the technological advancements of the synthetic diamond industry and benefit from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## Parallel to the Pearl Market
This strategic shift harks back to a market transition in another valuable good: pearls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Historically, pearls were natural gems harvested from the wild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. However, in the 1910s, Japan pioneered cultured pearl farming, and consumers preferred these synthetic pearls for their rounder, better look, and environmental friendliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. After a difficult market transition in the 1920s, virtually every pearl found in jewelry shops today is cultured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

Similarly, modern gem-quality CVD synthetic diamonds are often more beautiful and ideal-looking, better for the environment, produced with less exploited labor, and far cheaper than natural diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. In this sense, synthetic diamonds are "breaking" the diamond market, shifting value from the scarcity of the stone itself to the scarcity of a luxury brand like De Beers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

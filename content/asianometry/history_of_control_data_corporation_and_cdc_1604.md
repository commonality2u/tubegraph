## Beginnings of Seymour Cray

Seymour Cray Jr. was born in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, in 1925, the son of a civil engineer who fostered his love for science and engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Cray showed an early talent for radio work, did electrician work for his junior prom, and adored chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. After serving as an army electrician, he attended the University of Minnesota, graduating with a bachelor's in electrical engineering and a master's in applied math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

In 1950, Cray joined Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in St. Paul, Minnesota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Engineering Research Associates (ERA)

During World War II, the US Navy utilized the Communications Supplementary Activity - Washington (CSAW), a team of elite code-breakers, to design and build powerful machines for breaking Axis naval codes, primarily to find German submarines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. After the war, the US Government still needed to break [[soviet_computer_development_history|Soviet codes]], but budget cuts prevented them from retaining all their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The Navy collaborated with investment banker John Parker to establish ERA, a for-profit company that hired the old team at higher salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

ERA operated largely in secret from an old glider factory, initially producing code-breaking machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The team quickly transitioned to useful general-purpose computers, leveraging emerging technologies like magnetic drum memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. One of their first products was the ERA 1101, a commercialized version of a device sold to a precursor of the NSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. In the 1950s, Minnesota was America's premier computing center due to a strong military presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Working With Cray at ERA

Despite being only 25, Cray proved to be a talented worker, quiet yet confident enough to speak up when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. He possessed incredible focus, rigid discipline, and a brilliant understanding of binary numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Cray was tasked with developing the control system for ERA's next computer, the ERA 1103, a role requiring deep knowledge of the computer's internal workings to efficiently execute programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. He quickly rose to supervise a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

Like [[history_and_rise_of_wang_labs|An Wang]] of Wang Labs, Seymour Cray's genius could make him difficult to work for; he preferred working alone, often late into the evenings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. If someone was not performing to his standards, he would reassign them and complete the work himself, a phenomenon known as "being scrayed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Despite this, he was generally liked and respected by colleagues, seen as eccentric and enigmatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Remington Rand and Sperry Rand Acquisitions

In December 1951, John Parker, ERA's president and initial investor, sold the company to Remington Rand without informing employees, which angered key figures like William Norris, ERA's VP of Operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Remington Rand, a typewriter and shaver company, had already acquired the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation, known for creating ENIAC and pioneering the stored program computer design that underpins the Von Neumann architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

The ERA team accepted the arrangement, with Eckert–Mauchly focusing on business computing and ERA on scientific computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. However, tensions arose due to the differing needs of business and scientific computing at the time; business computers handled simple operations at scale, while scientific computers required complex, high-accuracy calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. The Eckert–Mauchly group viewed the Minnesota team as "farmers," while the Minnesota team saw the Philadelphians as theoreticians whose machines frequently broke down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Tensions worsened in 1955 when Rand merged with Sperry Corporation to form Sperry Rand, consolidating the independent units into one Univac division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. William Norris, the division's new general manager, highlighted the disparity by stating, "You people run a laboratory and ERA runs a business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Sperry's top management had mistakenly believed they were acquiring a market leader, and UNIVAC, despite its potential to become like IBM, lacked the necessary capital for R&D and equipment leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Control Data Corporation (CDC)

In 1957, fed up with the situation, William Norris left Sperry Rand to found Control Data Corporation (CDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Seymour Cray joined him, having observed his project being categorized as "999 Miscellaneous and Other" by the accounting system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

CDC began in July 1957 with employees, a vague idea to build computers, and limited funds from friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. To raise capital, CDC conducted an IPO by selling shares to the public on the street for a dollar each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. The company gained early publicity when sports columnist Sid Hartman mentioned their move in the Minneapolis Tribune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Many prominent local investors, including Warren Buffett (Norris's nephew by marriage), declined to invest, believing CDC "didn't have a ghost of a chance" against IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. However, the $1 shares eventually became worth many times more, enriching CDC's 300 initial investors and creating wealth in Minnesota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### The CDC 1604

Cray, as CDC's most technical person, convinced his co-founders to focus on scientific computers rather than the commercial market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. He reasoned that scientific clients, such as universities and nuclear weapons research labs, cared less about marketing or client service and programmed their own software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. These customers primarily needed "serious compute" for complex simulations, like those for nuclear weapon detonations, which required the biggest and fastest computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

Cray was confident he could build such a computer cost-effectively using transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. He sourced reject bipolar transistors for radios from a local electronics shop, which were cheaper than factory-grade ones but outputted a weak signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:04]</a>. Cray ingeniously paired them in a "Darlington pair," where the second transistor amplified the first's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This experience taught him that proper design could compensate for substandard components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

In 1958, with money dwindling, Bill Norris secured a deal with the US Navy for the CDC 1604 computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. To scale production, CDC bought a factory and hired more engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Managers, including Norris, cut their salaries in half, and engineers resorted to using free sales samples from transistor companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

The CDC 1604 launched in 1960, priced at $990,000 (about $10.4 million today) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. At 0.2 megahertz, it was the most powerful commercially available computer of its time, qualifying as a supercomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### Supercomputers in the 1960s

The term "supercomputer" refers to a machine that pushes the envelope in computing, leading its field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Other companies produced super-fast computers for niche customers, such as UNIVAC's Livermore Automatic Reaction Calculator (LARC), released in 1960, which aided Edward Teller in hydrogen bomb simulations and was the world's most powerful computer from 1960 to 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. IBM's response was the IBM 7030 STRETCH supercomputer, designed by Gene Amdahl, which held the crown until 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

However, the LARC and STRETCH were largely made-to-order products, with UNIVAC producing only two LARC units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Control Data, on the other hand, transformed the supercomputer into a commercially successful category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The 1604 was sold to various clients, including the University of Illinois, Lockheed, and the State of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. CDC began turning a profit, challenging older computer giants like Rand and IBM, with its stock rising from $1 to $9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### Post-1604 Developments and Internal Tensions

After the 1604, Cray and CDC debated their next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. While the company could iterate on the 1604 architecture for the lucrative business data processing market, as seen with the successful CDC-160A control applications computer, Cray was singularly focused on building the fastest possible machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. He aimed to feed the "infinite need for compute" driven by new computational modeling like Finite Element Analysis, which required breaking down systems into millions of elements for complex simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Cray threatened to leave if he couldn't pursue his vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Norris eventually agreed to split the teams: one continued working on 1604 follow-ups, while the 35-year-old Cray and his team opened their own lab in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, to develop a machine 15 times faster than the 1604, named the 6600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

CDC's management increasingly believed its future lay in peripherals and services, not just hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. They acquired Commercial Credit, a consumer finance company, to fund their computer leasing strategy, a move that later backfired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. Although over a hundred CDC 6600s were sold to major customers like the Atomic Energy Commission at $8 million each (about $23 million today), the market was limited to about 50 global customers, which Cray considered a feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

CDC followed the 6600 with the 7600, hailed as the world's fastest computer, five times faster than its predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. However, it sold poorly due to frequent breakdowns and a weak economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. The subsequent 8600 supercomputer faced cooling challenges due to its dense design, with Cray eventually deciding to scrap the design and start over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

By 1971, amidst an expensive antitrust lawsuit against IBM, CDC faced cash flow issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. When asked to cut expenses, Cray refused and instead cut his own salary to minimum wage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Norris ultimately told Cray that a complete redesign of the 8600 was impossible as two systems were already pre-sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. In 1972, Seymour Cray left CDC to found [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1|Cray Research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

CDC eventually suffered significant financial losses and was sold off in pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. By the mid-1980s, its most profitable business was Ticketron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

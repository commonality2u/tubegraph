Taiwan is currently experiencing one of its worst droughts in many years, which has significant implications for [[semiconductor_industry_water_usage | semiconductor manufacturing]] in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While northwestern areas like Taipei are generally unaffected due to sufficient reservoirs, other regions such as Tainan, Gaochon, Taitung, and Shinchu are facing severe issues, primarily due to less resilient water infrastructure or greater water demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. TSMC, a major semiconductor manufacturer, has reportedly budgeted millions of dollars to truck water to its fabs in Tainan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Why Semiconductor Manufacturing is Water-Intensive

The [[semiconductor_industry_water_usage | semiconductor industry]] has historically struggled with water usage, a problem that is expected to intensify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. While home residential water saving is important, water usage in agricultural and industrial sectors, particularly [[semiconductor_industry_water_usage | semiconductor manufacturing]], far exceeds it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

A substantial portion of this water is used for washing wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>:
*   **Wafer Cleaning:** Thirty to forty percent of modern wafer fabrication steps involve some form of cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Wet Cleaning:** This process applies sequential wash steps to remove organics, metals, and particles from the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Water is also used to rinse off chemicals between these washing steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **[[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Ultra Pure Water]] (UPW) Requirement:** Semiconductor companies cannot use regular tap water due to particles that could damage the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Instead, they must use [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]], a real industry term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   **Purity Standards:** While [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] is used in other applications like nuclear energy, the cleanliness standards in the semiconductor industry are stricter than almost all others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The aim is to remove "killer particles"—microorganism waste, organic particles, dissolved metals, and gases—that are large enough to affect a chip's nano architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   **Generation Process:** Generating and verifying the purity of [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] is a complex process involving over a dozen steps, many of which are repeated in loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. It takes approximately 6,000 liters (1,600 gallons) of city water to create 3,800 liters (1,000 gallons) of [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. A single 200mm (8-inch) wafer can consume over 5,600 liters (2,000 gallons) of [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Circuit Complexity:** The type of circuits being manufactured also impacts water usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Logic circuits, like microprocessors, have more layers and are more complex than memory ICs, display panels, or solar panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Each layer requires washing and cleaning before the next can be applied, meaning logic circuits require more water and energy for their manufacture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Increasing Demand and [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Challenges]]

In 2020, TSMC's Corporate Social Responsibility report indicated they did not meet their water consumption goals set years prior, achieving only a 5% reduction against a target of 27% in liters of water consumed per 8-inch wafer equivalent layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This shortfall was due to increased demands for process cleanliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. More advanced process nodes require more layers to wash, more [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]], and more stringent standards for that water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. As process nodes shrink, the threshold for a "killer particle" also decreases, making purification harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Consequently, cutting-edge chips today require more water to fabricate than they did ten years ago, despite [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | advances]] in water reuse and conservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This trend is likely to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Wastewater Generation and Treatment

Semiconductor manufacturing processes generate a significant amount of wastewater, much of which requires [[wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | treatment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. In 2013, TSMC's fabs in Tainan generated 19 million tons of wastewater, compared to the entire city of Tainan generating 29 million tons that same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

*   **Pollutants:** Wastewater from wet washing contains high amounts of pollutants like ammonia, phosphate, and fluoride, which have been linked to health concerns for semiconductor workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Varied Treatment Needs:** Not all wastewater is the same; some requires more expensive and extensive [[wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | treatments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. For example, ultraviolet light for disinfection is relatively cheap, but reverse electrodialysis (transporting salt ions through a membrane) costs substantially more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Large Foundries' Approach:** Large foundries like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel separate different wastewater streams and provide specialized [[wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | treatment]] for over 25 chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   **Reuse:** Some of the final treated water is reusable and can be fed back into the system to generate more [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
    *   **Cooling Towers:** Non-reusable water is often directed to cooling towers, where it evaporates, helping to maintain temperatures within the fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This cooling process is the single biggest use of a facility's energy and water after direct manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Smaller Companies:** For many smaller companies, it is more cost-effective to broadly aggregate and treat water, then return it to the city once minimum health and safety requirements are met, getting new raw water from the city for processing into [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Recycling Rates:** Due to their scale, large fabs *must* implement water reuse and recycling [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | technologies]] to avoid running out of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. In 2017, TSMC's recycle rate was 87% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, significantly higher than the average semiconductor fab's 42% in a 2017 Singapore study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## Water Sourcing and Conservation [[strategies_for_addressing_workforce_shortages_in_semiconductor_industry | Strategies]]

In 2019, TSMC's fabs in Tainan alone consumed 50,000 metric tons (50 million liters) of water daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Sourcing this raw water is a major [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenge]], especially since the area relies on the Nan Hua and Zheng One reservoirs, which are currently at dangerously low capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Taiwan's south is also its agricultural heart, requiring water to feed the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

To prevent draining the area's water supply, companies like TSMC have optimized their water draw and usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>:
*   **Rainwater Collection:** TSMC has built large rain collection systems to capture rainwater and store it in 700-ton tanks. After checks, this water can be processed for landscaping or sent to sewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Water Reclamation Plants:** The company has signed tenders to build water reclamation plants near its fabs, recycling industrial wastewater using advanced methods like reverse osmosis, hollow fiber ultrafiltration, and sand filtration, similar to Singapore's "new water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The first facilities are in Tainan Science Park, with more planned for the Yeongkong and Unping areas of Tainan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## [[economic_impacts_of_semiconductor_facilities_on_water_resources | Economic Impacts of Semiconductor Facilities on Water Resources]]

Intel and other companies are also building fabs in Arizona, a desert state where 40% of total water demand is met by non-renewable groundwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The Colorado River and other surface water sources account for 57%, with reclaimed water making up the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Shortfalls in the Colorado River are often compensated by pumping groundwater, which is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Historically, Arizona's state government has managed water usage by transferring water from farms to cities, as agriculture consumes almost 90% of total water demand in the American Southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Turning farmland into cities and suburbs has helped curb overall water usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. However, despite attempts at coordinated water management, groundwater pumping remains a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

The decision to place semiconductor fabs in water-scarce regions like Arizona is driven by two main reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>:
1.  **Profitability and Value:** High-volume [[semiconductor_industry_water_usage | semiconductor manufacturing]] is an extremely profitable and high-value industry, making states willing to bear the costs of building water infrastructure or reallocating water from other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. A 2012 paper comparing land usages in Chandler, Arizona (where fabs will be located), found that the [[economic_impacts_of_semiconductor_facilities_on_water_resources | economic benefits of semiconductor manufacturing]] outweigh the costs of providing water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Governments are highly incentivized to attract these facilities due to high per-acre revenue, largely from property taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
2.  **Water Recycling Capabilities:** The semiconductor industry is affluent enough to invest heavily in water-saving, reusing, and recycling [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. This means a theoretically high percentage of water, much higher than in other land usages, can be returned to the wastewater system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Therefore, for foundries, the other advantages Arizona offers—such as a ready supply of educated talent, tax incentives, and seismic stability—outweigh the simple lack of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Political Consequences

High-value [[semiconductor_industry_water_usage | semiconductor manufacturing]] is so profitable that governments are more likely to secure water for it by reallocating shares from others, typically farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This has been observed in both Taiwan and Arizona, where farmers' water allocations are being cut and diverted to tech companies <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Agriculture is the primary user of water almost everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. There is an argument that much agriculture, as currently practiced, is not an economically efficient use of precious water, especially if sourced from groundwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. However, such reallocations carry political consequences, as farmers are valuable constituents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Governments must delicately balance these interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

The semiconductor industry's thirst is not expected to diminish as Moore's Law continues to drive [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | advancements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Water recycling, reduction, and reuse [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | technologies]] must keep pace to ensure sufficient water availability for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

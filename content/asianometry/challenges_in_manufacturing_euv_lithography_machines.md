[[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] is a crucial provider of semiconductor lithography machinery to leading foundries such as Intel and TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite high demand for its products, [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]]'s CEO has stated the company can only produce 50 high-end [[extreme_ultraviolet_lithography_and_its_challenges | EUV]] lithography machines per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Without these machines, foundries face limitations in producing more 5nm chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The immense [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenge]] lies in coordinating and integrating thousands of parts from various suppliers into a single, smooth-running machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The ASML Supply Chain

[[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] operates as a global, sprawling company, with its primary factory in the Netherlands and additional manufacturing and R&D sites in Connecticut and California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Its products are akin to airplanes in their complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Structure and Scale
[[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] functions as a system integrator, similar to Boeing or Airbus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. They select, procure, and assemble outputs from a vast network of different suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Lithography machines, like the TWINSCAN series, are constructed from independent modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Approximately 90% of the components for these modules are sourced from 500-600 external companies within [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]]'s outsourced supplier network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This network is a key differentiator from competitors like Canon and Nikon, who tend to handle more processes in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

The supplier network is globally distributed:
*   300 suppliers are based in the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   Another 100 are in other parts of Europe, primarily Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   The remainder are largely in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Coordinating within this global network is critical, as [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] relies heavily on its suppliers for expertise on component usage, just as its customers rely on [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] for product training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. An example is the strategic alliance with German company Carl Zeiss AG, a specialist in precision optics, which produces the critical lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Reasons for Outsourcing
While [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] occasionally acquires supplier companies for unique expertise (e.g., Brion Technologies for computational lithography, Cymer for lasers), it largely maintains a system integrator role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Several reasons underpin this strategy:
1.  **Focus on Core Competencies:** [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] can acquire module components without needing to become world-leading experts in every specific part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. A single lithography stepper can incorporate over 1,600 individual components, with 200 being expensive or time-consuming to procure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This allows [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] to maintain a big-picture view without getting bogged down in minutiae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
2.  **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Outsourcing provides flexibility to adapt to changing technology trends, such as the radical shift required for [[extreme_ultraviolet_lithography_and_its_challenges | EUV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This avoids sunk costs associated with investing resources in now-defunct technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
3.  **Economic Value and Influence:** The system integrator role positions [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] at the apex of the enterprise, giving them final say on part selection and direct communication with customer requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This role captures the most economic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] is often the single most important customer for its suppliers, sometimes accounting for 50% or more of their revenues, granting [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] strong influence over their operations and planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Many suppliers are too specialized to diversify away from [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Manufacturing Process

### Order to Delivery
The process begins with clients like Intel, Samsung, or TSMC forecasting their future demand, often a year or more in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. They then order a machine from [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]], specifying a delivery date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Clients choose from over 30 client-specific options, meaning no two machines are exactly alike, which explains why different foundries can achieve varied results even with the same supplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

Upon receiving an order, [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]]'s Supply Chain Planning Department creates a Master Production Schedule (MPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This MPS details production start and end times, considering resource needs, workforce hours, component lead times, and customer deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Suppliers are then notified and issued purchase orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

The manufacturing workflow includes:
*   **ASSY (Assembly):** Modules are built independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **FASY (Final Assembly):** Modules are integrated into the complete machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Test:** The machine undergoes testing to meet internal benchmarks, with configurations adjusted for performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Disassembly and Delivery:** Once [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] standards are met, the machine is disassembled, packed, and shipped to the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Over 80% of customers are in Asia, requiring long flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Installation:** [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] technicians collaborate with foundry technicians to install the device into a fab clean room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### Post-Delivery Support
[[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] is responsible for the machine's upkeep and service time post-delivery, signing service contracts with uptime Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. These contracts can hold [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] financially liable for lost sales due to machine downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] provides 24/7 support from local technology development and training sites in numerous countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Spare parts are kept at local service warehouses, with a central warehouse shipping parts within 14 days if local stock is unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Quality Control and Supply Chain Dynamics
To minimize breakdowns, [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] enforces rigid quality control standards on its suppliers, following a "zero defects" policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Every part is closely inspected and rejected if found to have defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

The supply chain is described as a "symphony of chaos and nervous tension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Planners must account for:
*   Part rejections on the factory floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   Possible disruptions and transport issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

If a non-critical part is rejected or missing, workers may use a "dummy part" to stay on schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. However, if a mission-critical part is affected, production can halt, jeopardizing the entire module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

A significant challenge is the long lead times for certain critical parts, particularly lenses and lasers, which can take up to 40 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This means some work must begin long before actual customer orders are placed, making it impossible to expedite production overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

The cost of [[extreme_ultraviolet_lithography_and_its_challenges | EUV]] equipment is substantial, with each machine costing $150 million—comparable to a Boeing airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Individual components and replacements can easily exceed a million dollars each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## [[extreme_ultraviolet_lithography_and_its_challenges | EUV]] Manufacturing Challenges

[[extreme_ultraviolet_lithography_and_its_challenges | Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography]] ([[development_of_uv_and_euv_lithography_technology | EUV]]) is the most advanced lithography technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, with commercialization expected to be more cost-effective for sub-10nm nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. While the technology dates back to the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, its [[challenges_in_developing_commercial_euv_systems | commercialization]] required a revolutionary re-engineering of traditional semiconductor fabrication principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, necessitating a complete re-jigging of [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]]'s entire supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### The [[engineering_challenges_of_the_euv_light_source | EUV Light Source]]
A key [[challenges_in_developing_commercial_euv_systems | challenge]] for [[extreme_ultraviolet_lithography_and_its_challenges | EUV]] lithography is achieving sufficient wafer etching throughput while avoiding substantial yield defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Since [[extreme_ultraviolet_lithography_and_its_challenges | EUV]] mirrors have low reflectivity (less than 70%), a very powerful light source is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This is achieved by firing a CO2 laser at tin droplets to create plasma and ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The use of droplets is critical to reduce tin debris, preventing contamination of the mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This specific method was developed after experimenting with various other techniques like rotating cylinders, thin target tapes, spray jets, and liquid filaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. The tight margin of error for the power source has had repercussions across the entire supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Cleanliness Standards and Pellicles
In older lithography methods, a pellicle (a 1-micrometer polymer film) is used to prevent particles from casting "shadow" discrepancies on etched wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. However, in the [[extreme_ultraviolet_lithography_and_its_challenges | EUV]] world, even super-thin traditional pellicles can absorb and weaken [[extreme_ultraviolet_lithography_and_its_challenges | EUV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. While [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] worked to develop a suitable pellicle (recently announced as available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>), earlier generations of [[extreme_ultraviolet_lithography_and_its_challenges | EUV]] machines required the entire supply chain to adhere to ultra-strict cleanliness standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

A particle as small as 52 nm (the size of a small virus) can contaminate an [[extreme_ultraviolet_lithography_and_its_challenges | EUV]] supply component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Maintaining such cleanliness pushes the limits of technical possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This required:
*   Installation of new proprietary detectors at all supplier premises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   Addition of particle flushing steps throughout the entire build process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

These [[challenges_in_developing_commercial_euv_systems | challenges]] were a primary reason for the decades-long delay in [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV commercialization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. The recent availability of pellicles is expected to improve wafer yields and reduce costs by lessening the need for such stringent cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The hard disk drive (HDD) was once the most expensive component in a personal computer and remains a complex piece of technology, utilizing magnetically enabled heads flying over glass platters to read or write vast amounts of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This article explores the birth, boom, and bust of the Hard Disk Drive industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Beginnings

In 1952, IBM appointed Reynold B. Johnson, a former high school teacher and talented inventor, to lead a new research laboratory in San Jose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Johnson had previously invented a machine for grading pencil-marked multiple-choice tests, which IBM acquired the rights to before hiring him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. San Jose was chosen for the lab's location due to its position between major IBM customers in Los Angeles and Seattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Johnson's team was given broad freedom to pursue various projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. One significant project involved developing a random access processing system to replace "tub files," which were part of punched card systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Tub files allowed for random access—retrieving any piece of information in a sequence at roughly the same time—which was superior to sequential access where the entire sequence must be cycled through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Disks

The IBM team focused on magnetic recording systems to achieve this random access function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. These systems store data on magnetic media, which is then read or written by a mounted head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. After evaluating various magnetic media forms, including tape, drums, plates, wires, and rods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, Johnson opted for a stack of rotating magnetic disks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This format offered significant surface area for its size and the potential for simultaneous data access across multiple disks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

An early prototype featured about 120 aluminum disks, two feet wide and spaced a quarter-inch apart, stacked on a shaft and spinning at 3,600 revolutions per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Building RAMAC

Two major technical challenges arose during development:
1.  **Even Application of Iron Oxide Paint**: An engineer suggested spinning the disks at high speed and pouring iron oxide paint (the same used for the Golden Gate Bridge) onto the center, allowing it to spread uniformly. This technique is now known as "spin-on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
2.  **Disk Wobble**: To maintain the read/write heads a consistent thousandth of an inch above the disk surface despite wobble, a team led by Bill Goddard and John Lynott integrated an air nozzle into the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This created an air cushion that kept the head stable while a single arm moved it up and down to the correct disk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

In 1956, IBM introduced the 305 “Random Access Method of Accounting and Control” or RAMAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. RAMAC was a transaction processing system built around what is recognized as the first hard drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This drive consisted of 50 iron oxide-coated disks, each about 61 centimeters wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. It cost a quarter of a million dollars, stored approximately 4.4 megabytes, and was the size of two refrigerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Despite these seemingly modest specs today, its mechanical marvel allowed data retrieval in less than a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. IBM President Thomas Watson Jr. declared it the "greatest product day in IBM's history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The first RAMAC was shipped to the Zellerbach Paper Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## An Industry is Born

IBM established the disk drive as an essential computer component, thus birthing an industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Other computer manufacturers like General Electric and Burroughs began producing their own HDDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Independent disk companies, such as Bryant Computer Products and Data Products, emerged to supply third-party drives to those lacking the expertise or capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. By the mid-1960s, Japanese firms like NEC, Fujitsu, and Hitachi also started producing hard drives, initially for internal use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

In 1966, IBM introduced its 2314 File Facility and disk packs, offering improved speed and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Its 29-megabyte disk pack format simplified storage swapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This led to a new wave of independent companies copying the disk pack format and marketing "plug compatible" products to IBM customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Winchester

IBM continued to lead with [[key_innovations_and_technological_advancements_in_hard_disk_drives | innovations]] in hard disk drive storage throughout the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Their most significant contribution was the introduction of the Winchester drive in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The name originated from IBM San Jose manager Kenneth E. Haughton, who, hearing the project's specification for two 30-megabyte spindles referred to as a "30-30," quipped, "If it's a 30-30, then it must be a Winchester" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

Previous disk packs were removable and accessible, but this led to particle contamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The Winchester design sealed off the disks, their individual arms, and motors within a dust-proof container <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This not only resolved contamination issues but also allowed for greater storage capacity by significantly reducing the distance between the head and the disk surface to a thousandth of what it was with RAMAC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. A closer head enabled higher data density, cutting the cost-per-megabyte by 30% over competing designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The Winchester design became an industry standard, setting the blueprint for all subsequent HDDs, to the extent that for a long time, HDDs were simply called "Winchester Drives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Shugart

Alan Shugart, an engineer involved in the early development of the Winchester drive, had a notable career in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Born during the Great Depression, he joined IBM's San Jose lab after graduating from the University of the Redlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. At IBM, Shugart led various memory projects, including the development of a small, cheap read-only device for transferring programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Released in 1973 as the "Type 1 Diskette," this device is now commonly known as the floppy disk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Shugart left IBM in 1969 after being transferred to New York, a move he strongly disliked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. He then joined Memorex for three years before founding his own company, Shugart Associates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Despite clashing with co-founders and leaving, Shugart Associates went on to dominate the 8-inch and then 5.25-inch commercial floppy drive markets, eventually being acquired by Xerox in 1977 for $41 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Shugart 2

After his first venture, Alan Shugart founded another company in Scotts Valley, Santa Cruz County <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Originally named Shugart Technology, it was too similar to his previous company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. He eventually settled on Seagate, aiming for a name starting with S, ending with T, and containing a G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

In founding Seagate, Shugart sought to adapt IBM's Winchester drive for the burgeoning microcomputer market (PCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. PC-makers had adopted Shugart Associates' 5.25-inch floppy drive (a size requested by Dr. An Wang of Wang Laboratories, who found the original 8-inch floppy too large and expensive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Seagate aimed to build a hard disk drive that would fit in the same space but offer significantly more capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

In 1980, Seagate announced their ST506 hard drive, which offered 5 megabytes of storage, far surpassing a floppy disk's 160 kilobytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Despite costing over $1,000, it was an immediate success, contributing to Seagate's revenues of $9.8 million in 1981, followed by $40 million and $110 million in subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

## Engineering Marvels

The core concept of HDDs, from RAMAC to the 5.25-inch HDD, has remained consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. They consist of four key sub-components: platters, motors, read-write heads, and supporting electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Data bits are stored on tracks on double-sided glass platters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, which are mounted on spindles and spun by motors at 3,600 to 7,200 times per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The data is accessed by heads that "fly" over the platters, positioned by actuators and monitored by electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

While the core concept is similar, the engineering to achieve it has been completely overhauled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Seagate's first 5-megabyte Winchester HDD was an engineering marvel, described by Seagate's engineering VP Doug Mahon as "a Boeing 747 flying at Mach 4 just an inch off the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Today, heads fly as little as 3 nanometers above the disk surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Producing these machines demands significant capital expenditure for components, assembly in cleanrooms, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## [[factors_leading_to_the_commoditization_and_eventual_bust_of_the_hdd_market | Commoditization]]

Despite the advanced engineering, the HDD market became commoditized due to several [[factors_leading_to_the_commoditization_and_eventual_bust_of_the_hdd_market | factors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>:
*   **Commodity Nature of Memory**: Computer memory, especially secondary memory, is generally a commodity, with customers prioritizing more storage and willing to switch suppliers to get it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **Lack of Brand Value**: "Brand value" never gained traction in the HDD industry; users typically upgraded PCs for new operating systems or CPUs, not specific HDD brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **PC Assembler Pressure**: PC assemblers, notably IBM, played HDD makers against each other, purchasing from suppliers who met specifications at the lowest price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. IBM sourced almost all HDDs for its growing PC business in the early 1980s from startups, demanding heavy qualification and second-sourcing without long-term contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. For example, IBM's 1983 PC-XT primarily sourced its 10-megabyte HDD from Seagate, MiniScribe, and IMI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## Piling In

The modular design of HDDs contributed to market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Only platters and read/write heads primarily influence storage capacity and performance, allowing new firms to tweak these parts, integrate them, and quickly introduce new products to a market hungry for [[key_innovations_and_technological_advancements_in_hard_disk_drives | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

Early HDD firms also did not rigorously protect their trade knowledge and [[key_innovations_and_technological_advancements_in_hard_disk_drives | innovations]] with patents, fostering a community where ideas flowed freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. When a new firm developed a hit format or technology, competitors quickly duplicated it, eroding profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

For instance, the Scottish firm Rodime patented the 3.5-inch HDD format in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. However, it gained substantial popularity in 1986 when Conner Peripherals sold it in large quantities to Compaq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. The format's popularity brought massive competition, which Rodime could not match in scale and capability, leading to their bankruptcies in 1989 and 1991, and their evolution into a patent troll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

Another example is Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR), a Nobel-winning quantum effect that revolutionized the HDD's read/write head, enabling greater area density and storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Although discovered in Europe, IBM first commercialized GMR in 1997 with a 16.8 Gigabyte HDD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. American competitors Seagate and Read-Rite introduced their GMR heads by 1999, and Japanese firms like Toshiba rapidly licensed or acquired GMR technology, announcing their first GMR-equipped HDDs in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Toshiba's tiny 1.8-inch HDD, a later GMR product, found its famous use in the Apple iPod in 2002, thanks to Steve Jobs and Jon Rubinstein <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

## [[the_rise_and_influence_of_venture_capital_in_the_hdd_industry | Venture Capital]]

A significant [[the_rise_and_influence_of_venture_capital_in_the_hdd_industry | factor]] in the market's dynamics was the influx of venture capital (VC) money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Changes in capital gains tax rates and pension fund investment regulations at the end of the 1970s facilitated the rise of VCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

Seagate's IPO in September 1981, just over a year after its HDD launch, raised $26 million, with VCs making substantial returns (their $1 million investment grew to over $32 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. This success established a precedent for how VCs would invest and exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. By mid-1983, 12 VC-backed HDD manufacturers were publicly traded with a combined market capitalization of $5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

The hot market led VCs to raise large funds and pour money into the disk drive industry, recruiting talented individuals from established companies to found startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. From 1977 to 1984, 43 disk drive manufacturers raised $400 million, with 21 startups alone raising over $270 million in 1983 and 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. With around seventy firms in total, a market pullback in 1983-1984 triggered a major shakeout, with many startups failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This "Zerg rush" of entrants dramatically reshaped the market, as the old vertically integrated HDD companies saw their market share plummet from 84.8% in 1978 to just 7.9% a decade later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

## Globalization

Initially, US firms dominated the industry, but international competition emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. Japanese computer makers (Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC, Toshiba) shifted from internal HDD production to an OEM model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Despite some [[key_innovations_and_technological_advancements_in_hard_disk_drives | innovations]], they struggled to gain significant market share because American firms aggressively globalized their manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

In 1984, Seagate began outsourcing HDD assembly to Singapore, a move followed by other American HDD-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Facilitated by Singapore's Economic Development Board, this policy made Singapore the world's largest HDD producer by 1990, holding 55% of shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. As Singapore's labor costs rose, lower-value work, like actuator arm assembly, moved to other Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia or Thailand, while Singapore took on higher-value tasks such as platter fabrication and specialized HDD system assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

The Japanese eventually caught up by outsourcing their production abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. In the early 2000s, they even captured a majority share of the HDD market when Hitachi merged with IBM, though competition and further mergers later eroded this advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

## Responses

This intense competition and globalization significantly benefited consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. From 1976 to 1987, HDD data density grew 20 times over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. The cost per megabyte of data storage drastically fell from $560 in 1977 to $11.89 in 1986, $6.86 by 1990, and just 4.3 cents by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

However, this situation was unsustainable. As the technology matured, companies began exiting the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. The number of HDD firms peaked at 66 in 1990, then halved to 33 in the next four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. By 1998, only 16 firms remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. Even after this shakeout, the market still had too many players; between 2006 and 2015, the top four HDD vendors had an average market share of only 52.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

Between 2000 and 2010, four more major HDD firms—Quantum, IBM, Maxtor, and Fujitsu—exited the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. These laggards saw no viable path forward other than consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. Even IBM, the inventor of the HDD, decided to exit, merging its HDD operations with Hitachi's in 2002 after struggling to gain more than 25% of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

## Conclusion

Today, three major HDD makers remain: Seagate, Western Digital, and Toshiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. They continue to manage their market share as the HDD gradually fades, increasingly replaced by technologies like Solid State Drives (SSDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. While HDDs are unlikely to be entirely replaced, the significant growth and [[key_innovations_and_technological_advancements_in_hard_disk_drives | innovation]] of the past are largely gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

The [[factors_leading_to_the_commoditization_and_eventual_bust_of_the_hdd_market | fierce competition]] and [[the_rise_and_influence_of_venture_capital_in_the_hdd_industry | aggressive globalization]] undertaken by American firms allowed them to retain significant market share against Asian competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. By the mid-1990s, HDD assembly factories had largely left the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. However, higher-paying American jobs in R&D, head manufacturing, and gimbals have persisted, effectively saved by this strategic shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. The industry's brutal history raises questions about whether alternative architectural or market decisions could have altered its fated trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

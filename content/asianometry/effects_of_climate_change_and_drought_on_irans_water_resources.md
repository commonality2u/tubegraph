Iran is a country historically prone to aridity and low rainfall, with much of its central lands being uninhabitable without adequate water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This long-running water problem is exacerbated by its natural geography and climate, and is increasingly impacted by factors linked to climate change and persistent droughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

## Natural Water Characteristics
Iran's annual average precipitation ranks 158th out of 189 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Furthermore, 75% of this precipitation falls on just 25% of the country's area, with 50% of the rainfall occurring during winter months and only 4% during the summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Certain regions, like the central deserts, receive less than 50 millimeters of rainfall annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

While Iran borders the Caspian Sea to the North and the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman to the South, these large bodies of water are brackish and not drinkable without desalination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Large mountains facing these water bodies receive snowmelt, which creates several rivers. However, with the exception of the Karun River, these rivers are seasonal, often overflowing in spring but having virtually no flow in summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Similarly, most of Iran's ten lakes are very salty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Ultimately, less than 1% of Iran's 1.6 million square kilometers is surface water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Modern Water Challenges and the Impact of Drought
The challenges facing [[challenges_and_reforms_needed_in_irans_water_management_system | Iran's water management system]] are multifaceted, rooted in its arid climate, rapid population growth, and intensive agricultural practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

### Shift from Qanats to Wells and Dams
Historically, ancient Persians developed sophisticated water supply systems called qanats, underground tunnels that brought snowmelt from mountains to plains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. These gravity-fed systems kept water cool and prevented evaporation, making them efficient for arid conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

However, in the 1900s, water needs outgrew the qanats' capacity, especially as nomads were settled into villages, requiring consistent water access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Iran then turned to hydraulic mega-projects like dams and modern water wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Drilling wells for groundwater was quick and easy compared to the laborious qanat construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Authorities pushed for these new systems, leading to qanats falling into disrepair; by 2000, less than 10% of Iran's water came from qanats, down from 75% in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

With only 10.5% of its land arable, the government also built dams and pumped groundwater to irrigate land, expanding irrigated areas significantly from 8,000 to 22,662 square kilometers between 1968 and 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Iran has continued this trend, becoming one of the world's biggest dam-building countries with over 588 dams and 100 more under construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

### Consequences of Groundwater Overextraction
Even in the 1960s, Iranians began to experience the problems of [[groundwater_overextraction_and_its_consequences_in_iran | groundwater overextraction]], with parliament passing laws in 1966 to ban drilling and over-pumping due to dropping water tables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

Today, groundwater is Iran's primary water source, accounting for 55% of the total supply in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. A 2021 study estimated that over 74 cubic kilometers of water were extracted from 2002 to 2015 alone, equivalent to the world's 34th largest freshwater lake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Despite regulations, there is little enforcement, leading to a massive increase in wells from 47,000 in 1979 to 789,000 in 2013, most of which are illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

As [[groundwater_overextraction_and_its_consequences_in_iran | groundwater overextraction]] continues, the water table declines, forcing people to drill deeper, especially during serious droughts which are projected to intensify with [[impact_of_geography_and_weather_on_reservoir_silting | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

The consequences are severe:
*   **Increased Salinity** The soil and groundwater become saltier, with some areas like the Karkheh Basin (a major agricultural area) seeing 85% higher electrical conductivity measurements (salinity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Land Subsidence** Declining groundwater levels cause the ground to literally sink, a phenomenon known as subsidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Iran's land is shrinking by an average of six centimeters a year, with some areas experiencing a staggering 19 centimeters annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. This sinking ground damages infrastructure like transmission lines, bridges, and buildings, and undermines structural safety during potential earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Crucially, subsidence also damages the aquifer's capacity to carry water, sometimes permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

### Impact on Major Water Bodies
*   **Lake Urmia** Once the largest lake in Iran and the Middle East, Lake Urmia has aggressively shrunk due to persistent drought and water mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. A massive bridge construction project completed in the early 2000s further exacerbated the issue by cutting the lake in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Today, the lake is only a tenth of its former size, and its dry lake bed causes huge salt storms that ruin nearby farms by depositing salt over the soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Hamoun Lake** Located on the border with Afghanistan, Hamoun Lake is Eastern Iran's largest body of fresh water and has been home to people for 5,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. Although seasonal, shrinking and growing with spring rains, it vanished entirely during a severe drought in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. The dry lake bed subsequently caused large dust storms, posing a serious health hazard and leading to the evacuation of 124 surrounding villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

## Outlook
While Iran's large population contributes to the water problem, the core issue remains one of demand and [[challenges_and_reforms_needed_in_irans_water_management_system | mismanagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. Difficult decisions regarding water usage in homes, industry, and especially agriculture, are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. The long-term costs of current water mismanagement are heavy, and fundamental reforms are required to address this challenge amidst an increasingly turbulent climate change and political situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

South Korea's economic strength is intricately linked to its major business groups, known as *chaebol*, such as Samsung, Hyundai, and LG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While these groups power the nation's export economy and dominate daily life, they have also been accused of manipulating the Korean economy to their advantage and maintaining corrupt ties with high levels of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This long-standing issue has shaped South Korea's [[evolution_of_south_koreas_political_and_economic_landscape | political and economic landscape]].

## Roots of Corruption and Inequality

Corruption in Korea predates the modern state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The Japanese colonial state's agricultural economy was marked by corruption and inequality, with large landlords exploiting farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. After World War II, many of these legacies passed to the new South Korean government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### The Syngman Rhee Era and the Birth of Chaebol

South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee, a staunch anti-communist, sought to raise funds for the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Beginning in 1946 and peaking in the 1950s, his government privatized assets seized from the Japanese state and other state-owned entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The prices for these privatizations were determined by private negotiation rather than public auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, leading to incredibly favorable deals for purchasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Companies like Tongyang Beers (now Oriental Brewery), De Haan Textile, and Tongyang Cement became part of the Tongyang Group through this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. These purchasers eventually formed the *chaebol*, akin to Japan's *zaibatsu* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Park Chung-hee and the Crony Capitalism Deal

In 1961, Park Chung-hee led a military coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Immediately after, he arrested *chaebol* heads for corrupt wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. However, his government quickly negotiated a [[crony_capitalism_and_its_role_in_building_indonesias_largest_business_empire | crony capitalism]] deal with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Park sought to emulate Japan's industrialization and needed the *chaebol*'s help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Under this agreement:
*   The *chaebol* supported Park's policies for import substitution and later exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   The Korean government provided *chaebol* with foreign currency loans at below-market interest rates to acquire foreign technologies and build capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   The *chaebol* contributed funds (10-15% loan commissions or kickbacks) for Park's presidential campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

This system incentivized companies to build close ties with the president to acquire cheap capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Park Chung-hee notably maintained close personal ties with Chung Ju-yung of Hyundai and Kim Woo-joong of [[rise_and_fall_of_daewoo_group | Daewoo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Kickbacks escalated, with the top five *chaebol* contributing over 800 million won annually before 1972, growing to 1.5 billion won after 1972 (adjusted to 1990 prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

For two decades, the government and *chaebol* dominated Korean society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Companies funded political campaigns and contributed to economic growth, while the government granted privileges and imposed the costs of *chaebol* excesses onto society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For example, in 1971, when *chaebol* were over-leveraged, the government converted their private market loans to five-year public ones and froze private interest rates, effectively hurting small lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Shifting Power and Growing Discontent

As Korea entered the 1980s, the military dictatorship's grip weakened, and the balance of power began to shift towards the *chaebol* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. By the mid-1980s, the top five *chaebol* accounted for nearly 20% of the country's GDP and 45% of its mining/manufacturing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The *chaebol*-centric strategy stifled the small and medium-sized business sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

This imbalance led to public disapproval of the *chaebol*'s outsized power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. As Koreans became richer, they demanded more than just higher wages; they sought better environmental regulations, working conditions, and an improved quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The increasingly democratic government was compelled to shift from support to regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Despite this, political leaders, including Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, continued to rely on *chaebol* financial contributions to stay in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. *Chaebol* contributed billions of won to high-level political campaigns during these administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This corrupt relationship persisted due to the weakness of Korea's political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. After decades of military dictatorship, there was no time to build suitable political campaigning norms, leaving parties vulnerable to corruption and dependent on *chaebol* for cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This allowed *chaebol* to secure government aid, plentiful capital, favorable regulations, and protection from competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## The Asian Financial Crisis and Its Aftermath

The [[impact_of_financial_crises_on_South_Korean_business_practices | Asian Financial Crisis]] of 1997 exposed the consequences of Korea's inability to rein in its big businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. In the decade following democratization in 1987, *chaebol* gained significant political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. For example, in 1988, [[rise_and_fall_of_daewoo_group | Daewoo Group]] influenced the National Assembly to amend a law to bail out its ailing shipbuilding corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

*Chaebol* also pushed for rapid liberalization reforms that aided their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>:
*   **Easier Access to Foreign Capital**: Allowed *chaebol* to take out cheap loans denominated in foreign currencies, leading to a massive debt boom that contributed to the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Ownership in Non-Bank Financial Companies**: Enabled *chaebol* to take limited ownership stakes, fostering complex cross-ownership structures that obscured their true size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. For instance, the Lee family, controlling Samsung Group, exercised operating control over almost all affiliated companies with only a minority share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

This complexity meant that it was unclear which subsidiaries were profitable and which were losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Profitable companies often propped up weaker ones, causing market inefficiencies and oversupply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

The 1997 crisis significantly reduced the *chaebol*'s power, opening the door for reforms aimed at preventing future financial crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun administrations imposed reforms to limit debt capacity and cross-shareholder structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Examples include Hanjin Shipping being forced to reduce its debt to equity ratio below 200% by selling ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, and the consolidation of the Korean car industry from five independent companies to just Hyundai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. *Chaebol* also reduced their affiliates and increased dividends to minority shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

The crisis also catalyzed the Korean export juggernaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Recognizing an unfriendly domestic environment, the biggest *chaebol* leveraged free trade agreements in the 2000s and focused on international markets, achieving massive success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. By 2013, 86% of Samsung's revenue came from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This success drove Korea's top-line economic recovery, with an average growth rate of 5% from 1998 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## Persistent Inequality and Recent Efforts

Despite economic growth, the benefits of this recovery were concentrated among a small group, leading to a significant gap between the "haves" and "have-nots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. In 2013, while *chaebol* brought in over 50% of revenue and value add in manufacturing, they employed less than 20% of the sector's employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

As part of the post-1997 reforms, the government allowed *chaebol* to lay off workers more easily to service their debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Hundreds of thousands lost their jobs, many struggling to find regular salaried work since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Elder poverty in Korea subsequently reached four times the OECD average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, and the income share of the top 1% of Korean society rose from 7% before 1997 to 12% in the mid-2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The Korean populace recognized this [[social_inequality_and_economic_reforms_in_south_korea | inequality]] and the disconnect from the success of the "national champions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

In 2007, President Lee Myung-bak, a former Hyundai Construction CEO, campaigned on economic recovery, promising to boost GDP growth to 7% and make Korea the seventh-largest economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. He won, but low voter participation indicated a loss of faith in the government's ability to curb social inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Lee's policies aimed to unleash *chaebol* to compete globally, lowering corporate tax rates, raising non-bank financial investment ceilings, and pardoning convicted executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. However, his administration failed to deliver the promised growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Lee himself was later arrested for bribery, embezzlement, and tax fraud in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## Modern Corruption and Its Consequences

Modern corruption by *chaebol* primarily focuses on maximizing wealth and market power, often through tax manipulations and legislative/regulatory capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. These actions have tangible consequences, as tragically demonstrated by the 2014 Sewol sinking, which claimed 304 lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. The high death rate was attributed to ignored safety and rescue regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. The regulatory agency and the ferry company had worked closely to ignore violations, maintaining a profitable status quo that included revolving door employment between government and industry, and the ferry company's monopoly on a lucrative route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

South Korea's struggle with its largest companies persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. President Park Geun-hye's administration ended in corruption scandals and impeachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Her successor, Moon Jae-in, implemented business reforms and higher tax rates, leading to some improvement in public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

Despite efforts, the South Korean economy remains highly dependent on its handful of powerful global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Substantial reform could weaken their global market position against competitors from the United States, Europe, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. *Chaebol* reform and how to address it continue to be fiercely debated issues in South Korean presidential politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

From 1960 to 1973, the Soviet Union launched 15 probes and orbiters to Mars, locked in competition with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The Soviets struggled to match NASA's incredibly successful Martian program, losing the race to fly by Mars, orbit Mars, and safely land on and clearly photograph the Martian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While the Soviets "won Venus," they "lost Mars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Early Space Race and Sputnik
In 1950, Joseph Stalin sought a missile capable of hitting Western enemies, turning to Sergey Korolev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Korolev, who started with gliders before moving into rockets, was uniquely positioned to reverse-engineer German V2 rocket designs during the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. He eventually delivered the R7 missile, successfully fired in 1957 after Stalin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Stalin's passing loosened the political climate, allowing Korolev to pursue his dream of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. He told his young engineers that the rocket's purpose was to reach the Moon, Venus, and Mars, not merely be a "military toy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

In January 1956, the Public Bureau permitted the development of "object D," an artificial satellite now known as Sputnik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. After three failed launches, Sputnik was successfully put into orbit on October 4, 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The Soviet Union was surprised by the international reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Soviet media regularly reported on space progress, but few in the West seemed to believe it until Sputnik was overhead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The New York Times used headline font sizes not seen since Pearl Harbor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. American political elites pondered their failure and sought to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Martian Ambitions
After Sputnik's launch, Korolev and his team proposed a vast new program to the Central Committee in July 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This program aimed to send robot spacecraft to Mars and Venus using an upgraded R7 rocket, followed by a four-stage R7 rocket for crewed missions to the Moon, Venus, and Mars, with the final step being the establishment of colonies on these planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

While the Soviet space program spent most resources on lunar probes in 1958-1959, their real targets were the planets, with Mars being the "real prize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The launch window for Mars occurred roughly every 25 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The initial 1958 target slipped to 1960, a decision influenced by the US pushing back their Mariner 2 Venus probe launch to 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Challenges of Interplanetary Travel
Interplanetary travel, requiring probes to fly over 100 million miles and a seven-month journey within the orbital window, demanded higher speeds (11 kilometers per second) compared to Earth orbit (7 kilometers per second), necessitating additional rocket stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Safe launch was not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

In January 1960, Nikita Khrushchev, concerned about the growing American space program, pressed Korolev for launches to Mars and Venus within the 1960 window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. A month later, Korolev drafted Project 1M, a plan for Mars scheduled for September 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This required a new, more powerful four-stage R7 rocket, the 8K78 Molniya, which only existed on paper in February 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Korolev's team had to build this fourth stage from scratch and rushed production for the Autumn launch date, resulting in a "dumpster fire" of issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

> [!WARNING] First Mars Missions (1960)
> *   The first Molniya rocket, launched October 10, 1960, broke up over Eastern Siberia due to heavy vibrations during its second stage burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
> *   The second probe's third stage failed to trigger due to a frozen kerosene leak, causing it to break up in the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
> *   Both 1M launches failed before even attempting to use their newly built fourth stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

> [!INFO] Nedelin Catastrophe (1960)
> A prototype R-16 missile launch went wrong, with a short circuit causing second stage engines to fire, detonating first stage tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This explosion incinerated an unknown number of technicians and killed the missile's designer, M.I. Nedelin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Soviet 2MV Probes (1961-1962)
Following initial failures, Korolev's team launched two Venus probes, the 1Ves, similar to the 1M Mars probes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Venera 1, launched February 12, 1961, became humanity's first true interplanetary spacecraft, though it sent no data back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Korolev then plunged into the 2MV project, aiming for Landers and flyby probes for Venus and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Soviet scientists struggled to make the Molniya rocket reliable due to manufacturing issues in its lower stages and challenges with igniting the critical fourth stage in zero gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The Americans also faced rocket challenges; between February 1961 and September 1962, seven straight probes, including two American ones, failed to reach Venus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

The Soviet program built six 2MV probes, three for the 1962 Mars launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Cuban Missile Crisis and Sputnik 22 (1962)
> Sputnik 22 (2MV-4 #1) launched on October 24, 1962, amidst the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Due to the national emergency, the Baikonur Cosmodrome, with only two launch pads, needed to prioritize ICBMs over civilian rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. The launch went ahead after the crisis but the probe failed in Earth orbit due to an issue with the fourth stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. A US warning station initially picked up the rocket's debris as nuclear missiles, but this was quickly dismissed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

Mars 1 (originally 2MV #4 or Sputnik 23) launched on November 1, 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. It experienced a gas engine leak in its orientation system, leading to loss of contact on March 21, 1963, a few months before its arrival at Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Despite the loss, it earned the name Mars 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

### Zond Series and Mariner 4 (1964-1965)
The Soviets tried new improvements with their Zond series, but these probes were also troublesome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Zond 2, intended for Mars and launched November 1964, suffered fatal onboard failures, including a failed solar panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

This failure was worsened by the US success with Mariner 4, which launched around the same time as Zond 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Mariner 4 flew by Mars in July 1965, sending back 22 photographs covering about one percent of the Martian surface, revealing a cold, dead world like the Moon, with no canals, no magnetic field, and a very thin atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. This drastically downgraded dreams of sophisticated Martian life and dampened enthusiasm for future Mars missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

## Focus Shift to the Moon
The Soviets realized the Americans were serious about a crewed Moon landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. In August 1964, the Politburo directed Korolev to do the same, entering direct competition with the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. This "race to the moon" threw the Soviet space program's plans into managerial chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]岡田, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Korolev's primary goal became sending a man to the Moon, so in March 1965, robot missions to the Moon and planets were reassigned to a new firm, Lavochkin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Korolev passed away in January 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

### M69 Project (1969)
Mariner 4's success led the Lavochkin team to conclude that the first generation of Mars craft had fundamental flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. They decided simply replicating Mariner 4 would not suffice; they aimed to surpass the Americans by soft-landing a probe to search for microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

In October 1965, the Soviet program leadership decided to reboot the entire program, which meant missing the next Mars launch window in October 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. With the Americans pushing forward with more flybys, orbiters, and Landers in the early 1970s, the Soviets needed something in space by 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. The new project was called M69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

The M69 probes ditched old designs and gained a boost from the new UR-500 (Proton) rocket, developed as a super-large ICBM, allowing them to send 4-5 metric tons on an interplanetary trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. However, the M69 suffered from weight issues, ballooning to 4850 kg, mainly due to fuel and the inability to shrink instruments without advanced semiconductor technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

> [!WARNING] M69 Failures (1969)
> *   The first M69 probe (M69a), launched March 27, 1969, exploded 438 seconds into launch due to a rotor failure in a pump inside the rocket's third stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

> *   The second probe (M69b), launched April 2, 1969, also failed due to a rocket failure, with the right engine on its first stage failing at launch, causing it to fall back and explode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

The "mass of [[political_influences_on_the_soviet_space_program | political pressure]]" levied by the Soviet leadership on the program had "come back to haunt them," marking "yet another failure in the Soviet missions to Mars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. This defeat was made even more bitter when the Americans triumphantly landed on the Moon with Apollo 11 in July 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. NASA followed this a week later with Mariner 6 and 7, which flew over Mars's South Pole and equator, took hundreds of photos, and studied its atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

### M71 Project (1971)
The M69's failure meant Soviet engineers lacked atmospheric data for a soft landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. The 1971 launch window was a special year, occurring every 15-17 years when Earth and Mars are very close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. The Soviet program managers decided to send three probes: one Orbiter (Mars 71s) to gather atmospheric data, and two Landers (M71p) to use that data for a soft landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>.

> *   Mars 3 arrived on December 2, 1971, and its optical navigation system executed correctly, with the landing sequence going as planned amidst the Mars storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. However, 14.5 seconds after starting, the television camera system failed, sending only 79 lines of a single photograph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

Despite the entry probe failures, Mars 2 and 3 continued to orbit and conduct science, but their findings were overshadowed by Mariner 9's stunning success, which took 7,329 photographs covering 85 percent of the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.

## Détente and Data Swap
The Americans, buoyed by Mariner 9, announced two new probes, Viking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. During this period of Détente in the Cold War, leaders Nixon and Brezhnev agreed on joint missions in science, biology, medicine, and planetary exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. A key achievement of this collaboration was the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>.

As part of these agreements, the Soviets provided the Americans with data from their Mars 2, Mars 3, and Venera 8 missions, and in return, the Americans gave the Soviets the atmospheric data they lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.

## Final Mars Attempts (1973)
Despite the data swap, the race was still on, with the Soviets knowing Viking was launching in 1975 with sophisticated systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. The Soviet leadership planned an "all-out assault on Mars" in the 1973 launch window to try and beat the Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:53">[00:34:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>. This involved two orbiters (Mars 4 and 5) and two Landers (Mars 6 and 7), which largely adopted designs from the earlier M71 devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

All four spacecraft launched in the summer of 1973 without incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. However, tests uncovered repeated failures in the Power Systems due to fundamental faults in the 2T312 transistors, which had aluminum leads instead of the specified gold leads, leading to corrosion and failure at high rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>. Engineers estimated a 50/50 chance of catastrophic failure, but the ministry decided to proceed due to political pressure and the looming Viking mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.

## Conclusion
The Soviet leadership viewed the 1973 Mars "assault" as a failure, dismissing the program's chief designer and pivoting the Soviet space program toward a space shuttle (Buran) and its launcher (Energia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>. Consequently, fewer resources were allocated to the Soviet planetary space program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>. Leadership pragmatically decided to concentrate on Venus, where they had a clear advantage, for the next 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>.

The Soviet Mars program was defined by its competition with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>. This competition granted them substantial resources due to the program's political importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. However, arduous political requirements, limited launch windows, poor execution, and bad luck foiled Soviet success on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>. Their achievements were far eclipsed by those of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>. Nevertheless, the Soviet Mars program's efforts to send 15 robots millions of kilometers to another planet were truly incredible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:38">[00:42:38]</a>.

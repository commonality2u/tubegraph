Europe's current role as a minor producer and consumer of semiconductors is a result of a complex history, marked significantly by the differing approaches of governments and the varying demands of military and consumer markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

### Early European Potential and Squandered Lead
Europe, particularly France, was an early research pioneer in semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Europeans independently invented the first transistor just months after the Americans in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, with French scientists Herbert Matera and Heinrich Welker developing a "point contact transistor" conceptually similar to Bell Labs' invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. By 1949, France had impressive semiconductor achievements, including the Transistron, which was lauded as superior to its American counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. A factory was even built in France capable of producing tens of thousands of Transistrons monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

However, this early lead was quickly squandered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The French government, with concerns about nuclear technology, decided to focus its resources on developing nuclear capabilities, leaving the telecommunications industry (and thus semiconductor work) to the private sector without government funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This led to work on the Transistron languishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

A lack of joint business-government initiatives also hindered the transition of theoretical breakthroughs to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. French physicist Pierre Aigrain, an unofficial patron of semiconductor research, focused on theoretical space, and French businesses largely underinvested in R&D, preferring outdated vacuum tube technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. An austerity policy implemented by French Finance Minister Antoine Pinay in 1957-1958, partly due to the Algerian War, further crippled the French transistor industry, which was 90% dependent on government funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This led to reliance on imports, shrinking margins, and impeded future investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### The Defining Role of US Military Demand (1960s)
The American semiconductor industry, by contrast, thrived due to specific factors, including government influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Bell Labs liberally granted licenses for its transistor technology, partly due to anti-trust concerns but also believing in spreading the knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

Crucially, the military played a critical role in shaping the direction of the American semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. By the 1960s, the military purchased half of the semiconductor industry's total output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Projects like the Minuteman II ICBM (starting in 1962) and the Apollo program (1961-1965) drove significant demand for integrated circuits (ICs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This demand forced American firms to develop devices that were smaller, used less power, and were highly reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This focus on performance over price, rather than just cheaper devices, honed advanced techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

In stark contrast, Europe's semiconductor demand in the 1960s came predominantly from the consumer sector, which prioritized price over performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. For example, the military made up 50% of the U.S. semiconductor market in 1960, but only 29% in France and 8% in West Germany and Italy in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. European electronics giants like Philips and Siemens focused on evolutionary improvements to their existing, cheaper transistor technologies (like germanium alloy transistors) rather than disruptive, higher-performing silicon-based ICs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

The French government also shifted its focus to computers. In 1961, it launched a plan to support its domestic calculator and computer industries, which turned against the nascent semiconductor industry, deeming French semiconductors uncompetitive in quantity or quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. In 1966, France launched "Plan Calcul" in response to IBM's dominance and U.S. export policies, prioritizing a national computer as quickly as possible, pushing the domestic French semiconductor industry to the "back burner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

### Shifting Sands: The 1970s and Beyond
The 1970s brought increasing complexity with the introduction of microprocessors and large-scale integration (LSI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Any new entrant would require significant resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. Europe's flaws now included not only lacking the production capabilities for LSI devices but also lacking a strong source of demand for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Europe's computer companies were much smaller than American ones, and its military/avionics demand was weak, tending to favor established firms over disruptive technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.

Japan, initially lagging, demonstrated how strategic government intervention could enable catch-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. The Japanese government encouraged radio and television adoption throughout the 1950s and 1960s and gated imports to allow its domestic industry to build competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Alarmed by IBM's dominance, the Japanese leadership launched the very large-scale integration (VLSI) project in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. This project, budgeted hundreds of millions of dollars, aimed to unite computer makers to cooperatively develop next-generation VLSI technology, ultimately helping Japanese semiconductor makers hone techniques for putting tens of thousands of transistors on a single chip, giving them a generational lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

In West Germany, industrial policy was more market-oriented and decentralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Although the West German government recognized microelectronics as important and budgeted $1.4 billion from 1974 to 1979 to advance its domestic semiconductor industry, this money was funneled through large, conservative electronics firms like Siemens and AEG, which continued to lag behind American companies by a decade or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

By the 1980s, European policymakers began to shift their approach, moving away from solely supporting national champions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

*   **France**: In 1982, President Francois Mitterrand unveiled a five-year microelectronics plan, pledging 4.5 billion francs annually for chip R&D, industry-university connections, and subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. However, these subsidies, while driving investment, "paled compared to the economic might of the Americans and Japanese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.
*   **West Germany**: In 1984, the government launched a significant semiconductor R&D program, allocating a billion Deutsche Marks over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. A prominent initiative was the "Mega project," a joint effort with the Dutch government to help Siemens and Philips develop advanced DRAM and SRAM chips by 1988, dubbed "Europe's last chance against the Japanese chip Invasion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. While Siemens delivered its 4-megabit chip in 1987, it relied on licensed Toshiba technology, and Japan was already three years ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
*   **Pan-European Efforts**: The Mega project evolved into the Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative (JESSI) in 1989, a â‚¬4 billion pan-European research project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. Despite its ambitions, JESSI faced issues, including Phillips exiting memory production and Siemens abandoning its 16-megabit memory plans to ally with IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. Other countries like Belgium also had projects, leading to the founding of IMEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. By the 1980s, policy goal-setting shifted to the European Community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.

Despite these efforts, Europe's share of world semiconductor production plummeted from 60% in 1979 to 10% in 1991, with European companies holding less than 30% of their own market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

### Conclusion
Europe's semiconductor lag is not due to a single reason, but a compounding of factors over half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. While the U.S. and Europe discovered transistor technology at roughly the same time, Europe fell behind in the 1950s due to political, technological, and production issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>. The consistent and substantial **military demand in the US** drove technological progress and competence, fostering disruptive startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. In the 1970s, Europe's policy focused on computers, disregarding semiconductors, a mistake Japan did not make with its **government-backed VLSI project** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. Despite **significant R&D success and government funding** in the 1980s and 1990s, the rise of Asian supply chains and intensified market competition relegated European manufacturers to specialty markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

Today, the EU's plan to double its share in high-end chip fabrication to 20% via the [[Impact of Chips Act on US semiconductor industry | EU Chips Act]] aims to reverse a 30-year stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. History shows that European governments have always been willing to financially support their semiconductor industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>; the question remains whether this time will be different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

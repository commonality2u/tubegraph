In 2024, [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | lithium-ion battery pack prices]] experienced a significant 20% drop, reaching $115 per kilowatt-hour, marking the largest price reduction since 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This decline has made Chinese batteries more economical, even when considering tariffs of 25%, 35%, or potentially 120% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. At the core of this trend are advancements in the [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP)]] battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Once considered a low-end option with fundamental chemistry weaknesses, LFP batteries have seen significant engineering improvements, largely driven by [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Battery Chemistries: LFP vs. Ternary

Lithium-ion batteries consist of two electrodes: the cathode and the anode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The anode is typically graphite, making the cathode the most expensive component, accounting for over 70% of the battery's value and defining its type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The industry primarily utilizes three major chemistries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>:

1.  **Ternary Batteries:** These batteries have cathodes that blend three materials:
    *   Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
    *   Nickel Cobalt Aluminum (NCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
    *   **Advantages:** Higher energy densities, allowing for more energy storage in a smaller, lighter package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This translates to potentially longer ranges for electric vehicles (EVs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Their energy density ranges from 230-260 watt-hours per kilogram for NCA and 250-320 watt-hours per kilogram for NMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Utilize rarer and more expensive materials like nickel and cobalt, which constitute about 70% of the battery's raw material cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Their higher energy densities also increase thermal risks, potentially leading to thermal runaway (fire) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

2.  **LFP Batteries:** These use a dual-chemistry cathode made from iron phosphate, notably lacking cobalt or nickel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   **Advantages:** Substantial cost advantage due to the abundance of iron and phosphorus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. They also maintain their initial energy capacity better over numerous charge and discharge cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Lower energy density inherently reduces the risks of thermal runaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Historically suffered from lower energy densities, typically 90 to 160 watt-hours per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This means LFP-powered EVs traditionally had shorter ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

In essence, LFP batteries excel in cost and safety but historically lagged in performance, while NMC and NCA offered performance at higher costs and greater safety risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Evolution and the Rise of LFP in China

Early lithium-ion batteries were Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCOs), which heavily relied on cobalt, primarily sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The unsustainable nature of this reliance, both economically and ethically, led to the adoption of ternary chemistries like NCA, NMC, and Lithium Manganese Oxide (LMO), which used significantly less cobalt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Western EVs of the 2010s, such as the Chevrolet Volt and Tesla Model S, predominantly used ternary batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Concurrently, [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | China's]] nascent EV industry, including early [[the_rise_of_ev_companies_in_china | EV companies]] like BYD, embraced LFPs for their "new energy vehicles," especially buses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This was influenced by government policies like the 2009 "Thousands of Vehicles, Tens of Cities" (TVTC) policy, which subsidized municipal governments to purchase public service fleets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This early adoption led to LFP chemistries dominating the Chinese EV market for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

However, starting in late 2016, the Chinese government shifted its subsidy policies to incentivize cars more appealing to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Subsidies became linked to factors like higher energy density and longer driving ranges, favoring ternary batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This policy change caused LFP's market share to fall to as low as 30% by mid-2019, with even LFP proponents like BYD adopting ternary chemistries for some models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### The LFP Resurgence

Two key developments reversed this trend and revitalized LFP batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>:

#### 1. Subsidy Withdrawal

In June 2019, [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | China's]] government began to withdraw EV cash subsidies, surprising the industry with a 50% reduction almost immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This aggressive sunsetting leveled the cost playing field, prompting EV makers to switch back to more cost-effective LFP batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

#### 2. Technological Innovation: The Blade Battery

Concurrent with subsidy changes, LFP manufacturers introduced new technologies to overcome their inherent weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. BYD's "Blade" battery, introduced in March 2020, revolutionized EV battery manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

Traditionally, EV batteries are structured in three levels: cells, modules, and packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The Blade battery employed a "Cell-to-Pack" (CTP) design, entirely skipping the module level and inserting long, ultra-thin prismatic cells directly into the battery pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This maximized the pack's volume, compensating for LFP's lower energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

The Blade battery was a "game-changer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The 2020 BYD Han EV, using LFP Blade batteries, achieved a range of 605 kilometers (NEDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, comparable to premium ternary-powered EVs like the Model 3 and Xpeng P7, but at a significantly lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. CTP technology allows LFP battery packs to reach about 85% of the energy density of conventional NMC batteries, while ternary batteries struggle to adopt CTP due to higher operating temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Other major Chinese battery makers, such as CATL, soon adopted CTP technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

As a result, LFP battery volumes surpassed NMC in 2021, accounting for nearly 70% of EV installations by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. NMC batteries are now primarily reserved for premium, high-performance vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

#### 3. [[the_influence_of_patents_on_lfp_battery_development | Patent]](s) Expiry

The fundamental [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | LFP cathode]] was pioneered and patented by Dr. John Goodenough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. However, his initial LFP invention faced commercial performance issues, particularly poor electrical conductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Key innovations in carbon coating and process technologies, patented by researchers in Canada and Europe, made LFP commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

A deal in the 2000s or 2010s allowed Chinese battery makers to use these LFP battery patents for free within their local markets, while others had to pay licensing fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This "patent shield" enabled [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | China]] to develop immense proficiency in LFP technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. When these patents expired in 2022, foreign manufacturers could access the chemistry freely, but China had already established a massive lead in supply chain proficiency, CTP innovations, economies of scale, and talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

### Competition and Innovation

In 2021, BYD, which previously only supplied batteries for its own cars, began selling its Blade batteries to third-party automakers like Toyota and Ford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. This introduced a major new Tier 1 battery supplier, intensifying competition and triggering a price war in an already fierce Chinese EV market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

This intense competition is driving further innovation in LFP, including:
*   **Lithium Manganese Iron Phosphate (LMFP):** Adding manganese to LFP to achieve higher energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **"Double firing" (二烧) process:** A two-step firing process for cathode precursors that results in more uniform particles and better, more consistent performance for long-range, fast-charging EVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

### Raw Material Costs

A significant contributor to the [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | lithium-ion battery price crash]] after 2022 was a concurrent fall in raw material prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. Raw materials account for 70-80% of a battery cell's cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. For LFP, iron phosphate and lithium alone make up 80% of the material cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

The lithium market saw a rapid reversal from a shortage in 2022 to a glut in 2023, as new sources came online in Australia, Chile, and Argentina, causing prices to crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Similarly, iron ore prices fell 15% in 2024 due to [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | China's]] real estate crisis, which reduced crude steel production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. These falling raw material costs allow Chinese EV battery makers to reduce battery prices while maintaining profitability, as seen with CATL's rising gross profit margins despite revenue decline in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

## Impact on Utility-Scale Energy Storage

The falling [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | prices of LFP batteries]] have had significant ripple effects beyond EVs, particularly in utility-scale stationary energy storage systems, known as Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. BESS are crucial for storing power generated by intermittent sources like wind or solar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

LFP batteries were already favored for BESS due to their lower material costs and resistance to thermal runaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. The Chinese EV boom after 2021 further accelerated the adoption of BESS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. While BESS may not yet match the sheer capacity or duration of pumped storage (e.g., 1-2 hours compared to 4-12 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>, they are "incredibly cheap" and easy to deploy, often housed in standard-sized containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.

Despite legitimate fire concerns, vendors are improving control measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Billions of dollars are being invested in BESS projects across the United States, particularly in California and Texas, with $11.45 billion in the first half of 2024 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

## Conclusion and Future Outlook

The Chinese EV and stationary battery industries continue to advance, with market analysts predicting continued, though slower, declines in [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | LFP prices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

An interesting future development to monitor is [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development | sodium-ion battery]] technology, which CATL, BYD, and Huawei are actively pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. While [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development | sodium-ion]] batteries currently have fundamental energy density shortcomings compared to lithium-ion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>, sodium is far more accessible than lithium, appears to charge faster, and its energy density numbers are improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. Given the highly optimized LFP supply chain, the overall [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | impact of sodium-ion]] technology remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

Throughout its history, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant generational shifts in technology, which have dramatically altered market leadership and company fortunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. These shifts represent periods when the "ground underneath the industry shifted," leading to former winners becoming losers and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

## Historical Context

In the mid-1990s, Japanese companies Nikon and Canon dominated the photolithography space, together holding a three-quarter market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This dominance followed an earlier shift in the 1980s when they overthrew American leaders like Perkin-Elmer and Geophysics Corporation of America (GCA) by offering superior performance at a low price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

However, a Dutch company, ASML, rose to overtake Nikon and Canon, eventually becoming Europe's most valuable technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Nikon and Canon are no longer competing at the cutting edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This shift in power was largely due to three major industry generational events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Key Generational Shifts and Their Impact

### 1. Twinscan System

In 2001, ASML introduced its first Twinscan system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This system processes wafers in two stages: a measurement stage and an exposure stage, allowing it to process significantly more wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This dual-wielding approach, while complex, was a significant [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | technological advancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

*   **Impact on ASML**: ASML rapidly iterated on its success, achieving 50% market share of lithography tools by 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Impact on Nikon and Canon**: They could not replicate the Twinscan technology fast enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This was partly due to their weakness in software development compared to ASML's sophisticated, abstract-level software practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

### 2. Immersion Lithography

The second breakthrough was a generational shift to immersion lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Unlike previous techniques with an air gap between the wafer and the stepper, immersion lithography replaces this air gap with water, allowing ultraviolet light to be shot through water onto the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Although the technique was known, it was largely ignored by the industry until a Taiwanese scientist, Bern Lin, demonstrated its viability for reaching a 45 nanometer process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

*   **Impact on ASML**: ASML managed to commercialize immersion lithography first in 2003 with the Twinscan AT1150i, and its volume immersion product, the Twinscan XT1700i, released three years later, cemented its dominant position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This success was aided by strong industry-academia ties in the West, which were weaker in Japan, hindering their ability to leverage external research for practical commercial systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   **Impact on Nikon and Canon**: Their slower adoption and commercialization of immersion lithography contributed to their decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### 3. Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography

The semiconductor industry knew that immersion lithography was a stop-gap measure and debated multiple next-generation options, eventually choosing Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) as the next solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

*   **Impact on ASML**: Major chipmakers banded together to support ASML in commercializing EUV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Even with this help, practical EUV systems came a decade late and significantly over budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. ASML's collaborative nature, evident in its joint publications with chipmakers, tool makers, and chemical makers, was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Impact on Nikon and Canon**: Canon "never had a chance" with EUV, and Nikon largely ceased progress after 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This cemented a "massive technical gap" between ASML and its Japanese competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Japanese companies, unlike ASML, lacked a strong collaborative body similar to IMEC, which facilitates cross-industry collaboration and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Contributing Factors to Differential Impact

Several factors explain why these generational shifts had such a differential impact on ASML versus Nikon and Canon:

*   **Software Competence**: ASML's machines became incredibly complex, requiring sophisticated software. ASML was an early adopter of Unified Modeling Language (UML) to visualize and develop software modules at an abstract level, which was critical to their shipping success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. In contrast, Canon and Nikon were not strong in software and adopted these practices relatively recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Industry Collaboration**: ASML's strong ties to research centers like IMEC and its willingness to collaborate extensively with chipmakers, tool makers, and chemical makers allowed it to adapt and innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Canon and Nikon lacked a similar collaborative body and typically did not engage in proactive information exchange with partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Focus Beyond Optics**: While Canon and Nikon historically focused on optics, ASML, by outsourcing optics R&D to Zeiss, was able to look beyond mere optics and find new optimization opportunities, such as the two-stage wafer swap process for the Twinscan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Decline of Japanese Semiconductor Industry**: The decline of the Japanese semiconductor industry, driven by political issues related to trade and the appreciation of the yen in the 1990s, also significantly impacted Nikon and Canon's core market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Conclusion

The story of ASML's rise and the decline of Nikon and Canon illustrates the critical [[impact of generational shifts in the semiconductor industry | importance of adaptability]] and strategic focus during periods of [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | technological advancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. The lesson for companies is to "pay close attention to times of generational shifts" when the underlying technological landscape changes, as this is when market leaders can be overthrown and new champions emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

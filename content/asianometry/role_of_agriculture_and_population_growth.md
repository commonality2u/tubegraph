Iran faces a long-running water problem, exacerbated by its historically arid climate and low rainfall. Much of its central lands are uninhabitable without sufficient water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:00:03">[0:00:03]</a>. Over the years, the country developed a sprawling industrial water system to irrigate dry soil and feed a booming population, which is where the current problems originate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:00:14">[0:00:14]</a>.

## Historical Context and Traditional Water Management
Iran experiences very little precipitation, ranking 158th out of 189 countries in annual average precipitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:00:52">[0:00:52]</a>. Seventy-five percent of this precipitation falls on just 25% of the country's area, with 50% occurring in winter and only 4% in summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:00:59">[0:00:59]</a>. Certain central desert areas receive less than 50 millimeters of rainfall annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:01:10">[0:01:10]</a>. Despite bordering the Caspian Sea to the north and the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman to the south, less than 1% of Iran's 1.6 million square kilometers is surface water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:02:04">[0:02:04]</a>.

Around 3,000 years ago, ancient Persians pioneered the "qanat," a sophisticated water supply system resembling an aqueduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:02:30">[0:02:30]</a>. These gently downward-sloping underground tunnels brought snowmelt water from mountains to plains, sometimes extending for tens of kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:02:41">[0:02:41]</a>. Qanats relied purely on gravity, operated automatically, and prevented evaporation by keeping water underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:02:50">[0:02:50]</a>. Knowledge of their construction was passed down through generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:03:07">[0:03:07]</a>. Prudent water management enabled the success of the Achaemenid Empire (550 to 330 BC), the largest known empire of its day, despite lacking a major river <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:03:16">[0:03:16]</a>.

By the 1900s, population water needs began to outgrow the qanats' capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:04:31">[0:04:31]</a>. With little surface water, Iranians turned to hydraulic mega-projects like dams and irrigation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:02">[0:05:02]</a>. Modern water wells, first built in 1915, quickly gained popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:12">[0:05:12]</a>. Drilling a well and using an electrically powered pump was much faster and less labor-intensive than building a qanat, which could take up to 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:18">[0:05:18]</a>. Authorities pushed for these new systems, causing qanats to fall into disrepair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:40">[0:05:40]</a>. By 1950, qanats supplied only 50% of the country's water, down from 75% in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:46">[0:05:46]</a>.

## White Revolution and Agricultural Industrialization
In 1963, Muhammad Reza Pahlavi implemented the "White Revolution," a land reform scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:54">[0:05:54]</a>. At this time, Iran's population was accelerating, growing at about 3% annually, reaching 25.8 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:06:03">[0:06:03]</a>. Rapid urbanization resulted as many people moved to cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:06:11">[0:06:11]</a>. The government aimed to implement new industrial forms of agriculture to feed this growing populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:06:18">[0:06:18]</a>. The land reform intended to transfer 50% of agricultural lands from landlords to peasants, who were to be taught new growing techniques and given tools like fertilizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:06:26">[0:06:26]</a>.

This reform had profound effects on qanats; previously, landlords paid for their maintenance, essentially treating them as a public good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:06:43">[0:06:43]</a>. After the reform, no centralized authority competently took over their upkeep, and many fell into disrepair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:06:53">[0:06:53]</a>. By 2000, less than 10% of Iran's water came from qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:07:06">[0:07:06]</a>.

With only 10.5% of its land arable due to mountains and deserts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:07:21">[0:07:21]</a>, the government built dams and pumped groundwater for irrigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:07:27">[0:07:27]</a>. Nineteen new dam projects were initiated, 14 of which were completed before 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:07:31">[0:07:31]</a>. This industrial water management system allowed Iran to expand irrigated lands from 8,000 square kilometers in 1968 to 22,662 square kilometers in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:07:40">[0:07:40]</a>. However, by 1966, signs of a dropping water table led to laws banning drilling and overpumping, though these reforms were difficult to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:08">[0:08:08]</a>.

## Post-Revolution Population Surge and Agricultural Policy
The Islamic Revolution in 1979 led to a new government and trade restrictions that drove Iran to seek food self-sufficiency, a drive amplified by the eight-year Iran-Iraq War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:07">[0:09:07]</a>. Simultaneously, the revolution ushered in changes encouraging rapid population growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:20">[0:09:20]</a>. Over three decades, Iran's population grew by an average of 1 million people each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:27">[0:09:27]</a>. By the end of 2022, the World Bank estimated Iran's population at 88.5 million, more than four times its 1960 size and double its size from 20 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:34">[0:09:34]</a>. Despite a recent slowdown in birth rates, the population still expands at about 1.2% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:00">[0:10:00]</a>.

To support this growth and maintain self-sufficiency, Iran significantly increased food production. From 1980 to 2010, crop production grew by 175%, including staples like wheat, potatoes, and rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:14">[0:10:14]</a>. Iran aimed for self-sufficiency in wheat by 1999, becoming the 12th largest wheat producer by 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:30">[0:10:30]</a>.

Agriculture accounts for a staggering 93% of all water used in Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:51">[0:10:51]</a>. The government heavily subsidized water and fertilizer costs for farmers and guaranteed food purchase prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:10:59">[0:10:59]</a>. This nearly free water has encouraged inefficient use, with Iran's average irrigation efficiency (the percentage of crop water need versus actual water used) below 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:11:09">[0:11:09]</a>. Over 70% of land is surface irrigated, leading to substantial water loss from evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:11:21">[0:11:21]</a>. This inefficiency has contributed to the agricultural sector's decline in the country's [[natural_resource_dependence_and_economic_challenges|primarily oil-based economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:11:37">[0:11:37]</a>, contributing just 12.4% of GDP in 2021, down from 25.9% in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:11:40">[0:11:40]</a>. Despite these efforts, Iran remains short of complete food self-sufficiency, importing 1.8 million tons of wheat from Russia in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:11:51">[0:11:51]</a>. Reforms to improve farming efficiency face challenges because agriculture still employs 23% of Iran's population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:01">[0:12:01]</a>.

## Decentralized Water Management and Environmental Impacts
Post-Islamic Revolution, Water Resource Management Affairs devolved from a single centralized body to several departments and ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:41">[0:12:41]</a>. Key ministries involved include:
*   **Ministry of Health and Medical Education:** Sets drinking water quality standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:49">[0:12:49]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Energy:** Allocates water for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use, and regulates wastewater and hydropower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:12:56">[0:12:56]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Agriculture Jihad:** Allocates water among farmers, collects water fees, and, historically through the Ministry of Construction Jihad, built [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources|water infrastructure]] like pipes, roads, and water filtration systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:13:08">[0:13:08]</a>.
*   **Department of Environment:** Handles water pollution control, policy preparation, and assesses hydropower and irrigation projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:13:51">[0:13:51]</a>.

This fragmented system prevents an integrated approach to water supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:01">[0:14:01]</a>. In recent decades, the Iranian government has focused on growing water supply rather than cutting demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:07">[0:14:07]</a>. Iran has become one of the world's biggest dam-building countries, with over 588 dams and about 100 more under construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:19">[0:14:19]</a>. While dams provide reservoirs and hydroelectric power, years of water impoundment can damage the environment, often in unique and difficult-to-solve ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:37">[0:14:37]</a>. For example, the Upper Gotvand Dam, completed in 2012, accumulated over 66.5 million tons of salt in its reservoir, raising salinity levels in surrounding soils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:51">[0:14:51]</a>.

To meet rising urban water demand, the government is building high-profile desalination plants on the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:15:08">[0:15:08]</a>. However, transporting this water to central mega-cities is expensive, and it is not economically viable for agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:15:16">[0:15:16]</a>.

Agricultural demand combined with increased development has severely drained the country's surface water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:15:27">[0:15:27]</a>. Lake Urmia, once the biggest lake in Iran and the Middle East, has shrunk aggressively due to drought and water mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:15:35">[0:15:35]</a>. A bridge construction project completed in the early 2000s further exacerbated its decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:15:44">[0:15:44]</a>. Today, the lake is a tenth of its former size, and its dry bed causes huge salt storms that ruin nearby farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:15:56">[0:15:56]</a>. Hamoun Lake, Eastern Iran's largest freshwater body, vanished entirely during a drought in 2001, causing dust storms and forcing the evacuation of 124 surrounding villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:16:08">[0:16:08]</a>.

Groundwater, which became Iran's primary water source after the White Revolution, now accounts for 55% of the total supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:16:42">[0:16:42]</a>. A 2021 study estimated that over 74 cubic kilometers of water were extracted from the ground between 2002 and 2015 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:17:01">[0:17:01]</a>. While drilling wells should be regulated, enforcement is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:17:23">[0:17:23]</a>. The number of wells in Iran grew from 47,000 in 1979 to 789,000 by 2013, with almost all being illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:17:30">[0:17:30]</a>.

As groundwater is withdrawn, the water table declines, forcing deeper drilling, especially during droughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:17:46">[0:17:46]</a>. This leads to saltier soil and groundwater, with some areas like the Karkheh Basin seeing 85% higher salinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:18:05">[0:18:05]</a>. Declining groundwater also causes land subsidence, where the ground literally sinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:18:22">[0:18:22]</a>. Iran's land is shrinking at an average of about six centimeters per year, with some areas reaching 19 centimeters annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:18:28">[0:18:28]</a>. Subsidence damages infrastructure like transmission lines, bridges, and buildings, undermines structural safety, and permanently reduces the aquifer's capacity to carry water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:18:38">[0:18:38]</a>.

While Iran's massive population contributes to the issue, leading to less renewable water per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:01">[0:19:01]</a>, the core of the water crisis lies in demand and mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:08">[0:19:08]</a>. Difficult decisions regarding water usage in homes, industry, and especially farms are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:12">[0:19:12]</a>. Implementing reforms will be challenging for a populist government managing a heavily subsidized economy amidst a turbulent climate and political situation, but long-term reforms are crucial given the heavy costs of current water mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:22">[0:19:22]</a>.

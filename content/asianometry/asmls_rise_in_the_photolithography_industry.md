From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

In the mid-1990s, the photolithography space was dominated by two Japanese companies, Nikon and Canon, which together held a three-quarter share of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A Dutch company, [[overview_of_asml_lithography_machines | ASML]], rose to overtake them, becoming Europe's most valuable technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This article explores how [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] achieved market share and technological leadership, and why its Japanese competitors failed to maintain their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Photolithography Basics

A photolithography stepper or scanner acts as a nanoscale printer that imprints integrated circuit patterns onto a wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A single wafer can contain hundreds of dies, which are the eventual components found in chips like the Apple M1 or A13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The simplified photolithography process involves:
1.  Coating a silicon wafer with a chemical called photoresist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  Using the stepper or scanner to project the integrated circuit design onto the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
3.  Etching away areas not exposed by the baked photoresist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
This process is repeated to achieve the desired level of sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While not the only machine used, the photolithography machine is one of the most critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Historical Context: From US to Japanese Dominance

During the 1960s and 1970s, the United States dominated the photolithography tools market, with Perkin Elmer and Geophysics Corporation of America (GCA) as leading companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This alarmed Japan, prompting its government to reorganize its computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry gathered the country's top optical manufacturers, instructing them to catch up to American leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This initiative became known as the VLSI research project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

By 1980, Nikon introduced its first commercial stepper, quickly followed by Canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. These products offered superior performance at a very low price, allowing the two Japanese companies to overthrow the Americans and dominate the market in less than a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. At this point, Japan's technical lead in lithography tools seemed insurmountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]]'s Foundation and Early Market Penetration

[[ASML]] was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between Dutch firms ASM International and Philips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The semiconductor supplier industry faced immense challenges during this period due to economic fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. [[ASML]] lost money for its first six years, leading ASM to sell its shares to Philips and two banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. In 1990, [[ASML]] was spun out as an independent company but maintained strong ties to Philips, which remained a major shareholder and was located nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Many [[ASML]] employees also worked at Philips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

Along with [[Carl Zeisss partnership with ASML | Carl Zeiss]], these three companies can be seen as practically one block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Philips' backing was crucial, helping [[ASML]] persist and gain a foothold in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. By the time [[ASML]] IPO'd in 1995, it had acquired 25% market share, placing it third, tied with Canon, and behind leader Nikon (45%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## [[Technological advances in lithography tools by ASML | ASML]]'s Breakthroughs and Market Leadership

[[ASML]]'s journey to market leadership was propelled by three major industry generational events:

### Twinscan System
In 2001, [[ASML]] developed and released its first Twinscan system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This system processes wafers in two stages: a measurement stage and an exposure stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The system first measures wafer information, such as its position, and then uses that data during the exposure stage where the wafer is exposed to ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This "dual wielding" approach allowed for processing significantly more wafers per hour, though it added substantial complexity to the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Nikon and Canon struggled to replicate this [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | technology]] quickly enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. [[ASML]] rapidly iterated on the product's early success, and by 2002, the company held 50% of the lithography tools market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Immersion Lithography
The second breakthrough came with a generational shift in photolithography techniques known as immersion lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Previous techniques involved an air gap between the wafer and the stepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Immersion lithography replaced this air gap with water, meaning ultraviolet light is shot through water at the wafer, requiring the lens to be literally submerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. While this technique had long been used for optical microscopes and appeared in school textbooks, the industry largely ignored it until Taiwanese scientist Bern Lin demonstrated its viability for reaching a 45-nanometer process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

[[ASML]], Nikon, and Canon quickly began working on commercializing the technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. [[ASML]] was the first to succeed with its Twinscan AT1150i in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Three years later, the Twinscan XT1700i, [[ASML]]'s first volume immersion product, cemented the company's dominant position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### [[Overview of ASMLs Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography | Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography]]
The semiconductor industry recognized that immersion lithography was a stop-gap measure; eventually, the optical wavelengths then in use would be insufficient for printing the next generation of semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The industry debated between particle-based solutions (like ion and e-beam) and x-ray-based solutions, with [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV]] emerging as the chosen path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Major chipmakers collaborated with [[ASML]] to commercialize the [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. [[ASML]] required this support as practical [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | EUV systems]] arrived a decade late and significantly over budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Canon never had a chance in this area, and Nikon largely halted progress after 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV]] solidified the massive technical gap between [[ASML]] and its Japanese competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Reasons for Japan's Decline

While [[ASML]]'s victories are clear, understanding why Japan lost so badly is a complex question with several proposed theories:

### 1. Software Prowess
[[ASML]]'s machines have seen an explosion in complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. By 2000, [[ASML]]'s products used six times the number of CPUs and eight times the number of sensors compared to their 1989 counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This hardware necessitated sophisticated software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. For example, their 1989 PAS 5000 stepper had 200 million lines of source code, while their 2003 Twinscan had 1.25 billion lines, a six-fold growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. A single Twinscan contained 12.5 million lines of embedded device code orchestrating its movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. At one point, the software team exceeded 350 people, with its size doubling every four years as the codebase expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

[[ASML]] successfully managed this complexity, being one of the first companies to use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to visualize and develop software modules at an abstract level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. UML was crucial for their 2000 product shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Canon and Nikon, however, were not strong in software, and only relatively recently began adopting such abstraction-heavy software practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### 2. Decline of Japan's Semiconductor Industry
Canon and Nikon's market share initially rose concurrently with the expansion of Japan's entire semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Throughout the 1980s, Japanese companies like NEC, Mitsubishi Electric, Hitachi, and Toshiba dominated the chip-making market, particularly memory, holding 90% of the 256k DRAM market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Many of these companies formed the core market for Canon and Nikon's lithography tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

However, starting in the 1990s, low-cost Japanese semiconductor exports became a political issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Japanese companies built massive overcapacity and dumped products overseas at below cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The American semiconductor industry successfully lobbied for limits on their Japanese competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Combined with the appreciation of the yen, Japan pulled back, which significantly impacted Nikon and Canon's business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. While another large Japanese semiconductor tool supplier, Tokyo Electron, successfully looked abroad to replenish lost business, Nikon and Canon were less successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### 3. Focus Beyond Optics
Canon and Nikon originated as optics systems companies, and while they developed their entire lithography tool stack, their core focus always remained on lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. However, as semiconductor engineering pushed the limits of physics, engineers needed to find other avenues for gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

Perhaps because [[ASML]] outsourced all of its optics R&D to [[Carl Zeisss partnership with ASML | Zeiss]], it could look beyond mere optics to optimize tool performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This resulted in a superior product that better met customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Examples include optimizing for new chemicals in photoresist and photomasks, and the two-stage wafer swap process that led to the Twinscan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### 4. R&D and Industry Collaboration
R&D and industry collaboration played huge roles in [[ASML]]'s rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The [[ASML]]-Philips-[[Carl Zeisss partnership with ASML | Zeiss]] block benefited from close ties to imec, a semi-governmental nonprofit in Belgium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Imec is one of Europe's most advanced semiconductor research centers, working closely with industry and academia to develop new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Importantly, imec facilitates cross-industry collaboration, helping different semiconductor companies work together on new standards and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This exposure helps [[ASML]] understand how customers use their tools and how they interact with other vendors' equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

Evidence of [[ASML]]'s collaborative nature is seen in the numerous papers jointly published by the [[ASML]]-Philips-[[Carl Zeisss partnership with ASML | Zeiss]] block with chipmakers, toolmakers, and chemical makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Canon and Nikon, however, lacked a similar collaborative body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Most of Nikon's published papers were internal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. While Japanese companies did exchange information with outside partners, it was typically only with long-term collaborators, and these exchanges were often limited to addressing serious problems rather than fostering ideas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

It's noteworthy that the Japanese companies initially gained their leading position in the 1980s due to a similar resource-sharing effort: the VLSI project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. However, that project was government-mandated, forcing competitors to collaborate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Since then, no similar initiative has taken its place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

This lack of collaboration had direct consequences, particularly for the immersion lithography breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. While Bern Lin discovered the theoretical pathway, key breakthroughs in developing a practical commercial system came from an American researcher at MIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This researcher conducted experiments using industry-standard conditions, which would not have happened without meeting industry professionals and understanding their processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

Ties between industry and academia in Japan are notably weaker compared to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Japanese industry professionals are cautious about disclosing trade secrets to universities, and professors often focus on basic science without incentives to see their work industrialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Although Japanese universities began reforms in the mid-2000s, building technology licensing organizations similar to MIT, Stanford, and Berkeley, these changes came too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[ASML]]'s rise, while impressive, was also facilitated by the simultaneous decline in competitiveness of the Japanese companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Despite numerous theories, the precise reasons for Japan's significant loss of market share remain complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

A key lesson from this story is the importance of paying close attention to generational shifts in [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Immersion lithography and [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV]] were moments when the industry landscape fundamentally changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. In such times, winners can become losers, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This serves as a reminder for [[ASML]] to consider future shifts as researchers pursue the next generation of semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

Despite the high-profile decline of Canon and Nikon, Japan's semiconductor industry still harbors many hidden champions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. These companies, built on legacies and proficiencies from earlier years, made the right decisions, adapted to new times, and survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Though less flashy than [[ASML]] or Applied Materials, they remain crucial to the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

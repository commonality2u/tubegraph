From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Indonesia is the world's second-biggest consumer of instant noodles, with 14.5 billion servings consumed in 2023, according to the World Instant Noodles Association. An estimated 99% of its 285 million people have eaten instant noodles at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The Indonesian noodle brand Indomie is particularly popular, even becoming likely the single most popular packaged food in all of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Beginnings

The dominant position of Indomie today dates back to Indonesia's authoritarian second President, [[economic_and_political_dynamics_in_indonesia_during_suhartos_presidency | Suharto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. [[economic_and_political_dynamics_in_indonesia_during_suhartos_presidency | Suharto]] frequently partnered with Chinese entrepreneurs, such as [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim)]] and his [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]], to industrialize the economy and finance his activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This system is often associated with [[crony_capitalism_and_its_role_in_building_indonesias_largest_business_empire | crony capitalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

In 1967, [[economic_and_political_dynamics_in_indonesia_during_suhartos_presidency | Suharto]] requested food aid from the US government, primarily rice. However, the United States and Australia sent wheat instead, as they had limited rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Indonesia lacked milling facilities at the time, requiring the wheat to be milled in Singapore, which was not ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

[[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim]], with no prior knowledge of wheat, sought advice from Malaysian Chinese tycoon Robert Kuok in late 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Kuok, whose own business empire included flour mills, advised [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim]] to build mills directly in Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. In 1969, they partnered to found Bogasari Flour Mills on [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim]]'s land near Jakarta Bay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Bogasari quickly became the dominant flour miller in Indonesia, securing a concession to supply flour to Java and Sumatra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Robert Kuok initially received a 25% share in Bogasari but lost it when [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Sudono Salim]] merged Bogasari into his Indocement company, which Kuok felt was an unfair removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Instant Noodles & Indomie

Instant noodles were first popularized by Taiwanese-Japanese entrepreneur Momofuku Ando, who pioneered the flash-frying method for pre-cooking noodles after World War II. He founded Nissin, which remains a major noodle company today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

In 1972, Indonesian entrepreneur Djajadi Djaja founded the company Indomie. The name, meaning "Indonesian Noodles" ("Mie" means noodles), followed a naming style similar to Indocement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. While Indomie was not Indonesia's first instant noodle brand (Supermi launched two years earlier with Japanese technical assistance), Indomie gained an advantage by sourcing its flour locally and cheaply from Bogasari, unlike Supermi which used imported flour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## From Flour to Noodles: The Rise of Indofood

Initially, [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]]'s massive flour milling business, Bogasari, primarily sold flour to other noodle and bread makers, as Indonesians traditionally preferred rice over wheat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

However, during a rice shortage in the late 1970s, the Indonesian government requested Bogasari to provide and promote alternative foods for its military and civil officials to conserve rice for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Bogasari invested in expensive instant noodle machinery, intending to supply the government, and launched marketing campaigns to promote flour-based products like bread and noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

By the 1980s, Indonesia achieved rice self-sufficiency due to new strains, good weather, and fertilizers (the Green Revolution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This success, while an economic achievement, created a business problem for Bogasari, which had acquired capacity for 2 billion packs of instant noodles annually, but now faced excess capacity as the government no longer needed their supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

To utilize this capacity, Bogasari launched its own instant noodle brand, Sarimi, directly competing with their customer, Indomie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Sarimi quickly captured 40% of the market due to low production costs from its integrated milling business and a substantial marketing campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

In 1984, Djajadi Djaja, recognizing the market situation, merged Sarimi and Indomie to create a joint venture called Indofood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. A few years later, Indofood also acquired Supermi, consolidating the Indonesian instant noodle market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Initially, [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] owned 42.5% of the joint venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Within a few years, they acquired the remaining shares from Djajadi, who later claimed he was forced to sell after accumulating debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. After [[economic_and_political_dynamics_in_indonesia_during_suhartos_presidency | Suharto]]'s fall, Djajadi sued Indofood for compensation, but after a seven-year legal battle, the Indonesian Supreme Court ruled against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Market Dominance and Innovation

For years after its early 1970s launch, Indomie primarily sold a soup-format noodle, similar to Japanese ramen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. In 1982, Indomie introduced a soup-less, dry version called Mi Goreng ("fried noodles"), which became an instant hit due to its easier preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

By 1994, Indofood controlled approximately 80% of the Indonesian instant noodles market through its three brands: Indomie (60% share), Supermi, and Sarimi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Instant noodles are popular due to their low cost, ease of cooking, and taste, enhanced by MSG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Indofood offers over 110 flavors to accommodate Indonesia's diversity, though Mi Goreng remains the most popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The halal status of Indomie is also significant in the world's largest Muslim population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Spreading Out

In the late 1980s, Indomie noodles began expanding internationally, initially through word-of-mouth as Indonesian foreign workers brought the product abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Over time, [[indofoods_expansion_into_african_markets | Indofood]] established partnerships with local companies. Indomie has seen significant success in the Middle East and Africa, where its halal status is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. In Saudi Arabia, Indomie claims over 95% of the instant noodle market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

There is even an Indomie factory in Syria that has remained operational throughout the civil war, providing affordable food to locals, with government intervention ensuring its continued function despite high import costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

The most significant impact of Indomie's international expansion has been in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The story of Indomie's success in Nigeria is closely tied to the Tolaram Corporation, which began importing Indomie noodles from [[indofoods_expansion_into_african_markets | Indofood]] to Nigeria in 1988, eventually leading to local manufacturing and the establishment of De United Foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, contributing to [[indomie_brand_success_in_nigeria | Indomie's brand success in Nigeria]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

Indomie's success contributed to Tolaram's strategic shift away from B2B commodity products, which they perceived had no future after the [[impact_of_the_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | Asian Financial Crisis of 1997]] and the rise of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. They scaled down existing businesses like electronics and textiles to focus on consumer brands, requiring significant investment in vertical integration for raw ingredients, and addressing Nigeria's poor infrastructure by "pulling in" basic utilities like electricity and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

Historically, [[historical_economic_challenges_in_northeast_england | Northeast England]], once a powerhouse of heavy industry, experienced significant struggles following the decline of these sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The region faced challenges in identifying its next growth industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This region, the least populated in England with less than 2.7 million residents, has consistently had the lowest median gross annual earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, and as of 2012, the highest proportion of its population claiming income support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. An employment gap with the rest of the UK has existed since at least the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Its economic challenges stem from a historical over-reliance on heavy industry and rich coal mines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. De-industrialization in the 1980s left residents with few alternative industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Emerging Green Shoots

Despite a long period of economic hardship, there are now "green shoots" appearing in [[historical_economic_challenges_in_northeast_england | Northeast England]], particularly within the energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Renewable energy companies have begun investing in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. This shift indicates a growing wind industry in the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

### Dogger Bank Wind Farm
A notable example of this emerging sector is the Dogger Bank Wind Farm, which is positioned to become one of the largest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This development represents a positive turn for a region that has faced significant economic difficulties for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

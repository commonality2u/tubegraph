From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Recent discussions in Taiwan, particularly following local elections and the anticipated 2024 startup of [[tsmc_n2_process_node_and_new_fabs | TSMC Arizona]], have amplified concerns that the U.S. is attempting to "steal" [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article aims to address these anxieties by examining the details of TSMC's U.S. expansion in the broader context of its global strategy and the semiconductor industry.

The author, an American with family ties to Taiwan and many years of residency there, notes that these concerns are understandable but require a closer look at the facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## The TSMC Arizona Fab: Plans and Evolution

[[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] first announced its plans for a production facility in Arizona in May 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Initially, there were concerns about whether this project would suffer the same fate as Foxconn in Wisconsin, though this comparison is no longer frequently made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

The original plan for the Arizona facility was to produce N5 chips, which were, at the time, the most advanced node [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] had attempted to bring outside Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. People in Taiwan found comfort in two key aspects of this initial plan:
*   **Small Scale:** The Arizona site was relatively small, projected to produce about 20,000 300mm wafers per month, significantly less than Taiwan's four gigafabs, which produce over 100,000 wafers a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Leading Edge Status:** It was presumed that by the time the Arizona factory came online in 2024, N3, the next full node step, would be in high volume production in Taiwan, meaning N5 would no longer be the "leading edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Recent Announcements and Upgrades

Shortly before a significant "tool-in" ceremony in December, [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] made several new announcements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>:
*   The first Arizona fab would bring the N4 process, an upgrade to the pre-existing N5 line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] is investing an additional $28 billion over three years to open a second Arizona factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This second fab will be equipped with N3 technology, which is expected to enter high-volume production by 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   Despite these expansions, [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] remains committed to keeping its most advanced nodes, such as [[tsmc_n2_process_node_and_new_fabs | N2]] and N1, in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. [[tsmc_n2_process_node_and_new_fabs | N2]] production is slated for 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

These developments, alongside discussions of plans for a specialty n28 plant in Japan and a potential plant in Germany, represent a shift from [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]]'s long-standing norm of keeping its most advanced operations in Taiwan, which understandably causes nervousness in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Drivers of TSMC's Overseas Expansion

The impetus for [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]]'s expansion, particularly in the U.S., is a confluence of demand and financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Customer Demand

[[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] operates as a commercial entity in close communication with its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Apple, which accounts for approximately 25% of [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]]'s total revenue, is a singular customer that largely bankrolls the most advanced chip rollouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]]'s rise is directly linked to Apple's decision to shift from [[competition_between_tsmc_and_samsung | Samsung]] to [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] for chip production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Apple CEO Tim Cook stated their decision to buy from a plant in Arizona starting in 2024, and also expressed interest in sourcing from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] will follow if Apple demands sourcing from the U.S. and the economics align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Competitive Landscape and Subsidies

[[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] cannot risk Apple returning to [[competition_between_tsmc_and_samsung | Samsung]] or defecting to [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Intel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Both competitors are building significant new facilities in the United States:
*   [[competition_between_tsmc_and_samsung | Samsung]] has a $17 billion plant in Taylor, Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Intel]] has a $20 billion chip plant in Columbus, Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

These large build-outs are supported by the $50 billion in subsidies allocated by the [[economic_viability_of_smics_chip_production | CHIPS Act of 2022]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Strategically, [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] aims to take these subsidies to reduce the funding available for [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Intel]] and [[competition_between_tsmc_and_samsung | Samsung]]'s expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Is America "Stealing" TSMC? A Detailed Rebuttal

The notion that America is "stealing" [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] needs to be examined in the context of technology transfer and economic scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### No Forced Technology Transfer

Genuine technology transfer typically involves joint ventures with indigenous companies, specific requirements for local content, and enhanced knowledge transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. The Arizona expansion does not fit this model:
*   [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] is not engaging in a joint venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   With the exception of an SSMC fab in Singapore, [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] has always owned its fabs outright, even in mainland China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   The risk of an executive leaving to start a competing company exists independently of an Arizona fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Scale of Investment: Taiwan Dominates

Claims that America has "stolen" a significant portion of Taiwan's manufacturing, causing "massive loss" to its economy, are not supported by the scale of [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]]'s investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

*   **Capital Expenditure:** [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]]'s capital expenditure was about $36 billion in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The second Arizona fab investment adds about $28 billion over three years, or roughly $9 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This represents 25-30% of the proposed annual capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The majority of the company's spending will **still be in Taiwan** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Wafer Shipments:** In 2021, [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] shipped 14.2 million 300mm equivalent wafers, projected to be 15-16 million this year, or about 1.3 million wafers per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. A significant majority (75-85%) of these are produced in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. When the first Arizona fab starts production in 2024, it will produce around 20,000 wafers per month, which is less than 1/50th of current annual production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Even after planned expansion to 50,000 wafers per month in 2026, it will still be insufficient to shift the balance significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Continued Investment in Taiwan

[[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] is actively managing at least five other major build-outs in Taiwan:
*   New phases to existing Taiwanese fabs, including expansions in Tainan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   New [[tsmc_n2_process_node_and_new_fabs | N2 plants]] in Baoshan and potentially Taichung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   Future plans for an N1 plant in the Longtan District of Southern Taoyuan City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   The Kaohsiung Fab, originally planned for N28 and N7, is moving ahead with N28 construction, despite a rollback on N7 due to low utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

Taiwan remains [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]]'s greatest asset, and the company has no choice but to go "all in" on Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Broader Semiconductor Supply Chain and Taiwan's Enduring Role

The problematic assumption is that the Arizona fab makes America self-sufficient in silicon, which is far from true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Types of Chips and Other Foundries

*   The majority of the world's industrially important semiconductors (for fridges, airplanes, cars) are not leading-edge N4 and N3 chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:10:01]</a>. These are older, high-volume, low-price chips like 130nm, 65nm, and n28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   Taiwan also hosts other significant semiconductor foundries like UMC (number three largest), Powerchip (seventh), and Vanguard (eighth), each with specialty processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### Packaging, Assembly, and Testing (OSAT)

Taiwan holds leading positions in the rest of the chip supply chain, including wafers, packaging, assembly, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. America's position in global packaging, assembly, and test capacity is even worse than its fabrication market share (3% vs. 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. While the U.S. might have a chance in advanced packaging for high-performance computing, there is no Arizona fab or government funding for conventional packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

Taiwan is home to three of the world's five largest outsourced semiconductor packaging, assembly, and testing (OSAT) companies, including the largest by far, ASE Group, along with SPIL and Powertech Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. These "underrated" companies are crucial to the global supply chain, and duplicating them would be economically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

### Managerial Expertise

Crucially, the thousands of difficult-to-replace managers running the fabs, including R&D, operations, and supply chain management personnel, are primarily located in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This deep industrial development, built over 50 years, extends beyond semiconductor manufacturing to electronics assembly and specialty plastics, and cannot be replicated quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## Conclusion

The notion that America is "stealing" [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] is largely a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. While the Arizona fabs are significant, they represent only a fraction of [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]]'s global investment and production capacity, with Taiwan remaining the overwhelming focus for advanced nodes and overall operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The U.S. expansion is driven by commercial demand, competition, and government incentives rather than a "theft" of technology or manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Taiwan's comprehensive role in the semiconductor supply chain, extending beyond just leading-edge fabrication, ensures its continued indispensable position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

The China-Taiwan scenario remains a systemic risk that cannot be easily hedged against simply by investing in other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. For the foreseeable future, the status quo of Taiwan's central role in the global semiconductor industry is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

In 1995, over 30 companies were competing to build graphics chips for personal computers. Six years later, only three remained, with Nvidia in the lead, indicating a significant consolidation in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This rapid evolution and market consolidation were heavily influenced by the emergence and popularity of 3D gaming.

## Early Graphics Hardware and the Rise of 3D Concepts

The idea of separate hardware handling complex 3D graphics tasks predates Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:46">[01:57:46]</a>. Early Atari video game consoles in the 1970s had graphics chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:05">[02:06:05]</a>. Commercial video cards, which plugged into the main computer, appeared in the 1980s, such as the IBM Professional Graphics Controller (PGA), released in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:21">[02:13:21]</a>. The PGA used an onboard Intel AD88 microprocessor to free up the computer's CPU for other tasks, though its high cost ($4,000-$5,000) and IBM PC exclusivity limited its market success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:54">[02:27:54]</a>.

In the late 1980s, Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) emerged as a dominant graphics player, refining the concept of a graphics pipeline, which translates coordinates to 2D pixel space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a>. In 1992, SGI released OpenGL, a public 3D graphic standard (API) with 120 commands for drawing points, lines, and polygons, which became widely adopted and a critical factor in graphics hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:02">[03:09:02]</a>. SGI hardware dominated the profitable graphics workstation space but did not seriously pursue the consumer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:07">[03:26:07]</a>.

## The Dawn of Consumer 3D Gaming

Consumer interest in graphics significantly increased with the release of Microsoft Windows 3.1 in 1990, which featured a graphical user interface (GUI) and sold over 2 million units in its first six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:13">[03:39:13]</a>. However, it was the 1993 release of the 3D game *Doom* by id Software that truly ignited consumer demand for graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:04">[03:55:04]</a>. *Doom* offered a mature, action-packed first-person shooter experience, breaking from the "Nintendo-ish" toys common at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:13">[04:04:13]</a>.

In 1996, id Software released *Quake*, which brought new technical breakthroughs such as full real-time 3D rendering and online multiplayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:16">[04:17:16]</a>. While *Quake* sold well, PC owners found their computers often couldn't run the game at full specifications, leading to poor visuals and slow performance, especially in online deathmatches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:02">[04:31:02]</a>. To address this, programmer John Carmack rewrote the game to support OpenGL, creating *GLQuake*, which spurred significant innovation in the consumer video card space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:19">[04:54:19]</a>.

### The Rise of Dedicated 3D Acceleration

A graphics chip startup, 3dfx, quickly capitalized on *GLQuake* as a "killer app" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:05">[05:07:05]</a>. They created a wrapper program to make OpenGL compatible with their proprietary Glide graphics API and leveraged a drop in RAM prices to launch the Voodoo video card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. The Voodoo was the first consumer video card capable of running *GLQuake* very well (640x480 resolution at 16-bit color and 30 frames per second) for about $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:14">[05:33:14]</a>. Crucially, the Voodoo only offered 3D acceleration, requiring users to have a separate 2D acceleration card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:02">[05:48:02]</a>. Despite this, it sold very well, and 3dfx held 80% of the 3D acceleration graphics card market at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:04">[05:55:04]</a>.

## Nvidia's Strategic Response

While 3dfx dominated, Nvidia, founded in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>, was just starting. After their initial product, the NV1, flopped due to technical compromises and incompatibility with leading APIs like OpenGL and 3dfx's Glide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:27">[08:00:27]</a>, Nvidia pivoted its strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:15">[11:22:15]</a>.

Nvidia made three key bets:
1.  **Adoption of Direct3D**: Microsoft quickly noticed the growing trend of 3D PC games, with consumers outfitting their PCs with graphics tools rivaling mid-range workstations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. In 1996, Microsoft acquired RenderMorphics and created its own 3D graphics API, Direct3D, as part of the DirectX bundle, integrated into Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:21">[09:25:21]</a>. Despite initial criticism from developers like John Carmack, Microsoft promised future improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. Nvidia bet its future on Direct3D's eventual dominance due to its tight integration with Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:04">[11:33:04]</a>.
2.  **Vertical Integration of Device Drivers**: Most device drivers were written by board partners (OEMs), leading to mismatched incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:04">[12:16:04]</a>. Nvidia opted to write its own drivers in-house, aligning incentives and allowing them to produce high-performing drivers for all their hardware, which became a cornerstone of their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:02">[12:40:02]</a>.
3.  **Outsourced Manufacturing and Moore's Law**: Nvidia partnered with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in 1998, ending their agreement with SGS-Thompson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>. TSMC pledged never to compete with its partners, aligning interests for mutual success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:19">[15:04:19]</a>. This allowed Nvidia to focus entirely on chip design, optimizing for speed and rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:14">[15:53:14]</a>. Nvidia organized its teams for a relentless six-month product cycle, delivering a new chip generation every half-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:48">[16:40:48]</a>.

Nvidia's second product, the Riva 128, launched in 1997 with less than six weeks of cash left in the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. It was designed to accelerate Direct3D and, critically, supported both 3D and 2D graphics, a functionality the 3dfx Voodoo lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:26">[13:29:26]</a>. The Riva 128 sold well, retailing for about $140 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:24">[13:51:24]</a>.

## Market Consolidation and Key Missteps

The brutal pace set by Nvidia's product cycle began to decimate the graphics card industry, with companies dropping out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>. Only ATI was able to keep up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:07">[16:55:07]</a>.

3dfx, the market leader, made a critical error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. Struggling to develop a competitive 3D/2D follow-up to the Voodoo, they acquired boardmaker STB in December 1998 for $141 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>. They then announced that their chips would only be available in their own name-branded boards, directly competing with their former customers, who promptly defected to Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. 3dfx's management had no prior manufacturing experience, and STB's facilities couldn't compete with Asian manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>. The division became a cash drain, and 3dfx eventually dissolved, selling its assets to Nvidia in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>.

Intel also attempted to enter the discrete graphics card market. In 1996, Intel predicted that 80% of PCs would have 3D graphics by 2000 and that they would dominate the space by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>. Their influence was so significant that Microsoft canceled its own line of graphics hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:00">[19:24:00]</a>. In 1998, Intel released the Intel 740 card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:00">[19:31:00]</a>. However, it used the AGP port, which Intel tried to popularize, while most of the market stuck with PCI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. The card also lagged in real-world performance and Intel, accustomed to longer CPU development cycles, couldn't keep up with the rapid pace of the graphics market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>. The i740 was quickly discontinued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>.

Despite this failure, Intel continued to tinker in the integrated graphics processor space, which uses system memory instead of dedicated memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>. Leveraging its CPU monopoly, Intel built massive market share in integrated graphics. While not top-of-the-line, Intel's integrated solutions "worked well enough for most low-end users," wiping out the market for low-margin, low-performance discrete graphics cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34:00">[20:34:00]</a>.

## A Consolidated Market and the Future of the [[Nvidias innovation with general processing unit concept|GPU]]

By the early 2000s, the graphics card space, driven by the demands of 3D gaming, had drastically consolidated from over 30 companies to just three: Nvidia, ATI (later acquired by AMD in 2006 for $5.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>), and Intel taking up the low end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>.

Nvidia's strategic [[Nvidias innovation with general processing unit concept|vertical integration expansion]] into device drivers proved to be a lasting competitive edge, unlike 3dfx's value-destroying venture into manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>.

The intense competition spurred by 3D gaming and the race for better graphics technology led Nvidia to look beyond just providing graphics chipsets. In 1999, they coined the phrase "general processing unit" (GPU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:59:00">[21:59:00]</a>, popularizing the concept of general-purpose computing and envisioning applications beyond video game graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>. This vision would later become crucial for fields like [[neural_network_revolution_and_role_of_gpus|neural networks]] and [[impact_of_gpu_acceleration_on_computational_lithography|computational lithography]].

The [[fukushima_disaster_and_nuclear_meltdown | Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant]] suffered a massive meltdown in March 2011, caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent tsunami that disabled its cooling systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Without proper cooling, the plant's nuclear fuel melted down, leading to several hydrogen explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The plant's owner, TEPCO, and the Japanese government have committed billions of dollars to the site's safe and efficient decommissioning, relying on advanced radiation-hardened robots to minimize human safety risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### State of Fukushima Units After the Accident

The Fukushima Daiichi plant has six units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Units 4, 5, and 6 were not operational when the accident occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:
*   **Units 5 and 6** were separated from units 1-4 and suffered only minor damage from the tsunami, remaining essentially fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Unit 4** was damaged by the tsunami and experienced a hydrogen explosion due to exhaust spillover from Unit 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. However, because its reactor was shut down, the fuel rods sustained little damage, making the radiation dosage tolerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Units 1 through 3** were in operation when the tsunami hit and suffered the worst damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. All three experienced meltdowns, and Units 1 and 3 also had hydrogen explosions, releasing radioactive materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Initial Robot Deployment

The first robot arrived at Fukushima in April 2011, three weeks after the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Four military multipurpose robots from the American company iRobot Corporation USA, part of their Pakbot series, were brought in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. These robots, previously used in Iraq and Afghanistan for detecting and diffusing improvised explosive devices, were deployed into the damaged and irradiated Unit 1, 2, and 3 reactor buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. They measured radiation dosage, atmospheric temperatures, and oxygen concentrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

Other robots used in the initial response included:
*   **Warrior (iRobot)**: A larger robot used for cleaning work, vacuuming and clearing obstacles in the second half of 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Bobcat** and the **Swedish-built Brock 90** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **T-Hawk (Honeywell)**: A small unmanned aerial vehicle that flew over Units 1 through 4 to assess the situation and collect dust samples from April to July 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Japanese Robotics and the "Controversy"

The initial reliance on American robots sparked mild controversy, as Japan is renowned for its robotics technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. After a criticality accident in 1999, Japanese technology centers had developed nuclear disaster robots, notably the "Remote Surveillance Squad" or "Rescue Robots" by what is now the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, these robots received few upgrades after their completion in 2001, reportedly due to a lack of budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. When the Fukushima disaster occurred ten years later, the robots were not ready, suffering from a lack of maintenance, outdated components, and no trained operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

The JAEA re-engineered a Rescue robot into the JAEA-3 by September 2011, incorporating parts from the Brock robot, but by then, another Japanese robot had gained prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

#### The Kinsei Robot

While Pakbot was successful, its radio communication system limited its reach deep into the first floor, and its treads made navigating stairs difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. TEPCO needed a robot to install a water gauge and take samples of contaminated water in the reactor building basement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

TEPCO turned to a series of search and rescue robots developed by the Chiba Institute of Technology, called Kinsei (Spanish for "15") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Kinsei, with continuous tracks, was designed to be waterproof and highly mobile across difficult terrain, originally for underground malls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. TEPCO requested modifications, primarily to harden the robots against radioactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

##### Radiation Hardening

Nuclear accidents release various forms of radiation, including alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, X-rays, and neutron particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. When these particles interact with semiconductor material, two main effects can occur:
*   **Displacement Effect**: Particles like neutrons and alpha particles collide with semiconductors, displacing atoms and shifting structural arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This alters device properties, leading to higher current leakage and decreased lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Ionization Effect**: Electrons, protons, and X-rays pass through semiconductors, creating electron-hole pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This can cause permanent glitches and erratic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

These effects can accumulate over time, disabling the entire system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Radiation hardening must be performed at device, circuit, and system levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>:
*   **Device Level**: Modifying transistor layout, adding insulating substrates (e.g., silicon on insulator), or making devices larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Circuit Level**: Duplicating critical circuits or adding monitoring circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **System Level**: Adding radiation armor, redundancies, and preventive scrubbing algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Kinsei was built from conventional electronics, so its radiation resistance was unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Gamma ray testing revealed that Kinsei's essential components (including its 180nm CPU, motherboard, and motor driver boards) could survive a dose of about 200 Grays (20,000 rads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Initial measurements during the disaster response indicated doses of around 100 Grays, suggesting Kinsei could operate for over 100 hours with about a 10% chance of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

After further modifications, the new Kinsei entered the reactor buildings in June 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. In October 2011, after five successful missions, a broken communications link forced the team to abandon the robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Kinsei 2 and 3 were redesigned to fix this flaw and deployed in February 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Decommissioning and Cleanup Operations

The Japanese government's long-term goals involve gradually decommissioning the plant and rebuilding the surrounding area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This multi-step process is overseen by TEPCO and the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning (IRID) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

#### 1. Site Cleanup and Decontamination

The accident's hydrogen explosions scattered rubble across the site, which must be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Astaco-Sora (Hitachi)**: A heavy-duty robot developed to collect rubble using its two arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Raccoon** and **Arounder**: Smaller cleaner bots that spray down the ground around reactor Unit 2 or other areas with high-pressure water jets or dry ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Meister**: A heavy-duty robot capable of drilling for samples or vacuuming particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

#### 2. Spent Fuel Rod Removal

Each unit contains a spent fuel assembly storing fuel no longer useful for energy generation, which must be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Unit 4**: In December 2014, TEPCO successfully removed 1,535 spent fuel rods from the damaged Unit 4 reactor pool, placing them in a cooling pool in Unit 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Unit 3**: In 2019, TEPCO began removing 566 spent fuel rods, completing this task in February 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Units 1 and 2**: Removal of spent fuel rods for these units is scheduled to begin in 2023 or later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

#### 3. Nuclear Fuel Debris (Corium) Inspection and Removal

In Units 1 through 3, the fuel melted down, burning through the reactor pressure vessel and the concrete pedestal, eventually reaching the primary containment vessel (PCV) before being cooled by emergency water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This resolidified material, officially named corium, must be inspected and removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. IRID uses different robots for each reactor due to their unique circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

##### Unit 1 Inspection
Unit 1's nuclear reactor PCV is flooded to a depth of 2 meters, likely with corium at its bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   In 2012, TEPCO punched a small hole into the PCV to run a wired camera and conduct water tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   In 2014, IRID developed a "p-morph" robot designed to squeeze through a 100mm hole, then twist into a U-shape to travel around a lead plate for radiation shielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The first p-morph encountered an obstacle and had to be left inside, but improvements led to mission completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The next step is to build a robot to collect the pebble-like nuclear fuel debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

##### Unit 2 Inspection
Unit 2 suffered a meltdown but no hydrogen explosion, leaving its building structure relatively intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   TEPCO developed a robot called "Scorpion," which could crawl through a small hole and then reconfigure itself for better mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   Scorpion was deployed in 2017, but its left tread failed, and it was left inside the reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   The team eventually photographed the entire inside of the reactor using a camera on what resembled a fishing rod, stitching multiple shots to create a panorama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

##### Unit 3 Inspection
The corium inside Unit 3 was the last to be photographed because its PCV is almost entirely flooded to a depth of about 6 meters, requiring new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   The entrance approach used for Unit 2 was not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. A robot in 2015 reached only the first-floor grating outside the pedestal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   It took about two years to build a suitable robot for the task: the "Mini Manbo" (little sunfish), a tiny robot just 13 centimeters across and 30 centimeters long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   In 2017, the Mini Manbo successfully recorded video of the nuclear debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

##### Debris Removal
Now that the nuclear fuel debris has been located, IRID and TEPCO have decided to begin collecting and removing it from Unit 2 first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. They plan to build a massive stainless steel robotic arm that will sit outside the PCV, reach in through a hole, and pick up the debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. The project start is delayed into 2023 to improve the arm's capabilities and add attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. IRID expects it will take at least 10 years to remove all nuclear fuel debris from the Fukushima site, with further work needed for cleaning and decontamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

Despite the ongoing challenges, conditions have improved enough for the government to allow local residents to return to their homes, with the evacuation order for Kuma, the town closest to the plant, lifted in April 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. However, only a small percentage of residents have returned, indicating the significant work remaining for both people and robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

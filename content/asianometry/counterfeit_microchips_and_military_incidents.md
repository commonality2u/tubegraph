In 2020, an F-16 ejection seat malfunctioned, resulting in the pilot's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. An investigation of the seat's essential component, the sequencer, revealed that several microchips inside were counterfeit or fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While the specific role of these chips in this incident remains unclear, it highlights the significant risk that fake chips pose in critical situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This incident is indicative of the broader [[semiconductor_industrys_counterfeit_chip_problem | semiconductor industry's counterfeit chip problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Defining Counterfeit Semiconductors

The Department of Defense (DoD) offers two simple definitions for a counterfeit semiconductor:
1.  A previously used electronic part sold as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
2.  Unauthorized copies of an authentic electronic product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

The industry's more comprehensive taxonomy defines a counterfeit semiconductor as such if <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>:
*   It is an unauthorized copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   It does not conform to the original manufacturer's design, model, or performance standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   It is not produced by the original manufacturer or its authorized contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   It is off-specification, already used, defective, or misleadingly labeled as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   It is incorrectly marked or has wrong documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Scale of the Problem

Counterfeit semiconductors represent a significant business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. In 2019, the OECD estimated that the global volume of counterfeit and pirated products accounted for up to 3.3% of total global trade, exceeding $500 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

Data sources are often incomplete due to the illicit nature of the trade and victim's reluctance to report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>:
*   **Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP):** This government counterfeit parts database is not anonymous, leading victims to avoid reporting incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Electronic Resellers Association International (ERAI):** This corporation monitors incidents reported by buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. In 2022, they recorded 504 reported semiconductor counterfeit cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This was a sharp drop from 963 cases in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **US Congressional Committee (2011):** An investigation into counterfeit electronic parts in the military supply chain quoted an estimate from the Semiconductor Industry Association, stating that counterfeiting cost the American semiconductor manufacturing industry over $7.5 billion annually in lost revenue and 11,000 jobs in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Bureau of Industry Security (2010):** A report identified 7,114 detected counterfeited microcircuit incidents across 387 companies within the defense industry in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, a significant increase from 3,400 reported incidents in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

Counterfeited semiconductors span all types, from microprocessors to analog, memory, and radio frequency chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Their resale value ranges from 11 cents to $500, with most falling in the 11 cents to $10 range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Military Incidents and Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

During a 2011 Senate panel hearing, several incidents of counterfeit semiconductors entering military supply chains were highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **P-8A Poseidon Incident:** An ice detection module on a P-8A Poseidon plane, designed to warn pilots of ice formation, contained a counterfeit component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The component, labeled as a Xilinx FPGA unit, was fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Boeing discovered the issue when the part fell out of its socket and rattled inside the module after the plane took off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The module's manufacturer, BAE, had purchased 300 such FPGAs from a California company that only tested 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Investigators traced the counterfeit chip back to an affiliate of an electronics manufacturer in Shenzhen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

Defense Department contractors and commercial system integrators face a difficult challenge: they often need to use old parts for repair and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. For example, the F-15 plane, introduced over 45 years ago, uses parts that original suppliers no longer manufacture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This forces them to procure parts from often "shady secondhand suppliers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Government Accountability

Despite these challenges, the US government places the onus of detecting and filtering out counterfeit chips on contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. In January 2013, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was signed into law, threatening contractors with civil and criminal penalties for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

A notable case involved **Vision Tech** in Florida, which knowingly sold fake chips disguised as trademarked military-grade goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Vision Tech employees were instructed to tell customers that chips came from Europe, despite knowing they originated from China and Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. They also sent legitimate chips for samples but fake chips for purchased shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The company generated nearly $16 million in sales from these goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. While the owner died before sentencing, the administrative manager received a 38-month prison sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Types of Counterfeit Chips Affecting Military Supply

### Recycled Chips
Recycling is one of the most common ways counterfeit chips enter the supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The process involves:
1.  Receiving scrap electronics and removing printed circuit boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
2.  Heating boards over an open flame to melt solder and loosen components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
3.  Bashing boards against a hard surface to dislodge components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
4.  Removing original markings from components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
5.  Sorting, reprocessing, and applying new coats and markings to make them appear new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

These e-waste components are already old and worn out, and the harvesting process subjects them to further damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Many of these chips simply won't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### Relabeled or Remarked Chips
These chips do not match their stated identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Markings, which convey information about a chip's model, origin, and certifications, are changed to mislead users about capabilities and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. For military components, where chips require hardening against radiation or temperature damage, suppliers may substitute cheaper commercial parts that have similar functions but lack the necessary hardening requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

Recycling and remarking combined account for about 80% of total counterfeiting incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Unauthorized Clones
Unauthorized clones are similar to foundry overproduction but originate from a third party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. These third parties clone chips to save on expensive R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Design IP for clones can be obtained through reverse engineering (using an electron microscope) or by illegally acquiring the chip's design IP at various stages of the design and manufacturing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

Clone semiconductor counterfeits are harder to detect because they are often functionally similar to authentic parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. However, they may deviate in technology and process, leading to erratic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## [[methods_of_detecting_counterfeit_chips | Methods of Detecting Counterfeit Chips]]

Counterfeit chips often enter products because contractors lack documented supply chain history or fail to conduct thorough inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. There are two primary [[methods_of_detecting_counterfeit_chips | methods of inspecting potentially counterfeit chips]]:
*   **Physical Methods:** These look for defects in the chip's exterior, shipping, packaging, connections, IC packaging, bonding wires, or die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Techniques include external visual inspection (EVI), X-ray, or even de-capping the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Some of these methods are destructive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Electrical Methods:** These test for changes in the chip's component parameters (parametric test) or whether the chip functions properly (functional test) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. While effective, they can be time-consuming and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

Detecting counterfeits is nuanced, requiring a balance between detection effectiveness and financial/time constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Best practices involve designing tests that provide high confidence rather than total assurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## [[anticounterfeiting_measures_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Anti-Counterfeiting Measures]]

With recycling being a significant problem and package remarking becoming harder to detect, fabulous designers can incorporate [[anticounterfeiting_measures_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | designed for counterfeit measures]] into their chip designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>:
*   **Unique ID:** A simple measure is to give a chip a unique ID programmed into non-programmable memory, easily readable throughout its lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Physical Unclonable Feature (PUF):** This [[anticounterfeiting_measures_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | anti-counterfeiting design]] creates a unique fingerprint for the chip, utilizing random variables in the semiconductor fabrication process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. An Arbiter PUF, for example, produces a random but repeatable output string when a signal (challenge) is sent through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

However, counterfeiters can still tamper with these methods, or they may be prohibitively difficult to implement due to cost or technical reasons, such as lack of space on the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

## Global Context and [[impact_of_recycled_and_fake_chips_on_global_trade | Impact of Recycled and Fake Chips on Global Trade]]

Most counterfeit chips, especially recycled ones, enter the supply chain due to opportunity and incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. In 2019, only 17.4% of the world's electronic waste was documented as collected and recycled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Harvesting and de-soldering old chips from e-waste can cost as little as 10 cents per chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, while certain types of chips can sell for $1 to $10 or more, leading to significant profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

Historically, most fake recycled and relabeled chips came from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, where much of the e-waste was processed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. However, in 2017, China banned the import of 24 types of solid waste, including plastic and e-waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. This policy shift has redirected significant e-waste imports to new countries; for instance, Thailand saw a 5.7 times increase in e-waste imports in 2017 after the China ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

The modern world relies on semiconductors functioning properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. A chip that is not what it claims to be can cause serious harm, whether in a soldier's equipment, a component in a plane, or a car's brakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

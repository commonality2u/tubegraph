Compaq's early years saw "absolutely insane growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, with first-year revenue of $111 million in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> and reaching $1.2 billion in revenue by 1987, making it the fastest company in history to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Compaq led an insurgency of IBM PC clone-makers, overwhelming IBM and unlocking the PC standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. However, as the saying goes, "the revolution turned on them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Initial Advantages Turning into Weaknesses

[[compaqs_business_strategies_and_innovations | Compaq's business strategies]] in its early years relied on several growth engines:
*   **Breakthrough Product:** Offering a product compatible with, yet differentiated from, the IBM PC (e.g., the Compaq Portable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, and ensuring deep compatibility with IBM's software ecosystem like Lotus 1-2-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Speed:** A faster product development cycle (6-9 months versus IBM's 12-18 months) allowed them to bring new technologies to market quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, notably with the Deskpro 386 hitting the market a year before IBM had a similar product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Distribution:** Compaq made retailers their sole distribution channel, fostering dealer loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This saved money by avoiding a large sales force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

However, this reliance on retailers, initially a strength, eventually became a "fatal weakness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a> as the market evolved.

## Attack of the Clones and Price Pressure

The PC ecosystem became highly modular, with performance increasingly dependent on only Microsoft's OS software and Intel's silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This made it easy for new entrants like Dell and Gateway to introduce their own "high-powered PC 'super-clones'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

These new competitors offered products "just as powerful as Compaq's products, and cheaper too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Price differences stemmed from cheaper materials, offshore labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, or new business models like direct-selling via telephone or mail-order, which cut out dealer markups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Dell, for example, directly compared its offerings and prices to Compaq's in advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Consumers consistently paid a 67% premium for a Compaq compared to a similar Gateway 2000 system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Compaq was slow to respond or even acknowledge this price challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Lack of Self-Generated Innovation and Missed Opportunities

Compaq was fast to integrate new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, but produced few of these innovations themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, investing only about 4% of revenues into R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This left them beholden to critical partners like Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

Compaq also missed opportunities to enter and corner new markets:
*   **Laptops:** Despite CEO Rod Canion's personal desire for a laptop in early 1984, market research indicated the market was "not that big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Even after Toshiba's T3100 sold well in 1986, Compaq waited until October 1988 to introduce its own laptop, the SLT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   This reliance on market research and slow adaptation made Compaq "ill equipped to keep up with this rapidly changing business environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

## Economic Downturn and Internal Disagreement (1990-1991)

The First Gulf War in August 1990 caused oil shocks and a mini-recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Lower company budgets led to increased price-consciousness, accelerating the growth of cheaper clones and forcing Compaq to cut hardware prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

A growing divide emerged between management and stakeholders regarding the market landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Chairman Ben Rosen, an original investor, expressed concern that Compaq's management was not moving as fast as the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

In May 1991, Compaq pre-announced an 81% fall in Q2 1991 profits, causing the stock to drop 27%, losing $1.2 billion in market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Despite this, management insisted these were "short-term perturbations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

The disagreement culminated in October 1991 when Rosen demanded a low-end PC in three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Rod Canion argued it was impossible without sacrificing quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. Rosen revealed he had two Compaq employees assemble two demo PCs from off-the-shelf parts in three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Canion's refusal to bend led to his firing by Rosen, with Eckhard Pfeiffer stepping in as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

## Pfeiffer's Turnaround and New Challenges

Pfeiffer initiated a price war, cutting prices across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a> and unveiling new low-cost lines like the ProLinea and Contura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. He expanded distribution to computer superstores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. This led to a "remarkably fast turnaround" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>, with revenues growing to $4.1 billion in 1992 and $7 billion in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. By 1995, Compaq became the world's largest PC maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

However, this victory marked the end of easy growth in the PC market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Competition intensified, particularly from Dell, whose notebooks and servers began eating into Compaq's market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

*   **Distribution Dilemma:** Compaq's dependency on external distributors and retailers, while enabling sales in over 100 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>, hindered their ability to adopt Dell's direct-selling model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. Adopting direct sales risked alienating existing partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. It wasn't until 1998 that Compaq finally began adopting Dell's direct-sales model, but it was "too little, too late" to close Dell's 10-15% cost advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

## A Series of Unfortunate Acquisitions

Pfeiffer believed Compaq's future lay in growing beyond mere PCs to become a global computer services company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. This led to [[compaqs_acquisitions_and_their_impact | a series of unfortunate acquisitions]]:
*   **Networth (late 1995) and Microcom (May 1997):** To build a networking business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.
*   **Tandem Computer Incorporated (June 1997):** Acquired for $4 billion, Tandem specialized in fault-tolerant computers for critical 24/7 services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) (January 1998):** A record $9.6 billion acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. DEC was famous for minicomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>, but its core high-end Internet server and [[the_workstation_market_and_competition | workstation market]] businesses were struggling against disruptive competition from cheap Unix computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.

Despite the analysts' approval of the DEC acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>, Pfeiffer struggled to bridge the two company cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. There was "little push to capitalize on DEC's considerable technology assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. Meanwhile, Compaq's core PC business continued to deteriorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

## End of Pfeiffer and Continued Decline

In April 1999, Ben Rosen and the board fired Pfeiffer due to his expensive acquisition spree and inability to integrate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. Michael Capellas, the Chief Information Officer, took over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. Despite efforts to improve finances and gain traction with direct selling, the core PC business continued to melt away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. In September 1999, Dell overtook Compaq as the leading PC seller in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.

The bursting Dotcom bubble in 2000 further devastated DEC's high-end Internet server businesses and flooded the market with excess PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>. These mounting challenges eventually led Compaq to explore a merger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>, culminating in its acquisition by Hewlett-Packard in September 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.

Compaq's story highlights how leading a revolution doesn't guarantee sustained success. The company struggled to adapt to increasing commoditization, intense price competition, and new business models, ultimately losing its leading position in the PC market.

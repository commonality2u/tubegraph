Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) is China's project to replace [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Recent high-profile export bans to China have brought special focus to SMEE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Despite ambitious goals and significant government support, China faces considerable [[challenges_in_semiconductor_lithography | challenges]] in its [[development_and_future_prospects_of_chinas_lithography_systems | development]] of advanced [[challenges_in_semiconductor_lithography | lithography technology]].

## Historical Technology Gap

China's first [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography machine]], the GK3, was created in 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The GK4 prototype, a contact [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography machine]] in 1978, was able to print chips on 75 millimeter wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. However, the United States had invented and commercialized contact [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] in the 1950s, placing China two decades behind at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Further efforts to develop proximity aligners and steppers in the 1980s still left a large technology gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. By 2000, when China began [[impact_of_industry_collaboration_and_research_on_lithography | research]] on machines using argon fluoride lasers (193 nanometer wavelength), the West had been shipping such devices since 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Import Restrictions and Reliance on Foreign Components

[[challenges_in_semiconductor_lithography | Lithography technology]] is a highly protected space dominated by three companies with government backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. SMEE has encountered import restrictions almost from its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. For example, high-level optics from Carl Zeiss of Germany, considered their "best stuff," could not be imported into China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

This forces SMEE to rely on domestic suppliers for critical components like optics and light sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   SMEE's Carl Zeiss equivalent optics suppliers were identified as Changchun Up Optotech (no longer associated with SMEE) and Beijing Guowang Technology Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Beijing Guowang is building an optics manufacturing factory, but it is not expected to supply an immersion-ready optical system in mass until its completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   SMEE's light source supplier, Beijing RS Laser Opto Electronics Technology, produces a product that is "underpowered" compared to what [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] uses for their immersion systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

A number of core technologies still need to be imported or purchased from foreign companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. These include:
*   Photo masks: The vast majority are made by Japanese companies Toppan Printing and Dai Nippon Printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   Ball bearings from Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   Valves from France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   Grating alignment systems from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
Without these imported components, it is difficult to ship a commercial-grade, working machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Commercialization and Performance Gaps

As of August 2021, SMEE systems are primarily for 90 nanometer, 110 nanometer, and 280 nanometer processes, used for back-end [[challenges_in_semiconductor_lithography | lithography]], LED, MEMS, and power devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The majority of SMEE's systems use eyeline and krypton fluoride lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

Their most advanced system, the SSA 600-20 scanner for front-end manufacturing at the 90 nanometer node, uses an argon fluoride laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   A prototype (600-10) profiled in 2011 could process about 50 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   Comparable Canon and Nikon machines can do up to five times that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   As of 2019, the 600-20 iteration was estimated not to be selling in relevant quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   SMEE's recent sales are still in the outdated eyeline [[challenges_in_semiconductor_lithography | lithography]] machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

SMEE is developing an argon fluoride immersion (ArF-e) system, said to be capable of the 28 nanometer process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   This 28 nanometer tool is currently a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. China has a history of building prototypes that lag the leading edge by about 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. The 28 nanometer node first shipped around 2011, fitting this pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   The primary issue is moving from prototype to high-volume commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. China has historically struggled to turn prototypes into commercially competitive products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   The goal is to deliver commercial-ready 28 nanometer ArF-e machines in 2021 or 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. However, this deadline is likely to be missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, as Beijing Guowang's critical optics foundry is not expected to be completed until September 2023, making even a 2024 ship date ambitious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   Even then, the product is not expected to be commercially competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

An example of overhyped prototypes: In November 2018, the Institute of Opto-Electronics Technology announced a 22 nanometer "super resolution" [[challenges_in_semiconductor_lithography | lithography]] tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. CCTV claimed that with multi-patterning, sub-10 nanometer nodes could be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. However, the tool was not commercially ready, had low accuracy, and a tiny field of view (a few square millimeters), meaning it would take an extremely long time to process one wafer layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. In contrast, [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]]'s comparable DUV machine (Twinscan NXT 1970Ci) has a field of view of 858 square millimeters and can process over 250 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

## Human Capital and Working Culture

A significant challenge lies in human capital acquisition and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   While SMEE's average PhD salary is similar to [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]]'s company-wide average, there is a significant pay gap at higher levels and in overall benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] offers substantial benefits like share purchase plans, pension plans, commuting allowance, and 40 days of paid leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   SMEE, lacking [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]]'s capital base (Europe's most valuable tech company at $300 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, cannot be as generous with benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

SMEE has adopted Huawei's working practices due to its status as a national champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This means:
*   Long working hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   Considerable political intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
*   Tough annual assessments for bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   A "Jack Welch style" bottom five to ten percent layoff each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
This approach is likely to make it difficult for SMEE to acquire and retain top talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, unlike [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] which focuses on developing its people and reducing turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

## Unrealistic Optimism and Reality

Chinese press coverage of SMEE often uses steadfast cheerleading and "rah-rah optimism," referring to the photolithography effort as "the Mount Everest of the intelligent manufacturing industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Such strong rhetoric, like "there is nothing that can't be done by us Chinese," is counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

The reality is that SMEE is at least 20 years behind [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] in bringing a commercial-ready upper-class [[challenges_in_semiconductor_lithography | lithography]] device to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Immersion [[challenges_in_semiconductor_lithography | lithography]] is nascent, and [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV lithography technology and its challenges]] is even farther away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. This reality is acknowledged even by Chinese sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Overly optimistic claims lead to pessimism when deadlines are missed and prevent a realistic assessment of the problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

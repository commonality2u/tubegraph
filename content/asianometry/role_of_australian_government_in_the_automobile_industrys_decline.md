Australia's once-thriving automobile industry, which at one point employed 100,000 people and produced tens of thousands of vehicles for both domestic use and export, has largely vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The last major factory, operated by Toyota, closed in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, leaving only a few units produced for national security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The [[rise_and_fall_of_australian_automobile_industry | rise and fall of this industry]] can be attributed to a complex interplay of market forces, global economic shifts, and significant government policies.

### Post-World War II: Nurturing a Domestic Industry
Emerging from World War II, the Australian government actively sought to rebuild its economy and foster manufacturing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Car manufacturing was designated a high-priority sector, with the government offering subsidies and tax concessions to encourage foreign companies to establish production within Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This strategy attracted major foreign manufacturers such as Volkswagen, British Motors Leyland, and Ford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

A notable success of this period was GM-Holden, an Australian subsidiary of an American automaker, which produced the first "all-Australian car" in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Manufactured in Melbourne, the Holden was renowned for its ruggedness, suiting Australia's rural areas, and quickly dominated the market throughout the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

This [[economic_and_policy_factors_affecting_car_production_in_australia | domestic manufacturing industry]] thrived within a protected market environment, characterized by high tariffs that ensured demand for local employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. These employers, in turn, could afford to pay a "fair and reasonable basic wage," supported by powerful trade unions and a unique compulsory arbitration system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### The Whitlam Government and Tariff Reforms (1970s)
By the early 1970s, the automotive industry employed over 100,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. However, it began to suffer from a substantial loss of competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Australian automakers produced too many models with small production runs (as small as 25,000 units), lacking economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Furthermore, their focus on rugged rural cars diverged from the majority of the population who lived in cities, creating a market gap for small cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This allowed high-quality, low-cost Japanese imports, such as the Datsun, to gain a significant foothold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

The election of the Whitlam government in 1972 marked a turning point. As the first Australian Labor Party leader in 32 years, his administration was not favorably inclined towards the [[impact_of_foreign_multinationals_on_australian_car_manufacturing | foreign multinational-owned car makers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. By early 1973, with strong demand and concerns about rising inflation, the government, having already strengthened the Australian currency, sought further measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. They believed that a more liberal trade policy would provide a competitive "jolt" to the slow-to-reform domestic industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This policy aimed to expand international trade, cementing a reorientation towards Japan, which, along with other developing countries, was heavily importing Australian minerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

The most controversial part of this plan was an abrupt 25% reduction in all tariffs on imported goods in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This confrontational tactic led to industry backlash, with GM-Holden firing 5,000 workers and sparking a political crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. While import quotas were reimposed in 1974-1975 to stem losses due to worsening economic conditions (OPEC oil embargo, collapse of Bretton Woods), the initial abruptness of the reforms was criticized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. A key missing element was a government entity, akin to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), to coordinate the industry's transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Deregulation and Export Focus (1980s)
The mid-1980s brought a new government and significant macroeconomic policy changes, including banking sector deregulation, financial market liberalization, and floating the Australian dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The intent was to reorient domestic manufacturing towards exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Prime Minister Hawke criticized past tariffs for fostering "inefficient industries that could not compete overseas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

A "new car plan," introduced in late 1983 by Senator John Button, aimed to restructure the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. It offered credits and subsidies for Australian-made cars, along with temporary targeted procurement support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. However, it also rapidly reduced import tariffs from 57.5% to 45% by 1988, with further reductions planned until 2000, and removed import quotas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. The goal was to create a leaner, more competitive domestic industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

The "shrinking part" of the plan materialized as expected, with plant closures by all domestic automakers throughout the 1980s and 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Foreign companies, who had primarily entered the Australian market to bypass trade protections, saw little reason to maintain expensive manufacturing operations once those protections vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

### Subsidies and Economic Shifts (2000s)
Despite domestic assembly operations stabilizing at around 350,000 units annually in the 1990s and early 2000s, their market share continued to shrink due to Australia's economic and population growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This occurred despite significant government support, including AUD 500 million annually through a duty remission scheme, and the Automotive Competitive and Investment Scheme (ACIS), which cost the government AUD 7 billion from 2001 to 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

The early 2000s also saw the start of a decades-long mining boom, primarily fueled by demand from China and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. While promising "mining-led prosperity," this boom caused a dramatic appreciation of the Australian dollar, which doubled in value from 50 cents USD in 2001 to parity within 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. A stronger currency, while seemingly beneficial, dramatically increased the cost of Australian automotive production, leading to chronic losses for the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

The industry lost 25,000 jobs between 2003 and 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. When Mitsubishi announced the closure of its engine and assembly plants in Adelaide in 2004, resulting in 1,167 job losses, the federal government intervened with AUD 40 million for the region and AUD 10 million to help retrenched workers, supplemented by AUD 5 million from the South Australian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. However, these funds were often spread thin or misdirected, and studies showed that by 2005, each domestically produced Mitsubishi car was already receiving AUD 1,300 in subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. The Mitsubishi closure in 2006 signaled the beginning of the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

During the Global Financial Crisis, the Australian government introduced further [[government_intervention_in_technology_industries | industry interventions]], including the Green Car Innovation Fund and the Automotive Transformation Scheme, which subsidized automotive investment and research, particularly in energy efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. A AUD 200 million line of credit was also extended to GM-Holden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

### Final Decline (2010s)
The election of the conservative Abbott government in 2013 marked a philosophical shift, with the new administration disagreeing with previous [[government_policies_and_international_partnerships_in_australias_lng_market | government interventions]] in the automaking industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>, asserting that "the government's role is not to prop up private business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. They questioned why cars should receive preferential treatment when other manufacturing sectors were also struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.

By this time, the industry was a shadow of its former self. Modern car manufacturers aim for 250,000 cars per factory per year, but GM-Holden managed only 160,000 in the early 2000s, Mitsubishi struggled at 35,000, and Ford at 70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. Australian labor costs were significantly higher than those in emerging low-cost manufacturing hubs like China and Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. While Australian labor unions eventually became more collaborative, it was not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

Ultimately, consistent government support was deemed more crucial than labor relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. However, the perception was that the domestic industry had absorbed billions in subsidies with little to show for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Finance Minister Joe Hockey's blunt dismissal of GM's approaches – "either you're here or you're not" – combined with constant delays and uncertainty regarding future government policies, contributed to the decision by Toyota and GM to pull out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

### Conclusion: Lessons Learned
The [[comparison_of_australian_and_international_automobile_industries | demise of Australia's domestic auto industry]] had wide-ranging consequences, including the collapse of the local components industry and the vanishing of automotive R&D spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. While the government poured billions into the industry, the economics and economies of scale were ultimately not there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

A common point of discussion is the contrast with countries like Canada, which maintained an auto industry despite similar labor costs and a strong currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. Canada's factories were far more productive (three times higher average output than Australia's), and the Canadian government actively consolidated its auto industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>. The lack of a coordinating government entity, like Japan's MITI, which in the 1960s arranged mergers to create national champions like Toyota and Nissan, is often cited as a missed opportunity for Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. Had the Australian government forcibly intervened to merge the five domestic OEMs into one and invested a controlling share, the industry might still be alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

While the story of the Australian auto industry's decline has no single villain, it highlights the challenges faced by an island nation with high costs and a remote location in competing in a globalized market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Nevertheless, Australia is now focusing on new opportunities, with former auto factories like Toyota's Altona plant being converted into hubs for green hydrogen technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

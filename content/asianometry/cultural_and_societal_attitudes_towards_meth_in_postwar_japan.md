In the initial years following World War II, Japan experienced a significant crisis regarding [[japans_postwar_methamphetamine_crisis | methamphetamine]] abuse, which profoundly altered the country's perception of such drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Despite widespread addiction and related societal issues, public and official attitudes towards the drug were initially characterized by a lack of awareness regarding its dangers and a belief in its utility for productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## Initial Perceptions and Widespread Use

Prior to and during the war, methamphetamine was not widely recognized as a hazardous substance. It was first used as a cough suppressant or bronchodilator and occasionally for depression, but was not popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

During [[role_of_methamphetamine_in_world_war_ii_japan | World War II]], the drug, particularly the popular brand "philopon" or "hedopon," was marketed as "Awakening drugs" or "wakeamines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Advertisements promoted it for "night work and other times demanding mental alertness" and "over exertion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The Japanese military widely adopted it for the war effort, providing it to sentries, munitions factory workers, and even Kamikaze special forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

After the war, many soldiers took their pills home, largely ignorant of the drug's hazardous side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Pharmaceutical companies, believing they were helping the Japanese people rebuild and overcome tiredness, also dumped their huge postwar supplies into the civilian market, advertising heavily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Methamphetamine was often cheaper than alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

In 1948, it was estimated that 5% of Japanese males aged 16-25 were addicted to methamphetamine, and another survey found 30% of people aged 20-22 had tried or were taking stimulants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Despite this, contemporary documents often reflected a belief in the drug's positive upsides for working attitudes and stamina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. An editorial in the *Journal of the Japan Medical Association* highlighted how many journalists regularly used it, excusing it as a necessity for work productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

Initially, blame for drug abuse fell on "immoral people" like entertainers and novelists, rather than the drug itself. "Moral people," such as office workers, were seen as capable of using the drug "healthily" without negative issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Shifting Public Attitudes

Several events helped shift public attitudes against stimulants:

*   **Public Deaths** In October 1946, comedian Miss Wakana died of a heart attack, and in January 1947, novelist Sakonosuke Oda died of a hemorrhage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. While their deaths were likely not directly due to meth overdose (Wakana was clean, Oda likely died from tuberculosis), newspapers seized on their known drug habits, attributing their deaths to abuse and turning public sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **National Diet Debates** In 1949, discussions in the National Diet began focusing on street orphans whose parents were addicted to meth and who committed crimes to fund their own habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This led to the conclusion that the root cause was adult dealers and smugglers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Urawa City Incident** In October 1950, around 100 young people in Urawa City were arrested in connection to a mass sexual assault incident, with many perpetrators suffering hallucinations and delusions linked to a meth drug called "neo-agotine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This event made people realize "better controls were necessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Kyoko Hasada Murder** In April 1954, the rape and murder of primary school girl Kyoko Hasada by a 20-year-old meth addict named Shikichi Sakamaki, who claimed "hitopon" led him to do it, truly galvanized the nation's attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This sparked an "avalanche of meth related headlines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, with the media linking numerous other violent crimes to meth use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

The media and commentators played a significant role in whipping up public panic, describing the period as one of "moral decay" or "moral insanity" in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

## Public Awareness Campaigns and Blame Distribution

The escalating crisis prompted a strong [[public_health_response_and_legal_measures_against_meth | public health response and legal measures against meth]]. The police launched extensive awareness campaigns, spending over 24 million yen on posters, pamphlets, and leaflets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. These materials ranged from optimistic calls to "Wipe Out the evil of stimulant drugs" to shocking images of syringes plunged into teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Special focus was placed on young students, with lectures and discussions held in schools, factories, workplaces, and nightclubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. By 1955, a survey found that only 3% of youths had never heard of "hiropod" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

A nationalist narrative emerged, blaming the epidemic on "bad forces abroad," specifically "foreign Korean and Taiwanese populations," euphemistically called "Third Country residents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This narrative helped shift public attitudes against methamphetamine use by painting it as a "threat to Japan's future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. The Tokyo Police claimed 70% of illegal meth labs were run by Koreans, despite specifically targeting Korean villages for raids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. This dubious data exacerbated discrimination and violence against these beleaguered ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

By 1962, the "heropon Panic" had largely subsided, with offenses and arrests declining significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. The end of the crisis was attributed to a combination of factors: addressing the abundant legal and illegal supply of the drug, increasing public awareness about its addictiveness, and an alleviation of the terrible economic conditions that had initially contributed to its widespread use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. However, many young people simply switched to sniffing solvents, indicating that underlying issues of substance abuse persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

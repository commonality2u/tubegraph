Despite being the world's leading exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), [[australias_role_as_a_leading_lng_exporter|Australia]] occasionally experiences natural gas shortages within its own domestic markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This paradox highlights the country's vast size, abundant natural resources, and complex energy politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Causes of Domestic Shortages

### Uneven Distribution of Reserves
[[historical_development_of_natural_gas_in_australia|Australia]] holds significant proven natural gas reserves, estimated at about 3 trillion cubic meters in conventional reserves, potentially reaching 12 trillion cubic meters if unconventional fields like coal seam gas and shale gas are included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. However, much of this gas is unevenly distributed, with almost 80 percent of conventional gas resources concentrated in the country's northwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Lack of Integrated Pipeline System
A critical factor contributing to domestic shortages is [[transportation_and_infrastructure_issues_related_to_natural_gas_in_australia|Australia's]] lack of an integrated nationwide gas pipeline system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. The existing 47,000-kilometer network comprises three largely separate subsystems: the northern, western, and eastern markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Each market relies on its own local natural gas fields and separate pipeline systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This patchwork system stems from physical distances and varying regulatory regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

The practical impact is that [[australias_role_as_a_leading_lng_exporter|Australia]] struggles to transport natural gas from regions where it is abundant (like the northwest) to areas where it is most urgently needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. For example, it's roughly 3,202 miles from Dampier in Western [[historical_development_of_natural_gas_in_australia|Australia]] to Sydney, a distance longer than between Los Angeles and New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Such distances make it uneconomical for private entities to build a connecting pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Historical Export Policies
In 1970, [[historical_development_of_natural_gas_in_australia|Australia's]] federal government imposed a general export embargo on liquefied natural gas to ensure domestic requirements were met first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. However, this ban was lifted in 1977 for projects like the Northwest Shelf Venture, with the government allowing exports of "reasonable quantities of gas" only after domestic needs were considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. While the Northwest Shelf Project legally reserves a significant portion of its production for domestic use in Western [[historical_development_of_natural_gas_in_australia|Australia]] (providing 64% of the state's energy needs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, the eastern markets continue to face supply challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

### Rapid Growth in Domestic Energy Demand
[[economic_and_renewable_energy_implications_for_australia_and_southeast_asia|Australia's]] energy demand at home is growing rapidly, with consumption increasing by about 0.6 percent annually, driven by increased industrial demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Despite being the 55th largest country by population, [[australias_role_as_a_leading_lng_exporter|Australia's]] electricity consumption per capita ranks 19th globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This growth incentivized new developments in unconventional natural gas, particularly coal seam gas in the eastern regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. However, the decision to allow these eastern coal seam gas fields to also export LNG to [[impact_of_international_markets_on_australias_natural_gas_production|Asian markets]] added to domestic supply pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

## Impacts and Proposed Solutions
The lack of an integrated pipeline system contributes to a significant national energy security problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. As [[australias_role_as_a_leading_lng_exporter|Australia's]] natural gas exports are increasingly needed globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, its domestic markets face significant energy shortages and rising prices, impeding growth and causing political awkwardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

Ideas to address this dilemma include:
*   A transcontinental pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>
*   A nationwide gas reservation policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>

A comprehensive national strategy incorporating these and other ideas is needed to fix [[australias_role_as_a_leading_lng_exporter|Australia's]] natural gas dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

Reservoir silting is a significant global concern, leading to a loss of 1% to 2% of the world's hydropower capacity each year due to river silt and sediment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This process slowly erodes a dam's ability to store drinking water, generate power, and protect from flooding, necessitating costly preventive measures and interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Many reservoirs worldwide face this constant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

When a river is dammed, its normal flow of sediment transport is interrupted, causing sediments to settle within the reservoir, eventually filling it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This accumulation of sediment reduces the reservoir's water-carrying capacity, a situation known as reservoir sedimentation or silting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Storage lost to silting is termed "dead storage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Types of Sediment

Rivers carry two types of sediment:
*   **Coarse sediment** Sands and gravels, typically originating from the riverbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Fine-grained sediment** Smaller particles, about two millimeters wide, which can come from the riverbed or from clay and silt washed into the river by rains or human activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The total amount of sediment carried by rivers is measured using a metric called sediment yield, expressed in units like tons per year per square kilometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The single most significant cause for high sediment yields is upstream soil erosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Geographical Factors

While silting affects every reservoir eventually, certain geographical and climatic conditions exacerbate the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Taiwan
Taiwan's reservoirs are particularly impacted by silting due to its unique geography and weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>:
*   **Mountainous Terrain & Loose Soils** Taiwan is heavily mountainous with many loose soils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Typhoon Storms** The island experiences frequent typhoon storms with long rainstorms that can last for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. These intense rains sweep loose soils into rivers, significantly driving up sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

For example, Typhoon Morakot in 2009 deposited an estimated 90 million cubic meters of sediment into Taiwan's largest reservoir, the Zengwen Reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Australia
Australia, whose economy relies heavily on surface irrigation from dams and reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, also experienced severe siltation issues. Initially, engineers underestimated Australia's sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, leading to over 20 dams becoming fully silted between 1890 and 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

The highest rates of siltation occurred during large floods that followed significant droughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Dams were often ill-equipped to handle the massive influx of muddy floodwaters during these events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Human Activity and Soil Erosion
Soil erosion, a primary contributor to high sediment yields, is often exacerbated by human activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. When prime farmlands are exhausted, farmers may deforest and cultivate soils on sloping lands, making these areas extremely vulnerable to rain and subsequent erosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

The challenge in managing sediment yield reduction is the sheer size of watershed areas, which can span hundreds of miles under different governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Despite these challenges, hard work pays off, as evidenced by Australia's decline in siltation rates after the 1950s due to new farming techniques and land conservation methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

# [[effects_of_silt_and_sediment_on_reservoirs | Consequences of Silting]]

Beyond the reduction in water storage and hydropower generation, other consequences of silting include:
*   **Navigation Obstruction** Silted reservoirs make it difficult for boats to carry cargo, as piled-up sediment prevents access to dam locks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Air Quality and Health Hazards** When sediment dries, it can become airborne, causing dust storms and posing health hazards to local residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Damage to Hydropower Infrastructure** Coarse sediments can erode turbine runner blades, abrade gate seals and spillways, and clog intake valves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. For example, Hurricane David in 1979 blocked the Valdezia dam in the Dominican Republic with 17 meters of sediment and debris, blocking power intakes for half a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

# [[methods_for_managing_reservoir_siltation | Dealing with Reservoir Silting]]

Strategies to manage reservoir siltation fall into three categories:
1.  **Sediment Yield Reduction** Reducing the amount of sediment flowing into reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
2.  **Sediment Routing** Moving sediment around or through the reservoir to prevent accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
3.  **Sediment Removal** Removing accumulated sediment using hydraulic or mechanical techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Dams are critical pieces of [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources | infrastructure]] and require continuous effort to maintain their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Historically, reservoirs were designed with a working life, after which they were presumed lost to siltation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. However, societies cannot simply abandon these vital structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, as highlighted by the [[consequences_of_ignoring_reservoir_maintenance | consequences of ignoring reservoir maintenance]] seen in abandoned silted reservoirs like the 1,800-year-old Roman-built Harbaka Dam in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Recent discussions in Taiwan, particularly following local elections and the impending startup of TSMC's Arizona facility in 2024, have circulated a narrative suggesting that America is attempting to "steal" TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This concern stems from the company's expanding global footprint, which marks a departure from its long-standing operational norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## TSMC's Global Expansion

TSMC has been developing a new production facility in Arizona since May 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Initially, this facility was planned to produce N5 chips, an advanced node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Taiwanese observers found comfort in the Arizona site's relatively small scale, producing about 20,000 300mm wafers per month compared to Taiwan's four gigafabs, which produce over 100,000 wafers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. They also noted that N5 would not be the leading edge by the time the factory went online, expecting N3 to be active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

However, new announcements made shortly before the December 2022 tool-in ceremony revealed an expanded strategy:
*   **Arizona Fab 1**: Will now bring the N4 process (an upgrade on N5) to Arizona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Arizona Fab 2**: TSMC plans to invest an additional $28 billion over three years to open a second Arizona factory, which will be equipped with N3 technology and is expected to be in high-volume production by 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Other International Plans**: TSMC is also constructing a specialty n28 plant in Kumamoto prefecture, Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, and discussions are ongoing for a potential plant in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Despite these expansions, TSMC remains committed to keeping its most advanced nodes (N2 and N1, planned for 2026) in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

Historically, TSMC leaders, including Morris Chang, have emphasized that the company's success relies on conducting all, especially its most advanced, operations in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Drivers for Overseas Investment

The primary drivers for TSMC's expansion abroad are customer demand and financial incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Apple, which accounts for about 25% of TSMC's total revenue, is a significant customer influencing advanced chip rollouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated the company's decision to source from the Arizona plant starting in 2024 and potentially from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. TSMC is motivated to follow customer demand to avoid the risk of major clients like Apple returning to competitors such as Samsung or Intel, both of whom are also building large facilities in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Furthermore, the U.S. CHIPS Act of 2022 provides $50 billion in subsidies, which strategically incentivizes TSMC to build in the U.S., potentially reducing funds available to competitors like Intel and Samsung for their domestic expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Debunking the "Stealing" Narrative

The accusation of "stealing" TSMC or its technology is largely unfounded when examined through the lens of [[national_security_concerns_related_to_semiconductor_technology_transfer | technology transfer]] and economic scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Absence of Formal Technology Transfer Mechanisms
[[national_security_concerns_related_to_semiconductor_technology_transfer | Technology transfer]] situations typically involve joint ventures where foreign companies must partner with indigenous firms, include specific requirements for local content, and mandate explicit knowledge transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. TSMC's Arizona operation does not involve a joint venture; with the exception of one Fab in Singapore, TSMC has always owned its fabs outright, even when expanding to mainland China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The establishment of an Arizona fab does not fundamentally alter the inherent risk of high-level executives leaving to start new companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Economic Scale and Continued Investment in Taiwan
Claims of a "massive loss" to the Taiwanese economy are not supported by the scale of investment:
*   **Capital Expenditure**: TSMC's projected annual capital expenditure is around $36 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The $28 billion investment in the second Arizona Fab spread over three years equates to about $9 billion annually, representing 25-30% of the proposed annual capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The majority of the company's spending will continue to be in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Wafer Shipments**: In 2021, TSMC produced and shipped 14.2 million 300mm equivalent wafers, with an estimated 75-85% produced in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. When the Arizona Fab starts production in 2024, it will produce around 20,000 300mm equivalent wafers per month, which is less than 1/50th of current annual production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Even with planned expansion to 50,000 wafers a month by 2026, it would require five to ten times more investment and subsidies to significantly shift production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

TSMC is simultaneously juggling at least five other build-outs and expansions in Taiwan, including new phases for existing fabs in Tainan, new N2 plants in Baoshan and potentially Taichung, future plans for an N1 plant in Longtan District, and an N28 build in Kaohsiung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This demonstrates TSMC's continued commitment to its operations in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Broader Economic and Supply Chain Implications

The idea that the Arizona Fab makes America self-sufficient in silicon overlooks critical aspects of the global semiconductor supply chain:

*   **Chip Types**: The majority of industrially important semiconductors (used in fridges, airplanes, cars) are not the leading-edge N4 and N3 chips produced by the Arizona Fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Instead, they are older nodes (e.g., 130nm, 65nm, n28) which, while high in volume, are low in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Other Taiwanese Foundries**: Taiwan hosts other significant semiconductor foundries like UMC (3rd largest), Powerchip (7th), and Vanguard (8th), each with specialty processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Packaging, Assembly, and Testing (OSAT)**: Taiwan holds leading positions in the rest of the chip supply chain, including wafers, packaging, assembly, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. America's share in global packaging, assembly, and test capacity is only 3%, significantly lower than its 10% fabrication market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Taiwan is home to three of the world's five largest outsourced semiconductor packaging, assembly, and testing companies, including the largest, ASE Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. There is no U.S. government funding or Arizona Fab equivalent for conventional packaging, indicating a lack of effort in this crucial area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Human Capital**: The managers running the fabs, including thousands of difficult-to-replace R&D, operations, and supply chain management personnel, are predominantly in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

Taiwan's leadership in semiconductor manufacturing, electronics assembly, and specialty plastics is the result of billions of dollars and 50 years of industrial development, which cannot be replicated quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## Conclusion

The notion of America "stealing" TSMC is largely a misrepresentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Taiwan remains TSMC's greatest asset, and the company is compelled to go "all in" on its home base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The ongoing expansion in Arizona does not fundamentally change the global supply chain dynamics or Taiwan's indispensable role within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The China-Taiwan scenario represents a systemic risk that transcends individual companies or sectors, and its repercussions cannot be easily hedged against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. For the broader Taiwanese population, the current status quo has been beneficial, and its continuation is hoped for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

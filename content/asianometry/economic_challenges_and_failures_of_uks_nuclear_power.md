The story of nuclear power in the United Kingdom is characterized by [[economic_transition_and_potential_of_renewable_energy_in_northeast_england | bad economics]] and missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Despite being a nuclear pioneer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, a series of [[technological_decisions_and_their_impacts_on_british_nuclear_program | poor technical decisions]] led the industry down an uneconomical path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Early Optimism and Government Control
In October 1952, the United Kingdom became the third country to explode an atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This monumental achievement, largely accomplished without American cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, fostered optimism that nuclear development could benefit mankind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Scientists believed civilian nuclear energy could revolutionize Britain's energy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, especially since the country relied almost entirely on indigenous coal mines for power and heating, and finding coal miners was becoming difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

In 1953, Winston Churchill announced a new public agency to manage all of the country's nuclear development efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. A year later, the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The UKAEA held a monopoly on nuclear R&D and served as the de facto source of nuclear information for political classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, contrasting with the United States where private entities participated in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## The Magnox Program: First Generation Reactors
### Origins and Expansion
Early reactors in the UK were built primarily for military needs, producing plutonium and other radioactive materials, rather than for economically generating power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. In 1954, the UKAEA drafted a plan to build a series of nuclear power stations to generate approximately 1,700 megawatts by 1965, based on the design of the Calder Hall power station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Queen Elizabeth II commissioned Calder Hall in October 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

The Suez Canal Crisis in 1956, a diplomatic blunder for Britain, cast uncertainty on global oil supplies and spurred the incoming Harold Macmillan administration to emphasize energy independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This political environment led the UKAEA to expand its nuclear power program to 5,000-6,000 megawatts, or about 19 stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This expansion was estimated to cost about 750 million British pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a> and was projected to provide a quarter of the country's energy needs by 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

These reactors used a Magnox design, standing for magnesium non-oxidizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The Magnox was based on Calder Hall's gas-cooled, graphite-moderated reactor design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, considered a first-generation reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Economic Uncompetitiveness and Challenges
The decision to use air-cooled graphite reactors for military purposes had far-reaching consequences for the civilian nuclear power industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. While potentially safer, gas-cooled and heavy water reactors have lower power output for their size compared to light water reactors, leading to lower thermal efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

In 1957, the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) was created to control electricity generation and the national grid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The CEGB began to push back against the UKAEA's nuclear rollout, pointing out nuclear's economic uncompetitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The effects of the Suez Crisis on oil prices did not last, with new oil fields discovered and cheaper transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Nuclear power became harder to advocate for when coal and oil were getting cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Even with optimistic estimates, nuclear costs were 25% higher than coal, rising to 40% in areas with cheap coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

Pressures from the CEGB and the Treasury forced the government to dial down the Magnox program and push back its deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. In total, 26 stations were started between 1962 and 1971, producing about 4,200 megawatts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

The Magnox rollout overran early estimates by 10-20% in cost and took 40% longer than planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This was due to rushing the plan into action, as Calder Hall had only recently started operating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Builders did not fully understand the design before scaling up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Lack of Standardization
The UK used five different consortiums to build the power plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, resulting in each station being unique without standardization. This prevented [[challenges_faced_by_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_england | efficiencies of scale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. For example, while Berkeley Power Station was closest to Calder Hall, changes were made to add on-load refueling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Sizewell and Bradwell added more boilers and raised coolant pressure to improve thermal efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, and Oldbury added a concrete pressure vessel requiring substantial re-engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Financial Burdens
Rising interest rates significantly impacted nuclear power plant construction, which is capital-intensive and takes a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Initial assumptions of a 6% interest rate (later 10%) were too low, compared to 14% estimates in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Capital costs alone added 360 million British pounds to seven nuclear stations built between 1962 and 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. These higher costs were passed directly to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Electricity generation prices for the Berkeley and Bradwell plants rose from 150 pounds per kilowatt to 160 pounds even before construction began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

The gas-cooled design was originally from the British military, better suited for plutonium production than economic power generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. While the UKAEA argued this was a feature, allowing them to sell plutonium to the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, new supplies from Canada and the US crashed the plutonium market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## The Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) Program: Second Generation
### Flawed Selection Process
As the Magnox program wound down, the UK government launched a second-generation nuclear program in April 1964, proposing another 5,000 megawatts of nuclear plants for 1970-1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. The CEGB was tasked with deciding between continuing with gas-cooled Magnox-style reactors or adopting an American light water design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. The UKAEA advocated for its gas-cooled design, wanting to export British native reactor designs abroad, but the international community was favoring American water-cooled designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

Despite initial skepticism from the CEGB, especially after the retirement of nuclear power skeptic Sir Christopher Hinton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, the CEGB chose a tender from Atomic Power Constructions (APC) for the Dungeness B plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. APC was near bankrupt and had briefly evaluated doubling the rods from the original gas-cooled design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. The UKAEA and CEGB claimed the gas-cooled Dungeness plant would produce energy for 7% less than competing American designs "under British conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. In May 1965, the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) was officially recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

### Design Flaws and Immense Costs
The AGR proved to be the wrong choice, based on unrealistic assumptions and models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. APC, which had stretched beyond its capabilities, collapsed in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

The "British conditions" argument was based on faulty assumptions:
*   **Capital Costs:** Again, capital cost estimates were too low compared to American projects, despite using a less proven design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **On-Load Refueling:** The assumption that AGRs could run for more days due to on-load refueling was faulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. This had only worked on a small prototype (33 megawatts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, and when attempted on a full-sized AGR, the reactor vibrated so much that three fuel elements broke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. It took over 20 years to fully achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

By 1967, it was clear the AGR design was not ready due to immense engineering challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. The AGR operated at higher temperatures for better thermal efficiency (about 40%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, but this corroded the magnesium cladding used around the fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Over 10 million pounds were spent testing alternatives like beryllium and stainless steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Additionally, graphite, used to moderate the reactor, cracked at high temperatures and radiation loads, requiring a new coolant circulation system to keep it cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

Dungeness B finally started generating power in 1983, 18 years after work began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, and did not reach full capacity until 2004, 38 years after its start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. This became a lasting symbol of the struggling nuclear industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Seven other AGR stations built later also suffered cost and time overruns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

An estimate published in 1977 by economist P.D. Henderson found the AGR debacle cost the country about 2.1 billion pounds in 1975 currency, which translates to about 20 billion pounds today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

## Market Competition and Privatization Efforts
The discovery of massive oil and gas fields off the North Sea presented new economic challenges to nuclear power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. The coal industry, despite shedding jobs, also became nuclear's biggest critic due to economic realism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. However, the oil crises of the 1970s and minor strikes reminded the British of the dangers of an energy mix without nuclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

In 1979, Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government came to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. She supported nuclear energy for its lack of greenhouse gas emissions and as a hedge against the coal industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. Initially, her administration believed nuclear-generated electricity was cheaper than other methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. In the early 1980s, the government announced plans for new pressurized water reactors, with Sizewell B as the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

By 1987, Thatcher promised to privatize the electricity supply industry while securing its nuclear future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. However, the UK's 11 completed nuclear plants (9 Magnoxes and 2 AGRs) and six ongoing construction projects were not economically competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. Oil prices had fallen, the coal workers' unions were weakened, and gas-fired power stations were gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. Sizewell B would not have passed an investment review by private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

Additionally, the nine first-generation Magnox reactors were nearing the end of their operating life, bringing immense decommissioning and waste disposal costs (about 600 million pounds for each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. No private shareholder would take on these liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

In late 1989, the entire nuclear portfolio was withdrawn from privatization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Two new companies, Nuclear Electric (for England and Wales) and Scottish Nuclear Limited (for Scotland), were created to manage the stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. While Sizewell B continued construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>, three other planned water-cooled reactors were cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. This withdrawal was a national humiliation, admitting that decades of favorable cost estimates were false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

## Recovery and Decline of Indigenous Industry
Over the next few years, the two state-owned nuclear companies improved their AGR reactors and introduced new management practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. They also shut down their oldest reactors and negotiated fixed prices for disposal with British Nuclear Fuels Limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. This removed uncertainty about future liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. By 1995, Scottish Nuclear made an operating profit of 182 million pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

In 1995, the government finally privatized the two companies, combining seven of their newer AGR nuclear power stations into British Energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>. The Magnox reactors were hived off into another company for future decommissioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. However, the government made it clear it would not support and subsidize further water-cooled plants after Sizewell B <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. This essentially marked the end of the indigenous nuclear power industry in the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

British Energy later suffered financial troubles in 2002, requiring a 650 million pound bailout by the British government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>, and was eventually acquired by a French power company and renamed EDF Energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

## Conclusion and Future Outlook
The UK's decision to stick with the gas-cooled reactor route, perhaps overvaluing its indigenous origin, wasted a time of nuclear optimism and crippled the industry for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. In contrast, France abandoned its gas-cooled designs and developed a thriving export business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.

Sizewell B remains the last completed nuclear power station in the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. After a long hiatus, the UK is looking to re-enter nuclear power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. In 2010, the government announced new third-generation nuclear power stations, with funding and technology from the Chinese state-owned enterprise China General Nuclear Power Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. The first of these, Hinkley Point C, is slated for completion in 2027 at a cost of 25 billion pounds, 50% higher than its original 2016 budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>. The historical challenge for the UK's nuclear energy industry has been its structural inability to compete with gas-fired and coal plants on the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

The invention of the transistor, which occurred on December 16, 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, was hailed as "The Game Changer" and the "foundation stone for all the technologies around us today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This discovery led to the [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | modern world of compute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> by overthrowing the [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | vacuum tube]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Initial Secrecy and Public Announcement
Following the successful demonstration of the first transistor to AT&T leadership, who could listen to amplified speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, AT&T kept the discovery a secret for several months to patent the design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. They also demonstrated it to the US military, who considered classifying it, potentially pondering another "underground" venture like the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Fortunately, due to the device's broad applications, it was not classified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, and the news was released to the public on June 30, 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The New York Times' first mention of the transistor, however, was notably understated, simply stating it had "applications in radio where a vacuum tube ordinarily is employed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Challenges with the Point-Contact Transistor
The announcement of the point-contact transistor sparked a massive global rush into the study of solid-state physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. While historically important, its discovery was largely accidental, and its underlying physics were not well understood at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. As a commercial product, the point-contact transistor "flopped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. [[Role of Bell Labs and key figures in transistor invention | Bell Labs]]' sister company, Western Electric, began major production in 1951, making 8,400 devices a month by 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. However, its performance was inconsistent due to its dependence on sensitive semiconductor surface structures, making it fragile and susceptible to humidity and temperature changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

## The Junction Transistor: A Commercial Success
[[Role of Bell Labs and key figures in transistor invention | William Shockley]], who was not involved in the point-contact transistor experiment, worked to develop a more robust and commercially viable device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. On January 23, 1948, he conceived the junction transistor, which addressed the fragility of the point-contact type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

The junction transistor's key innovation was "minority carrier injection," allowing charge carriers to flow through the entirety of the semiconducting material rather than just its surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. This made the device far more resilient and commercially useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. In 1950, [[Role of Bell Labs and key figures in transistor invention | Bell Labs]] chemists Gordon Teal and Morgan Sparks adopted the Czochralski process to grow pure germanium crystals that could be "doped" to create P-N junctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This led to the first "grown junction transistors" in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The junction transistor was a sturdy, three-part sandwich, superior to the fragile point-contact type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

## Licensing and Market Expansion
In 1949, a US Government antitrust lawsuit against AT&T resulted in a Consent Decree, requiring AT&T to license its discoveries, including the transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Various domestic and foreign companies could obtain a patent license for $25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. In September 1951, [[Role of Bell Labs and key figures in transistor invention | Bell Labs]] held its first symposium on transistor manufacturing, providing licensees with an 800-page book and samples, known as the "$25,000 book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

Existing [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | vacuum tube]] companies like RCA, General Electric, Westinghouse, and Sylvania recognized the threat and aggressively developed germanium transistor capacity, leading to new innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. Around 1951-1952, General Electric and RCA discovered the "alloy junction transistor," which was more scalable to manufacture than the grown junction type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

## Global Adoption and Early Products
The first transistorized products entered the market in 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. One notable early application was the transistorized hearing aid, which significantly shrank the device and revolutionized the experience for the hard-of-hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

News of the transistor spread rapidly, spurring countries worldwide to develop their own. France quickly created its competing "transistron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. Japan's Electrotechnical Laboratory produced its first point-contact transistor in 1951 and its first junction transistor in 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Japan's Sony Corporation went on to commercialize the transistor radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>, and researcher Leo Esaki later won the 1973 Nobel Prize for his work there on electron tunneling in semiconductor materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

## Impact on Computing
From its inception, the transistor was expected to integrate into computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. Replacing the thousands of [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | vacuum tubes]] in 1950s computers with transistors promised smaller, more energy-efficient, cooler, and more reliable devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.

In November 1953, the University of Manchester launched a computer with 92 first-generation point-contact transistors, generally considered the first transistorized computer (though it still included tubes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. [[Role of Bell Labs and key figures in transistor invention | Bell Labs]] and other companies, encouraged by the military, invested heavily in developing more reliable transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. The commercialization of improved alloy junction transistors and variants, such as Philco's "surface-barrier transistor," accelerated this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. In May 1954, the United States Air Force received the first American transistorized computer, TRADIC (TRAnsistor DIgital Computer), containing 700 transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. These transistorized computers marked a clear line in [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | generational shifts in semiconductor manufacturing]], becoming known as second-generation devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

By late 1954, [[Role of Bell Labs and key figures in transistor invention | William Shockley]] left [[Role of Bell Labs and key figures in transistor invention | Bell Labs]] to start his own business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. In 1955, [[Role of Bell Labs and key figures in transistor invention | Bell Labs]] held 37% of all transistor patents issued, but this share declined as former [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | vacuum tube]] companies aggressively entered the business, marking the end of [[Role of Bell Labs and key figures in transistor invention | Bell Labs]]' exclusive pioneering status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. The rapid [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | advancements in semiconductor technology]] and the global commercialization of the transistor had begun in earnest.

Moldova, a small Eastern European country, is one of Europe's [[moldovas_economic_struggles_postsoviet_union | poorest]] and most [[moldovas_political_and_economic_corruption | corrupt]] nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Over two decades, a pattern emerged where politicians enriched businessmen, who then became politicians themselves, ultimately seizing control of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This article examines how oligarchic wealth and power came to dominate Moldova's political and economic landscape.

## Post-Soviet Transition and Economic Vulnerability

After the collapse of the [[the_impact_of_soviet_rule_on_moldova | Soviet Union]], the Republic of Moldova faced daunting challenges, including a complete remaking of its identity, economy, and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The economy collapsed rapidly, with an average annual shrinkage of 7% and hyperinflation reaching 75% monthly in the first six months of 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. By late 1992, 79% of the population fell into [[moldovas_economic_struggles_postsoviet_union | poverty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

To stabilize the situation, the government announced a transition to a market economy by 1996, focusing on liberalizing trade and privatizing state property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. However, the execution of these reforms was flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>:
*   Shares in state-owned firms were distributed to workers and the public, but company managers exploited inside knowledge to buy shares at low prices or pilfer assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   Agricultural land distribution was also botched, with plots assigned without regard for quality or fertility, and connected individuals assembling massive parcels of fertile land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

These privatization schemes failed to achieve their goals, instead enriching a select group of connected individuals and creating a class of oligarchs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. By 1997, Moldova's GDP had fallen to 35% of its level a decade earlier, and over 50% of the population lived in [[moldovas_economic_struggles_postsoviet_union | poverty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## The Communist Party's Return and the Rise of Vladimir Plahotniuc

In 2001, the Communist Party of Moldova, led by Vladimir Voronin, surged back into power, promising free healthcare and closer ties with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. They consolidated rule using their disciplined organizational base inherited from the Soviet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. This period saw increased [[moldovas_political_and_economic_corruption | corruption]] and theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   Voronin's son, Oleg, headed a business empire and received lucrative government contracts, becoming arguably Moldova's first billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   Vladimir Voronin also developed close ties with businessman Vladimir Plahotniuc, who became one of his closest advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

Plahotniuc, whose background is difficult to trace, began exporting wine to Russia in 1996 and later became vice-chairman of Victoria Bank, one of Moldova's largest banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. By the end of the 2000s, Moldova had 70 billionaires, whose total wealth accounted for 138% of the reported GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Plahotniuc himself was worth an estimated $2 billion, making him the country's richest man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

When the Communists lost power in 2009 following protests (dubbed the "Twitter Revolution") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, Plahotniuc defected to the Democratic Party of Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Despite his sudden emergence, his immense wealth and control of media companies allowed him to quickly dominate the party and become one of Moldova's most powerful leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. This marked a shift where businessmen, having been enriched by politicians, now entered politics themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

## Plahotniuc's "Captured State"

For the next five years, Plahotniuc shared power with Vlad Filat, another Moldovan billionaire who had accumulated wealth through illegal trading and by buying state assets while serving as State Secretary for privatization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   Filat controlled financial regulators and the Ministry of Economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   Plahotniuc solidified control over the Judiciary and law enforcement, which proved to be a crucial weapon against his rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

Their alliance fractured following a scandal in December 2012 involving an illegal hunting trip where a bystander was killed and a cover-up attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Filat's attempt to remove the prosecutor general, a member of Plahotniuc's faction, led to a series of anti-corruption drives by Plahotniuc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

### The "Robbery of the Century"

In November 2014, an even bigger scandal, dubbed the "robbery of the century," came to light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Three Moldovan banks were taken over and forced to issue nearly $3 billion in bad loans, equivalent to 15% of the country's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. The money was laundered through shell companies to Latvian banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. When the loans defaulted, the banks collapsed, and the Moldovan National Central Bank secretly bailed them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. The Ministry of Finance had to issue $1 billion in 25-year bonds to cover this bailout, effectively burdening the Moldovan people for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. The Moldovan currency devalued by over 40%, causing inflation to explode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

The scheme was masterminded by Israeli-born Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. Shor was arrested and implicated, and in exchange for leniency, he implicated former Prime Minister Filat, who was stripped of immunity, arrested, and imprisoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

With Filat out of the way, Plahotniuc consolidated his power, becoming the richest and most powerful man in Moldova, with a fortune worth over 30% of the country's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. His network controlled state-owned companies, financial flows, and most of the country's TV stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. By the mid-to-late 2010s, Moldovans had lost trust in their government, with an 80% disapproval rating in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. Plahotniuc, despite his party being nominally pro-European, lacked a particular ideology and consistently worked to solidify his personal power, including reforming election policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

## The Fall of Plahotniuc

In February 2019, parliamentary elections resulted in a hung Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. Unexpectedly, the pro-European ACUM alliance and the pro-Russian Socialist Party formed a coalition to oust Plahotniuc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. This unusual alliance, backed by the EU, US, and Russia, formed a government in June 2019, with ACUM's Maia Sandu as prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

Plahotniuc resisted fiercely, cutting power to the Parliament building and having the Constitutional Court invalidate the new government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. However, unified international pressure forced the Constitutional Court to reverse its decision, acknowledging its bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. The Democratic Party conceded power, and Plahotniuc fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

Despite the oligarch's fall, Moldova remains a profoundly [[moldovas_economic_struggles_postsoviet_union | poor]] and [[moldovas_political_and_economic_corruption | corrupt]] society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. Decades of poorly executed policies and bad governance have left significant damage requiring substantial time and effort to reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

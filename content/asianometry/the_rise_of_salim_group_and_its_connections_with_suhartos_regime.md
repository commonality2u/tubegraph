At its peak, Indonesia's Salim Group was a $22 billion giant, the country's biggest business group, founded by Lim Sioe Liong (also known as Sudono Salim) who became Southeast Asia's richest man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The group's remarkable ascent was built on its personal connection to the authoritarian leader, Suharto, who was a personal friend of Lim and relied on the company as a core collaborator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Few companies dominated a single country as Salim's companies did Indonesia, until the [[impact_of_the_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | Asian financial crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Lim Sioe Liong's Early Life and Connections

Lim, born Lin Xiaolian, arrived on the shores of Java in 1938 at the age of 21, fleeing the fighting of the Second Sino-Japanese War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Though not penniless, he relied on a thriving network of family and ethnic clan members for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. At this time, Indonesia was a Dutch Colony with an economy focused on commodity exports and dominated by Dutch businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Lim became an [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_chinese_businesses_in_indonesia | ethnic Chinese]] trader, initially selling clothes and then starting a coffee grinding business with his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

During Japan's occupation (which ended in 1945), Lim survived by selling various goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. When the Dutch attempted to reimpose colonial rule, a nationalist movement led by Sukarno and Muhammad Hatta sparked a four-year struggle for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Lim launched a supplies business, smuggling essentials like soap, coffee, sugar, and rice to the Republican Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. He impressed the soldiers of one military unit, leading to his introduction to Suharto, a native Javanese and the unit's logistics officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Indonesia gained independence in December 1949, with Sukarno as its first president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Suharto's Rise and the "New Order"

The early years under Sukarno were challenging for foreign investors and the [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_chinese_businesses_in_indonesia | Chinese ethnic minority]] due to Sukarno's socialist leanings and suspicion of foreign capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. In 1958, Sukarno's government seized all Dutch assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Lim moved to Jakarta in 1952 due to racial discrimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. In 1956, Suharto was appointed commander of the local division in Semarang, where he and Lim rekindled their friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Lim became Suharto's go-to person for "money matters" due to his reliability, and Suharto, in turn, became Lim's patron and protector as he rose through the military ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

The late 1950s saw [[economic_and_political_dynamics_in_indonesia_during_suhartos_presidency | economic weakness and political turmoil]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Sukarno's anti-imperialist ideologies brought him closer to the Communists, but his focus on revolution neglected the economy, leading to hyperinflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This culminated in chaos between 1965 and 1966, marked by increasing tensions between the Communist Party of Indonesia and the Indonesian Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. An attempted coup on September 30, 1965, resulted in the kidnapping and killing of seven senior military officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Suharto then led a Western-backed counter-coup, which devolved into mass killings of hundreds of thousands of suspected Communists, [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_chinese_businesses_in_indonesia | ethnic Chinese]], and other leftists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

In March 1966, Sukarno transferred power to Suharto, who declared a "New Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This marked a 180-degree turn in internal and external policy, with Indonesia rejoining the United Nations and opening its economy to foreign capital and aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This development plan brought consistent [[economic_and_political_dynamics_in_indonesia_during_suhartos_presidency | economic growth]] throughout Suharto's reign, but also created new opportunities for corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## [[crony_capitalism_and_its_role_in_building_indonesias_largest_business_empire | Crony Capitalism]] and Salim Group's Early Monopolies

The military and business community in Indonesia were historically intertwined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Commanders partnered with local businessmen, known as "kukong" (Hokkian for Boss and often [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_chinese_businesses_in_indonesia | ethnic Chinese]]), who received favors and concessions for funneling cash to the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This relationship strengthened under Suharto, who crafted a [[crony_capitalism_and_its_role_in_building_indonesias_largest_business_empire | crony capitalist]] political pyramid that collected rents on a broad range of [[economic_and_political_dynamics_in_indonesia_during_suhartos_presidency | economic activities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Suharto's [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_chinese_businesses_in_indonesia | Chinese business partners]] relied on him for protection, as he carefully separated economic and [[political_influence_and_government_ties | political power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Lim, starting as one of Suharto's "Chinese kukong," quickly became the biggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
In 1966, the government granted Lim one of two exclusive licenses to import cloves, a critical ingredient for Indonesia's "kretek" cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Although Lim's company received a small percentage, the majority of profits went to a slush fund owned by the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This provided critical early funds for Lim to expand into more lucrative businesses like food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

In 1969, Lim partnered with Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok to found Bogasari Flour Mills, which quickly received a monopoly on the import, milling, and distribution of wheat for Western Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This became immensely profitable, with 25-35% profit margins, as Indonesians adopted wheat products like instant noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Again, 26% of the company's profits were designated to foundations headed by Suharto and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Salim Group's food business later expanded to form Indofood, a $7 billion conglomerate and one of the world's biggest instant noodle producers, controlling 90% of the Indonesian market throughout the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## Diversification and Growth

Salim Group distinguished itself by competently executing the government's development plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. An example is their entry into the cement industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Suharto directed Lim to build cement capacity with the help of Taiwan's Tuntex Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Propelled by Indonesia's 1970s oil export boom, Lim built one of the world's biggest cement companies, controlling 60% of Indonesia's total cement production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. When oil prices tumbled in 1984, Suharto bailed out Lim, ordering the government to purchase 35% of what is now PT Indocement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

By the end of the 1970s, Salim Group had grown from three companies in 1957 to 54 companies across six fields: trading, automobile manufacturing, property, construction, finance, and natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The group exploded in the mid-1980s, with over 225 Lim-affiliated businesses by 1986, generating nearly a billion dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. By 1989, another estimate counted 350 affiliated companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Many of these companies held monopolies or near-monopolies, such as Indomobile Group, one of Indonesia's biggest car manufacturers, and Indomaret, Indonesia's largest convenience store chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. Lim's empire was a complex network of separate companies, often controlled by him, his family, and partners, for tax reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### The Rise of Bank Central Asia (BCA)

One of Salim Group's most valuable businesses was its bank, Bank Central Asia (BCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Lim acquired a small knitting company with a banking license in the 1950s, which he renamed BCA and moved to Jakarta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Though some shares were distributed to Suharto's generals and children, BCA remained small until 1975 when Lim recruited banker Mukhtar Riady <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Riady, known for building up Panin Bank, became BCA's single biggest shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

Riady grew BCA by targeting customers of Lim's empire and overhauling the bank's systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. BCA computerized, linked branches, issued credit cards, cross-sold financial products, and installed hundreds of ATMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. In just three years, BCA became Indonesia's biggest private bank, with deposits soaring over a thousandfold from 1 billion Indonesian Rupiah in 1974 to 7.5 trillion Rupiah in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Riady eventually transitioned out to focus on his family's growing business, Lipo Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. BCA continued to grow, but banking reforms in 1989 increased competition, which would cause significant troubles later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

## Suharto's Declining Influence and Lim's Diversification Abroad

By the 1990s, Suharto, in his 70s, was becoming out of touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. His children gained [[political_influence_and_government_ties | political influence]], elbowing out trusted advisors, and their incompetence and self-interest began to turn public opinion against the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. An infamous example was Suharto's creation of a single clove monopoly for his youngest son, Tommy, in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Tommy's mismanagement drove the industry "into the ground," forcing Bank Indonesia to bail out the monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

Sensing a shift, Lim and his family began to diversify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. He had founded a small financial services company in Hong Kong called First Pacific in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Starting in the mid-1980s, Lim began building real estate and consumer businesses in Hong Kong, China, and Singapore through First Pacific, reducing reliance on his [[political_influence_and_government_ties | political relationships]] with Suharto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

## [[impact_of_the_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | The Asian Financial Crisis]] and Suharto's Fall

Indonesia's oil export boom dried out in 1985, leading to government reforms aimed at easing import and export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. While initially successful in shifting the economy away from oil, non-oil exports sputtered by 1994, partly due to investors pivoting to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. More reforms were passed, removing limits on foreign investment and opening new sectors, though protections remained for those dominated by Suharto's children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. This seemed to work, with GDP growth rebounding to about 8% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

During this period, Salim Group saw some of its greatest expansions across Asia, with its companies growing 40-50% a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. By 1995, the empire's total revenues were estimated at $9-11 billion, with independent analysts estimating 1996 revenues at $22.8 billion, constituting 4% of Indonesia's total GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. In 1997, Lim's net worth reached $4 billion, making him the world's 68th richest man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

However, this boom was built on short-term external debts, doubling from $70 billion in 1990 to $140 billion by mid-1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. Most of this debt was borrowed by the private sector, but Indonesia's banking system, including Salim's BCA, seemed strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

On July 2, 1997, Thailand free-floated its currency, starting a contagion that led to capital flight from Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. Bank Indonesia soon lacked reserves to defend the currency, leading to the Rupiah losing over 30% of its value by August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. This devaluation deeply affected Indonesian banks, as their foreign-denominated debt soared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. Many banks were insolvent due to intense competition and high non-performing loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. In October 1997, 16 commercial banks closed, leading to bank runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. A run on BCA, fueled by rumors, cost it $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

The IMF intervened with a $33 billion bailout package in October 1997, imposing stringent economic reform conditions, including disassembling state and private monopolies and cutting subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. These demands, which targeted Suharto's cronies and family, eventually led to his fall from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

In 1998, Indonesia's GDP contracted by 13%, with severe contractions in construction, financial, and manufacturing sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. Mass unemployment and skyrocketing living costs, exacerbated by an El Nino drought, fueled unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. The IMF's reforms attacked monopolies in various sectors, hitting Suharto's supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. Relations between the government and the IMF deteriorated, leading the fund to withhold payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

In May 1998, mass riots broke out in response to fuel subsidy cuts, often targeting [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_chinese_businesses_in_indonesia | ethnic Chinese]] and their businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. Amidst pro-democracy student demonstrations and cabinet abandonment, Suharto resigned on May 21, 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.

Lim, already largely relocated to Singapore, had his home attacked and set on fire during the riots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. His son, Anthony Salim, evacuated the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. BCA and other Salim companies suffered damage, but the real blow came after Suharto's fall when the bank's association with a government crony turned against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. A "titanic run" on BCA caused its collapse, forcing the central bank to take it over along with its $5 billion in debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

## Legacy and Conclusion

With a new political environment, the massive and insolvent Salim Empire began to break apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. Many of BCA's debts were owed by other Salim Group companies, threatening the entire group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. Amidst public fury, Anthony Salim negotiated a settlement, handing over stakes in over 100 Indonesian businesses, including Indocement and Indomobile, to repay the $5 billion government bailout for BCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. Crucially, Salim managed to retain a 50.1% share in Indofood, strategically moving those holdings offshore to the family's First Pacific financial company in Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. Indofood has since become one of the world's biggest food companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.

Lim never returned to Indonesia after 1998, dying peacefully in Singapore in 2012 at age 95, with an estimated net worth of $655 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. Lim was seen as the right person who made the right friends at the right time, outperforming other [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_chinese_businesses_in_indonesia | Chinese business partners]] of Suharto's circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. Suharto's governance brought substantial [[economic_and_political_dynamics_in_indonesia_during_suhartos_presidency | economic benefits]] to Indonesia, with 32 years of 7% annual economic growth and the development of agricultural and manufacturing bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. However, the dark side was whom it enriched: Suharto, his [[crony_capitalism_and_its_role_in_building_indonesias_largest_business_empire | cronies]], and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

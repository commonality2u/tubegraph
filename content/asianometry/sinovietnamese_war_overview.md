On the morning of February 17, 1979, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) commenced shelling the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, swiftly followed by 100,000 People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops crossing the border into Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These forces advanced in five columns through border areas, capturing several cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Initially, the attack seemed perplexing, given that the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist Parties shared Marxist ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Ho Chi Minh had consistently referred to China and Vietnam as comrades and brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, and China had been instrumental in aiding Vietnam against the French and Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Marxist theory dictates that disputes between comrades should be settled through arguments, not artillery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Causes of the Conflict

The military invasion was the culmination of a series of escalating grievances between China and Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The rift had been widening since the Vietnamese Communist Party unified the country following the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Historical Tensions
[[chinavietnam_historical_relations | Vietnam and China]] share a long and complex history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, including nearly 1,000 years of colonization and a 20-year invasion by the Ming Dynasty in the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This history created underlying tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Differing Perceptions and Gratitude
The Vietnamese viewed Chinese intentions as impure, believing China perpetually treated them as a junior partner rather than equals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This perception was reinforced when China bristled at Vietnamese attempts to pursue their own path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
China had provided nearly $20 billion in aid to Vietnam during the war against the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. However, this aid came with the condition that Vietnam could not accept assistance from the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The Chinese, on the other hand, felt angered by what they perceived as Hanoi's lack of gratitude for this aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
Coupled with escalating border clashes and explosions involving ethnic Chinese in Vietnam, Deng Xiaoping's China concluded that Vietnam had become "too big for their britches" and needed to be taught a "lesson for their insolence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Shifting Geopolitics: [[sinosoviet_relations_and_treaty_of_friendship | Sino-Soviet Split]]
A significant factor was the Chinese Communist Party's desire to improve relations with the West and distance itself further from the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. At the time, the Soviet Union was considered China's biggest foreign policy threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The [[sinosoviet_relations_and_treaty_of_friendship | Sino-Soviet Split]] had long been active, stemming from disputes between Mao Zedong and Nikita Khrushchev after Khrushchev's denouncement of Stalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Despite occasional attempts at thawing relations, China distrusted the USSR due to continued Soviet military buildups and live ammunition exercises along their shared border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Deng Xiaoping's Ascendancy and Motives
In July 1977, Deng Xiaoping emerged as China's paramount leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. He secured positions as Communist Party vice-chairman, Central Military Commission vice-chairman, and chief of the People’s Liberation Army General Staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Deng had seized power from Hua Guofeng, Mao Zedong’s appointed successor, during a crucial November 1976 meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This shift marked the decline of ultra-left ideology and the rise of a moderate faction focused on economic modernization and opening to the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, particularly warming relations with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

Invading and "taming" Vietnam was conceivably seen by the global community as a serious indicator of China's sincerity in its intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. It would also demonstrate that China's fighting forces could competently align with the West to counter Soviet influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Deng Xiaoping single-handedly drove the war effort, appearing to harbor an "irrational" grudge against the Vietnamese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. As paramount leader, his decision was unchallenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Military Strategy and Execution

Deng specifically instructed the PLA to limit the war's scope to achieve China's political goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, aiming to avoid becoming bogged down like America in Vietnam and to keep the Soviet Union out of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### War Stages and Objectives
The war was planned in two stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>:
*   **First Stage (February 17-25):** A two-pronged offensive targeting Cao Bang, Lao Cai, and Dong Dang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Second Stage (February 26-March 5):** PLA forces would converge on Lang Son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

Upon completion, the Chinese army would withdraw and declare victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The PLA allocated approximately 330,000 men for the land-based attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### Pre-emptive Actions and Intelligence
Chinese propaganda had been actively running, labeling the Vietnamese as "dogs of the Soviet Union" and the "Cuba of the East" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. A massive evacuation of 300,000 civilians from Heilongjiang and Xinjiang, Soviet border zones, was conducted to guard against a Soviet counterattack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Vietnamese troops were primarily engaged in Cambodia at the time, leaving approximately 150,000 regional security and militia forces to defend against the PLA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Chinese Central Command's military assessments ignored these militias, leading them to assume an overwhelming 8:1 advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This proved to be a costly mistake, as Vietnamese local forces were well-trained and equipped, making the actual advantage closer to 2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Initial Invasion and Challenges for the PLA
On February 17, 1979, at 5 AM, artillery fire erupted along the Sino-Vietnamese border, followed by 100,000 soldiers and tank units advancing towards Lang Son, Cao Bang, and Lao Cai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Lao Cai was a key target due to its railway link to Hanoi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

Deng and Central Command restricted Chinese flying missions to Chinese airspace, denying air support to ground troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The rigid, top-down command structure prevented middle and lower-ranking officers from making independent judgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Consequently, the PLA resorted to sending "waves and waves of human soldiers" against fortifications, leading to thousands of casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

The PLA made progress through sheer numbers, advancing 10 miles into Vietnamese territory, taking border towns, and pushing towards Lao Cai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. They encountered the Vietnamese "Flying Tiger Regiment" en route to Dong Dang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

On February 20, Beijing began publicizing the conflict, claiming "very heavy" Vietnamese losses (10,000 wounded or killed) compared to 2,000-3,000 Chinese casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. However, the PLA also suffered heavily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
[[military_strategies_and_tactics_of_the_PLA | PLA soldiers]] quickly learned the difficulties of jungle fighting, as the Americans had decades prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The PLA was not well-trained for these conditions and suffered immense casualties from tunnel/jungle warfare, booby traps, landmines, and bamboo stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Vietnamese militias expertly used fortified tunnels, caves, and trenches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Rain bogged down operations, forcing troops to use horses and donkeys for transport on muddy roads and rocky mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Infantry soldiers tied themselves to tanks, making them easy targets during ambushes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Tank units suffered particularly heavy losses, with 87% experiencing damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

### Key Engagements
Despite challenges, Lao Cai and Cao Bang were captured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. By February 21-22, forces converged on Lang Son, 85 miles from Hanoi, where the heaviest fighting occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
Following Mao's strategy for urban battles, the PLA first occupied the countryside around Lang Son to prevent getting bogged down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. By March 2, the city was mostly surrounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. On March 3, the PLA attacked the Khua Ma Son mountains to complete the encirclement of Lang Son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, capturing a fortified hill in just 10 minutes and blowing up adjacent Vietnamese artillery positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

## Conclusion and Aftermath

Deng and the Chinese high command consistently emphasized that the conflict would be a limited war with limited aims: to keep Vietnam "in line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. By February 23, a week into the fighting, ambassadors and reporters were informed the war would last "about another week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. This was to prevent larger powers, particularly the Soviet Union, from intervening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This strategy succeeded, as the Soviets ultimately stayed out as long as the fighting remained "limited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

On March 5, Beijing announced their forces had advanced 30-80 miles, captured Lang Son, Cao Bang, Lao Cai, 17 other cities, and severely damaged Vietnamese forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. With political goals achieved, the PLA began to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. The Vietnamese did not escalate and allowed an orderly retreat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

### Casualties and Performance Assessment
Estimates of Chinese casualties vary widely:
*   Beijing initially reported 20,000 killed or wounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   Hanoi claimed inflicting 42,000 Chinese casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   Other estimates range from 6,900 to 25,000 PLA killed and 37,000 wounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

Regardless of the exact numbers, a significant number of Chinese soldiers perished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. For context, the United States suffered around 356,962 killed or wounded over 20 years in Vietnam, a number the PLA would have reached in a year at its peak casualty rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

Party officials acknowledged that the PLA underperformed operationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Army planners had arrogantly claimed they could take Hanoi in a week with a fraction of their forces, but it took 16 days and 10 full divisions to cover only a third of that distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. The PLA did not even face the main Vietnamese army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Weapons were backward, tactics outdated, and morale was low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. The top-down command structure meant soldiers felt their lives were wasted, with some units reportedly "forced" to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

The war revealed the Chinese Communist Party's view of warfare: the PLA is a tool to achieve the Party's political goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. If the Party's objectives are met, the PLA is deemed successful, regardless of military performance or casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This approach mirrors the tactics of the [[economic_impact_of_war_and_revolution_on_the_Soviet_Union | Red Army]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

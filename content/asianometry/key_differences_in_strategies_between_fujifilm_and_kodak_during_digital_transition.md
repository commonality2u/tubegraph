For decades, [[historical_rivalry_and_competition_between_fujifilm_and_kodak | Eastman Kodak and Fujifilm]] dominated the [[rise_and_fall_of_silverbased_photographic_film_industry | silver-based photographic film industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, the sudden and rapid emergence of digital photography annihilated this traditional market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While Fujifilm emerged from this transition as a larger, transformed company, Kodak did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This article explores the key differences in their strategies that led to these divergent outcomes.

## Early History and Market Positioning

Fujifilm was founded in 1934 as a subsidiary of the Dai Nippon Celluloid company, Japan's first cinematic film manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Kodak had previously declined to build a photographic film factory in Japan due to perceived unsuitable climate conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. In response, Dai Nippon, with government support, established Fuji Photo Film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

A core part of Fujifilm's early culture and strategy was an emphasis on developing its own technology internally, rather than importing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Fujifilm is known for spending more on research and development (R&D) than its peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. They successfully developed color photography film, completing their product in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Producing such film required near-semiconductor quality control due to its complex layered structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This focus on technical proficiency allowed Fujifilm to narrow the gap with Kodak and outperform them in certain technical areas by 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

In contrast, Kodak, with its globally recognized brand and seemingly unlimited resources (including its own silver mine and cattle ranch for film materials) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, initially outsourced its Japanese marketing, which led to it occupying the low-end space in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Recognizing the Digital Threat

Both Kodak and Fujifilm recognized that the future was in digital imaging and produced many digital imaging technologies themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Kodak's Early Digital Innovations and Hesitation

In 1975, a Kodak employee named Steve Sasson assembled the first digital camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Despite its rudimentary nature, Kodak employees knew it represented the future, predicting that silver-based imaging would be obsolete by the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Kodak scientists produced high-quality image sensors, including a 1.4 million-pixel CCD sensor in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. However, many of their digital explorations often resulted only in patents and not new successful businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Kodak's main challenge was its inability to settle on a plan for the digital era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. They hesitated to pursue ventures that didn't fit their existing business model, viewing their traditional film position as one of the greatest business models ever discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. For example, they failed to aggressively chase the market for their 1976 Ektaprint printer, which was superior to rivals, due to unfamiliarity with renting heavy equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Fujifilm's Proactive Diversification and Strategic Response

[[diversification_and_innovative_strategies_of_fujifilm | Fujifilm's diversified business]] provided early warnings of the impending digital transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. In 1981, they released a product for diagnostic x-ray imaging that replaced x-ray film with a photosensitive plate, and their Fuji Computed Radiography system (1983) is still in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. The digitization of plate-making for publications also made a computer able to output an entire piece on a single film, raising concerns about the future of film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Recognizing the challenge, Fujifilm appointed Minoru Onishi as its new president in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. He introduced a three-pronged strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>:
1.  **Pioneer Digital Imaging Technologies**: Develop original digital imaging technologies and be a pioneer in that space, similar to Kodak's early efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Fujifilm released its first digital camera, the DS-1P, in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
2.  **Milk the Analog Cash Cow**: Prolong the life of the traditional film business by widening the quality gap with digital through continuous improvements in film image quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
3.  **Build New Business Lines**: Develop new business lines entirely outside of digital photography or analog photographic film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

In the mid-1980s, Fujifilm began investing in various diversifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Some were peripheral to photography (like inkjet and optical disk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, while others leveraged core photographic film manufacturing technologies, such as cancer pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

Despite the film business performing well in the 1980s, with Fujifilm surpassing Kodak technologically and releasing profitable products like the disposable QuickSnap camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, the company continued its diversification efforts.

## The Digital Tipping Point and Subsequent Strategies

The widespread proliferation of the CMOS image sensor, particularly its inclusion in mobile phones starting in 1999, was the final piece of the puzzle that accelerated the decline of silver-based film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. CMOS sensors, while initially producing worse images than CCDs, could be manufactured in huge quantities at low prices using standard silicon semiconductor fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### Fujifilm's "Vision 75" Transformation

In 2004, with its core business imploding, Fujifilm's CEO Shigataka Komori announced "Vision 75" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This plan guided the company beyond its photographic roots with three steps:
1.  **Strategic Reforms**: Implement drastic cost-cutting measures, including closing factories, cutting 15,000 jobs, and canceling sales partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Unlike its competitor Konica, Komori never considered leaving the photography business entirely, aiming to preserve the culture of photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Fujifilm still produces film today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
2.  **Find New Profitable Growth Businesses**: Transition to entirely new markets, many of which grew out of the technology behind their film business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
    *   **Fujitec (TAC films)**: Leveraging their expertise in triacetyl cellulose (TAC) used in film bases, Fujifilm expanded into providing protective coverings for LCD screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. By the 2000s, this became a billion-dollar business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
    *   **Six Priority Businesses**: Based on a review of their lab technologies, Fujifilm identified six areas:
        *   Digital Imaging (high-end digital cameras) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>
        *   Optical Devices (lenses for broadcast, security, etc. - Fujinon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>
        *   Specialty Chemicals/Materials (serving solar, touch panel, [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | semiconductor industries]], even photoresists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>
        *   Graphics (digital printing, inkjet technology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>
        *   Documents (printers, office copiers, largely through Fuji Xerox joint venture, which became their largest business line in 2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>
        *   Healthcare: Fujifilm's major diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. They expanded beyond x-ray films and medical imaging systems into skincare cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. This leveraged their expertise from film production in emulsions, oxidation, and collagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. They augmented this with acquisitions of medical imaging companies and Toyama Chemical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

By its 2008 fiscal year, Fujifilm reported its highest sales in history, significantly increasing revenue and operating profit, with imaging products decreasing from 54% to 19% of total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

### Kodak's Failed Diversification and Decline

[[challenges_and_failures_in_kodaks_diversification_attempts | Kodak's attempts to diversify]] were largely unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. While they did shrink their film manufacturing business and cut jobs, they could never move beyond the idea of selling film and providing photography services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

Previous CEO Colby Chandler's efforts to diversify into floppy disks, batteries, artificial snow, and pharmaceuticals were reversed by his successors, who doubled down on imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.
*   In 1993, Kodak spun off its specialty chemical business (formed in 1920), which now, as Eastman Chemical, is a $10 billion Fortune 500 company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
*   They also sold off their Sterling Winthrop drug unit, which generated over $1 billion annually, including Bayer Aspirin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.
*   Despite researching and filing pharmaceutical and medical equipment patents at the same time as Fujifilm, Kodak withdrew from these ventures in 1996 to double down on photography, branding themselves an "Imaging company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

Kodak did develop and promote new digital technologies, even holding leading market share in the U.S. digital camera space in 2004-2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. However, like Fujifilm, they quickly learned that digital cameras were a terrible business, with intense competition driving down market share and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

Kodak's foray into the inkjet printer business in 2005 against giants like Hewlett-Packard resulted in significant net losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. In 2007, they sold their last valuable asset, their healthcare division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Saddled with debt, Kodak filed for bankruptcy five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

## Fundamental Difference in Identity

The core difference between the two companies' fates lies in their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. Kodak was primarily a consumer brand with a strong technology base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. Fujifilm, conversely, began as a technology company that happened to sell to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.

When their consumer businesses vanished, Fujifilm found it easier to revert to its roots as a chemical and manufacturing precision company, leveraging its expertise to diversify into new businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Kodak, despite its early innovations, could not break free from its identity as a film and photography services company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. Fujifilm still keeps "Film" in its name as an indication of where its technological expertise originated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

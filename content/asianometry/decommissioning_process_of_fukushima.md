In March 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake triggered a massive tsunami that crippled the cooling systems of the [[fukushima_daiichi_nuclear_disaster | Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This led to a meltdown of the plant's nuclear fuel and several hydrogen explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Since the accident, the plant's owner, TEPCO, and the Japanese government have invested billions of dollars into the site's safe and efficient decommissioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. To reduce human safety risks, a series of advanced, radiation-hardened [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] have been developed and deployed to perform critical tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

The Fukushima Daiichi plant originally had six units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Units four, five, and six were not operational during the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Units five and six suffered minor tsunami damage but remained essentially functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Unit four was damaged by the tsunami and experienced a hydrogen explosion from exhaust spillover from Unit 3, but its fuel rods suffered little damage due to the reactor being shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Units one through three, which were operational when the tsunami hit, suffered the worst damage, including meltdowns and hydrogen explosions that released radioactive materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Early Nuclear Response Robots

The first nuclear response [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] were developed in the United States after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Two robots were used for site inspection in high-radiation areas inaccessible to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

*   **Surveillance and In-Service Inspection Robot (SIR)**: First deployed in August 1982, it was a crawler that took photographs, collected samples, and made radiation readings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **FRED**: Introduced a year after SIR, FRED was equipped with a high-pressure water spray for decontamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Remote Reconnaissance Vehicles**: Three were built to de-fuel the Three Mile Island reactor core, which was flooded with radioactive water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. These small, tethered robots flushed, scraped, and cleaned walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

After the Chernobyl disaster, the Soviet Union initially relied on hundreds of thousands of human "biorobots" for cleanup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This was partly due to extremely high radiation levels that caused available [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] to fail and bureaucratic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Eventually, [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] were brought in, notably the **Specialized Transport Robot (STR-1)**, a wirelessly controlled bulldozer adapted from an unmanned lunar vehicle for debris removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Initial Robot Response at Fukushima

The first [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] arrived at Fukushima in April 2011, three weeks after the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **PakBot**: Four military multipurpose robots from American company iRobot Corporation USA were used to enter the damaged Unit 1, 2, and 3 reactor buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. PakBot, previously used for detecting and diffusing improvised explosive devices in Iraq and Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, measured radiation dosage, atmospheric temperatures, and oxygen concentrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Warrior**: A larger iRobot was later brought in for additional cleaning, vacuuming, and clearing obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **T-Hawk**: A small unmanned aerial vehicle from Honeywell, it flew over Units 1 through 4 from April 10th to July 24th to review the situation and collect dust samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

The use of American [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] sparked a mild controversy, questioning Japan's own advanced robotics technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Japanese Robot Development Post-Disaster

After a criticality accident in September 1999, three Japanese technology centers developed a line of nuclear disaster [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Remote Surveillance Squad (RESCUE)**: Built by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, these three robots were designed for measurements and sample collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. However, due to a lack of budget, they received few upgrades after their completion in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. When the Fukushima disaster occurred ten years later, the robots were not ready, with many critical components out of stock and no trained operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **JAEA-3**: Over the next few months, JAEA re-engineered the RESCUE robot into the JAEA-3, grafting parts from a BROKK robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. It began missions in September 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Kinsei Series**: The PakBot's limitations (radio communication range, inability to climb stairs) led TEPCO to the Kinsei series of search and rescue robots developed by the Neito project at the Chiba Institute of Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Kinsei was waterproof and highly mobile across difficult terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. TEPCO requested modifications to harden the robots against radioactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Radiation Hardening for Robotics

Nuclear accidents release various types of radiation, including alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, x-rays, and neutron particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. When radiation interacts with semiconductor materials, two main effects can occur:
1.  **Displacement Effect**: Particles like neutrons and alpha particles collide with semiconductors, displacing atoms and altering structural arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This degrades device properties, leading to higher current leakage and decreased lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
2.  **Ionization Effect**: Electrons, protons, and x-rays passing through semiconductors create electron-hole pairs, causing permanent glitches and erratic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

Radiation damage can occur at device, circuit, and system levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Device Level**: Hardening involves changing transistor layout, adding insulating substrates (like silicon-on-insulator), or making devices larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Circuit Level**: Includes duplicating critical circuits or adding monitor circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **System Level**: Involves adding radiation armor, redundancies, and preventive scrubbing algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Kinsei, made from conventional electronics, underwent gamma ray testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Its essential components (180nm CPU, motherboard, motor driver boards) could survive about 200 Grays (20,000 rads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Since initial measurements at Fukushima were around 100 Grays, Kinsei was estimated to work for over 100 hours with only a 10% chance of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. The new Kinsei entered the reactor buildings in June 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. After five successful missions, a broken communications link forced the abandonment of one Kinsei robot on the third floor in October 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Kinsei 2 and 3 were redesigned to fix this flaw and deployed in February 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Decommissioning Phases

The Japanese government's long-term goals involve gradually decommissioning the plant and rebuilding the surrounding area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This multi-step process is overseen by TEPCO and the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning (IRID) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### 1. Cleanup and Rubble Removal
The hydrogen explosions scattered rubble across the site, requiring removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **As-Taco Sora**: Developed by Hitachi, this heavy-duty robot collects rubble into recycling bins using its two arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Raccoon and Arounder**: Smaller cleaner bots that spray down the ground around Reactor Unit 2 with high-pressure water or dry ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Meister**: A heavy-duty robot that can drill for samples or vacuum up particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

### 2. Spent Fuel Rod Removal
Each unit contains a spent fuel assembly for storing fuel no longer useful for energy generation, which must be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Unit 4**: In December 2014, TEPCO successfully removed 1,535 spent fuel rods from the damaged Unit 4 reactor pool, relocating them to a cooling pool in Unit 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Unit 3**: TEPCO began removing 566 spent fuel rods from Unit 3 in 2019, completing the task in February 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Units 1 and 2**: Removal of spent fuel rods for these units is scheduled to begin in 2023 or later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### 3. Melted Fuel Debris (Corium) Removal
In Units 1 through 3, the nuclear fuel melted down, burning through its original location in the reactor pressure vessel and the concrete pedestal, eventually reaching the primary containment vessel (PCV) before emergency water cooling solidified it into nuclear fuel debris, officially named corium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This corium must be inspected and eventually removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. IRID used different [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] to investigate each reactor's unique circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

*   **Unit 1 Inspection**: Unit 1's PCV is flooded to a depth of 2 meters, likely containing corium at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. In 2012, TEPCO and the team punched a small hole into the PCV for a wired camera and water tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
    *   **P-Morph**: In 2014, IRID developed a morphing [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robot]] designed to squeeze through a 100mm hole and then transform into a U-shape to navigate around a lead plate for radiation shielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Although the first P-Morph encountered an obstacle and was abandoned, improvements allowed later missions to be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The next step is to build a [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robot]] to collect the pebble-like fuel debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

*   **Unit 2 Inspection**: Unit 2 suffered a meltdown but no hydrogen explosion, leaving its building structure intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
    *   **Scorpion**: TEPCO produced this [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robot]], which, like P-Morph, could crawl through a small hole and reconfigure itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Deployed in 2017 after significant pathway clearing, its left tread failed, and it was left inside the reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. The team eventually photographed the entire reactor interior using a camera suspended from a "fishing rod" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

*   **Unit 3 Inspection**: The corium inside Unit 3 was the last to be photographed because its PCV is almost entirely flooded to a depth of about 6 meters, requiring new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. The Unit 2 entrance approach was not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, and the best entry point was only 14 centimeters across <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
    *   **Mini Manbo**: It took two years to build this tiny [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robot]], measuring just 13 cm across and 30 cm long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. In 2017, the Mini Manbo successfully recorded video of the nuclear debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

### Future Debris Removal
Now that the melted nuclear fuel has been located, work can begin on its removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. IRID and TEPCO plan to start with Unit 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. A massive stainless steel robotic arm will be built outside the PCV to reach in through a hole and pick up the debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. As of this writing, the project start has been delayed into 2023 to improve the arm's capabilities and add attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

IRID anticipates it will take at least 10 years to remove all nuclear fuel debris from the Fukushima site, with further cleaning and decontamination work needed for years beyond that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Despite the ongoing challenges, conditions have improved enough for the government to allow local residents to return home, such as in Kuma, the town closest to the plant, in April 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. However, only a small percentage of residents have returned, indicating the significant work ahead for both people and [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

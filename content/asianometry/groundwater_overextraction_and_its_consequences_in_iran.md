From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Iran faces a long-running water problem due to its naturally arid climate and low rainfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Much of its central lands are uninhabitable without sufficient water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Over the years, the country developed a sprawling industrial water system to irrigate dry soil and support a booming population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This has led to significant [[challenges_and_reforms_needed_in_irans_water_management_system | water management issues]], particularly concerning groundwater.

## Shift to Groundwater Reliance

Historically, Iran relied on sophisticated water supply systems like the *qanat*, underground tunnels that brought snowmelt water from mountains to plains using gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. However, in the 1900s, water needs outgrew the qanat's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

After World War One, a new government under Reza Shah Pahlavi sought to modernize the country, leading to nomads being settled into villages, which created a need for consistent water supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. With limited surface water, Iranians turned to hydraulic mega-projects, including modern water wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

The first modern water well was built in Iran in 1915 and quickly gained popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Drilling for groundwater with an electrically powered pump was much faster and easier than constructing or extending qanats, which could take years of manual labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. At the time, Iran had plentiful amounts of groundwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Authorities actively promoted these modern systems, leading to the decline and disrepair of qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. By 1950, qanats supplied only 50% of the country's water, down from 75% in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

The 1963 White Revolution land reform scheme, implemented by Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, further impacted qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The reform transferred agricultural lands from landlords to peasants, but in doing so, it removed the traditional funding for qanat maintenance by landlords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. No centralized authority adequately took over this responsibility, and the Iranian Ministry of Water and Power (established in 1964) largely ignored them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. By 2000, less than 10% of Iran's water came from qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Current Groundwater Dependency and Extraction

Groundwater has become Iran's primary water source, accounting for 55% of the total supply in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. A 2021 study by Nature, based on publicly available data from Iranian wells, estimated that over 74 cubic kilometers of water were extracted from the ground between 2002 and 2015 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This volume is equivalent to the 34th largest freshwater lake in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

Despite theoretical regulations on drilling wells, there is little enforcement of these laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. The number of wells in Iran surged from 47,000 in 1979 to 789,000 in 2013, with almost all of them being illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. This massive increase highlights the scale of water demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

## Consequences of Overextraction

The overextraction of groundwater has several severe consequences:

*   **Declining Water Table** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>: As more groundwater is withdrawn, the water table drops, forcing people to drill deeper wells to access water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. This issue is intensified during the country's serious [[effects_of_climate_change_and_drought_on_irans_water_resources | droughts]], which are expected to worsen with [[effects_of_climate_change_and_drought_on_irans_water_resources | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   **Increased Salinity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>: The soil and groundwater become saltier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. In some agricultural areas like the Karkheh Basin, electrical conductivity measurements (an indicator of salinity) are 85% higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **[[consequences_of_reservoir_silting | Land Subsidence]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>: Declining groundwater levels cause the ground to literally sink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Iran's land is shrinking by an average of about six centimeters per year, with some areas experiencing a staggering 19 centimeters per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.
    *   **Damage to Infrastructure**: Sinking ground damages transmission lines, bridges, and buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. It also undermines structural safety, posing a risk during earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
    *   **Permanent Aquifer Damage**: [[consequences_of_reservoir_silting | Subsidence]] permanently damages the aquifer's capacity to hold water, meaning it cannot be recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

## Underlying Issues

While Iran's massive population contributes to lower renewable water per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, the core of Iran's [[challenges_and_reforms_needed_in_irans_water_management_system | water crisis]] lies in demand and mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. Difficult decisions are needed regarding water usage in homes, industry, and especially agriculture, which accounts for 93% of Iran's water use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. The government's policy of heavily subsidizing water and fertilizer for farmers has encouraged inefficient use, with average irrigation efficiency below 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

Implementing necessary long-term reforms will be challenging for a populist government operating one of the world's most heavily subsidized economies amid a turbulent climate and political situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. However, the long-term costs of this water mismanagement are significant, making reforms necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

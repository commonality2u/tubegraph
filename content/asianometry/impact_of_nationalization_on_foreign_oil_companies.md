The Soviet nationalization of the oil industry had a profound impact on foreign oil companies, leading to significant financial losses and a complex period of engagement and disengagement.

## Nationalization of Assets (Early 20th Century)

At the start of the 1960s, the Soviet Union was the world's second-largest oil producer, nearly matching the entire Middle East's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, this dominance was built upon an industry that had a private, foreign-influenced past.

In the late 1880s, Baku, annexed by the Russian Empire in the 1820s, became one of the world's leading oil production sites, reaching a third of America's output at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. By 1914, 90% of Russia's oil came from Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. While the Tsar owned the fields and gained significant revenue from indirect taxes, over 20 private companies, most notably [[influence_of_nobel_brothers_on_russian_oil_production | Nobel Brothers]], tended to the fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

As the Russian Empire collapsed in 1919, major British oil companies like Shell (then Royal Dutch Shell) attempted to organize an annexation of Russia's oil regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. However, the British government refused to back them with armed intervention in the Caucasus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. As a result, when the Soviets took over and nationalized all assets, Western oil companies suffered massive financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Shell alone lost approximately 171.4 million Rubles of British Capital, and French and German investors also lost millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Shell continued to expect the imminent collapse of the Soviet state as late as 1925 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Post-Nationalization Engagement: A Pragmatic Shift

After the Russian Civil War, the Bolsheviks desperately needed Baku's oil to fuel their armies and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Following their reconquest of the area in December 1920, they found a wasteland, with production at only a third of pre-war numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

In 1921, with the Soviet economy in shambles, Lenin initiated the New Economic Policy, which controversially allowed for the potential resumption of concessions to foreign capitalists for natural resource exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Despite debate within the Politburo, with figures like Alexei Rykov, Mikhail Tomsky, and Joseph Stalin opposing it, Lenin successfully advocated for the policy, winning an 8-6 vote in February 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. He argued that "without concessions we cannot hope to receive the benefits of advanced modern capitalist technology and without that technology we cannot build the foundations for our large-scale industry in sectors such as the extraction of petroleum which is of such extraordinary importance for the entire world economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Reports from Baku detailed broken transportation, supply shortages, and saltwater intrusions, leading to worker strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This led to recommendations for the Soviets to engage global oil syndicates immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Failed Concessions and US Disengagement

In a calculated bet on the Soviet Union's collapse, Nobel Brothers shrewdly sold half of their nationalized Russian oil assets for $7-9 million to Standard Oil of New Jersey (forerunner of Exxon Mobil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Standard Oil then joined Shell and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in negotiations for vast concession tracks in Baku and Grozny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. A deal for Standard and Anglo-Persian to control half of Grozny and build a pipeline to the Black Sea almost materialized, but Standard eventually passed under pressure from the Warren G. Harding Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

Other attempts at foreign concessions also failed:
*   In 1923, Sinclair Oil Corporation offered a $250 million loan for a near-complete 25-year monopoly on Grozny's richest oil areas, but the Soviets declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. They did grant Sinclair a concession to Sakhalin Island, but the Japanese prevented drilling there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Sinclair later pulled out due to its implication in the Teapot Dome scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   International Barnsdall Corporation, a small American company, was given permission to scope out undeveloped lands but pulled out in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

The United States government at the time considered the Soviet regime illegitimate and discouraged trade, as the Soviets had repudiated the Russian Empire's debt, nationalized American private property, and advocated for the overthrow of the American government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This, combined with Lenin's illnesses, closed the window for foreign capitalism in the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

### Post-War Acquisition of Technology

Despite the initial losses from nationalization, some foreign companies later engaged with the Soviets. British equipment played a crucial role in the Soviet oil industry's resurgence. Vickers, a British weapons and engineering firm that had suffered over two million pounds in losses from Soviet nationalization, chose to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. They began selling turbines for the national electrification plan (Guelro) in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. In 1924, after demonstrating modern oil drilling equipment to a Soviet delegation, Vickers delivered millions of pounds worth of equipment to Baku and Grozny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The Soviets paid Vickers a percentage of their foreign oil sales, keeping Vickers' struggling oil equipment business afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

After World War II, the Soviets continued to acquire foreign oil technologies, confiscating much of it from Soviet-occupied territories like Romania and Austria as "war booty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. This strategic acquisition of technology, alongside massive investment in domestic fields like the Volga-Ural Basin, contributed to the [[postwar_soviet_oil_expansion_and_political_influence | Soviet Union's oil ascendancy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

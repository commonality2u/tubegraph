From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

In the mid-1990s, the photolithography market was dominated by two Japanese companies, Nikon and Canon, which together held a three-quarter share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, a Dutch company, [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]], emerged to overtake them, relegating them to minor players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Today, Nikon and Canon no longer compete at the cutting edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, while [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] has become Europe's most valuable technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Photolithography Basics

A photolithography stepper or scanner is a nanoscale printer designed to imprint integrated circuit patterns onto a silicon wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Each wafer can contain hundreds of dies, which eventually become parts of chips like the Apple M1 or A13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The process involves several steps:
1.  A silicon wafer is coated with a chemical called photoresist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  A stepper or scanner projects the integrated circuit design onto the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
3.  Areas not exposed by the baked photoresist are etched away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
This process is repeated to achieve the desired level of sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While not the only machine used, the photolithography machine is one of the most critical in semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Historical Context: US to Japanese Dominance

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the United States, primarily through companies like Perkin-Elmer and Geophysics Corporation of America (GCA), dominated the photolithography tools market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This alarmed the Japanese government, which, through the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), reorganized its computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. They gathered top optical manufacturers and mandated them to catch up to American leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This initiative, known as the VLSI Research Project, led to Nikon introducing its first commercial stepper in 1980, with Canon quickly following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. These Japanese products offered superior performance at a lower price, allowing Nikon and Canon to overthrow American dominance and rule the market in less than a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. By the mid-1990s, Japan's technical lead seemed insurmountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## [[Development and history of ASML lithography technology | ASML]]'s Ascent

[[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between Dutch firms ASM International and Philips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The semiconductor supplier industry faced significant challenges due to economic fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] incurred losses for its first six years, leading ASM to sell its shares to Philips and two banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. In 1990, [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] was spun out as an independent company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Despite this, strong ties to Philips remained; Philips was a major shareholder, located nearby, and many [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] employees also worked there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Along with Carl Zeiss, these three companies formed a practical block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Philips's backing allowed [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] to persist and gain a market foothold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. By its IPO in 1995, [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] had secured 25% market share, tying with Canon for third place, behind leader Nikon at 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Three major industry generational events allowed [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] to snatch market leadership:

### 1. Twinscan System
In 2001, [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] developed and released its first Twinscan system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This system processes wafers in two stages: a measurement stage (collecting wafer information like position) and an exposure stage (where ultraviolet light is applied) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This "dual wielding" significantly increased wafers processed per hour but also added complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Nikon and Canon could not replicate this technology quickly enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] rapidly iterated on its success, achieving 50% market share by 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### 2. Immersion Lithography
The second breakthrough was a generational shift to immersion lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Previous techniques had an air gap between the wafer and stepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Immersion lithography replaced this air gap with water, directing ultraviolet light through water onto the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This technique, though sounding unusual, had long been used in optical microscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The industry largely ignored it until Taiwanese scientist Burn Lin demonstrated its viability for reaching a 45 nanometer process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]], Nikon, and Canon quickly worked to commercialize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] was first, releasing the Twinscan AT1150i in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Three years later, the Twinscan XT 1700i, their first volume immersion product, cemented their dominant position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### 3. [[ASML and the commercialization of EUV lithography | EUV Lithography]]
The semiconductor industry knew immersion lithography was a stop-gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>; optical wavelengths would eventually be insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The industry debated between particle-based solutions (ion beam, e-beam) and X-ray-based solutions like [[ASML and the commercialization of EUV lithography | EUV]] (Extreme Ultraviolet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Ultimately, [[ASML and the commercialization of EUV lithography | EUV]] was chosen, and major chipmakers banded together to help [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] commercialize the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Practical [[ASML and highvolume EUV systems | EUV systems]] were delayed by a decade and went significantly over budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Canon never had a chance in this area, and Nikon largely halted progress after 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. [[ASML and the commercialization of EUV lithography | EUV]] cemented the massive technical gap between [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] and its Japanese competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Reasons for Japan's Decline and [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]]'s Success

Several theories explain [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]]'s rise and Canon/Nikon's fall:

### Software Expertise
[[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]]'s machines have exploded in complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. By 2000, their products used 6 times more CPUs and 8 times more sensors than their 1989 counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The 1989 PAS 5000 stepper had 200 million lines of source code, while the 2003 Twinscan had 1.25 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. A single Twinscan contained 12.5 million lines of embedded device code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, and the software team grew to over 350 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, doubling in size every four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] managed this complexity by being one of the first companies to use Unified Modeling Language (UML) for abstract software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. In contrast, Canon and Nikon were not strong in software and only recently adopted abstraction-heavy software practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### Decline of Japanese Semiconductor Industry
Nikon and Canon's market share rise coincided with Japan's entire semiconductor industry gaining traction in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Japanese companies like NEC, Mitsubishi Electric, Hitachi, and Toshiba dominated the chip-making market, especially memory, holding 90% of the 256K DRAM market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. These companies formed Nikon and Canon's core market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. However, in the 1990s, low-cost Japanese exports became a political issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Japanese companies built massive overcapacity and dumped products overseas at below cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The American semiconductor industry successfully lobbied for limits on their Japanese competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Combined with the appreciation of the Yen, Japan pulled back, leading to a significant loss of business for Nikon and Canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### Focus Beyond Optics
Canon and Nikon began as optics systems companies, and their lithography tool development always centered on lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. As semiconductor engineering pushed physical limits, engineers had to seek other avenues for gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Perhaps because [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] outsourced all its optics R&D to Zeiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, it could look beyond mere optics to optimize tool performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This included opportunities related to better utilizing new chemicals in photoresist and photomasks, and the two-stage wafer swap process that led to the Twinscan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### R&D and Industry Collaboration
[[ASMLs partnerships and collaborations | ASML]]'s rise greatly benefited from R&D and industry collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The [[ASMLs partnerships and collaborations | ASML]]-Philips-Zeiss block had close ties to IMEC, a semi-governmental nonprofit in Belgium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. IMEC works closely with industry and academia to develop new technologies and plays a crucial role in facilitating cross-industry collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This exposure helped [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] understand how customers used their tools and how they interacted with other vendors' equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. [[ASMLs partnerships and collaborations | ASML]]'s collaborative nature is evident in its joint publications with chipmakers, tool makers, and chemical makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

In contrast, Canon and Nikon lacked a similar collaborative body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Most of Nikon's published papers were authored by themselves alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. While Japanese companies exchanged information with long-term outside partners, these exchanges were often limited; customers only contacted tool makers for serious problems, not for improvement ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Though Japan's earlier VLSI project fostered resource sharing, it was government-mandated, and nothing similar has since taken its place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

Ties between industry and academia in Japan are also weak compared to Western counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Industry professionals are wary of disclosing trade secrets, and Japanese professors often focus on basic science without incentives for industrial application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This contrasts with institutions like MIT, Stanford, and Berkeley, which have technology licensing organizations to guide and profit from discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. For example, the practical commercial system breakthroughs for immersion lithography came from an American researcher at MIT who ran experiments under industry-standard conditions, indicating close ties with industry professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## Conclusion

While [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]]'s rise is attributed to its strengths, it also coincided with a decline in competitiveness by the Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. The exact reasons for Nikon and Canon's failure remain complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. A key lesson is the importance of paying close attention to generational shifts in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Immersion and [[ASML and the commercialization of EUV lithography | EUV]] represented such shifts, where industry dynamics changed, turning winners into losers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] must consider this as researchers push for the next generation of semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Despite the high-profile decline of Canon and Nikon, Japan's semiconductor industry still holds many hidden champions who adapted and survived, remaining critical to the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

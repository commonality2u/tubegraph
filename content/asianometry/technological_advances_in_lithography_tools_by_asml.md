In the mid-1990s, the photolithography market was dominated by two Japanese companies, Nikon and Canon, which together held a three-quarter share [00:00:04]. A Dutch company, [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]], subsequently rose to overtake them, becoming Europe's most valuable technology company, while Nikon and Canon no longer compete at the cutting edge [00:00:17]. This article details how [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] achieved market share and technological leadership [00:00:35].

## Basics of Photolithography

A photolithography stepper or scanner acts as a nanoscale printer, transferring integrated circuit patterns onto a wafer [00:01:06]. A single wafer can contain hundreds of dies, which are the eventual parts for chips like the Apple M1 or A13 [00:01:13]. The simplified process involves coating a silicon wafer with a photoresist chemical [00:01:24]. The stepper or scanner then projects the integrated circuit design onto the wafer [00:01:29]. After exposure, the unexposed areas are etched away [00:01:34]. This process is repeated until the desired level of sophistication is achieved, making the photolithography machine one of the most critical machines in semiconductor manufacturing [00:01:40].

## The Rise of ASML

From the 1960s to the 1970s, the United States, with companies like PerkinElmer and Geophysics Corporation of America (GCA), dominated the photolithography tools market [00:01:56]. Alarmed by this, the Japanese government, through the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, initiated the VLSI research project [00:02:09]. By 1980, Nikon introduced its first commercial stepper, quickly followed by Canon [00:02:36]. These Japanese products offered superior performance at a low price, allowing them to overthrow American dominance in less than a decade [00:02:42].

[[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between Dutch firms ASM International and Philips [00:03:02]. The company initially faced financial challenges, losing money for its first six years [00:03:17]. In 1990, [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] was spun out as an independent company, though it retained strong links with Philips, which remained a major shareholder [00:03:24]. Philips' backing, along with the partnership with Carl Zeiss, helped [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] persist and gain a market foothold [00:03:44]. By the time [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] IPO'd in 1995, it had acquired 25% market share, tying with Canon and trailing Nikon (45%) [00:03:50].

## Key Technological Breakthroughs

[[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]]'s ascent to market leadership was driven by three major generational events in the industry:

### Twinscan System
In 2001, [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] released its first Twinscan system [00:04:16]. This system processes wafers in two stages: a measurement stage and an exposure stage [00:04:21]. In the measurement stage, the system gathers information about the wafer's position [00:04:29]. This information is then used in the exposure stage, where the wafer is exposed to ultraviolet light [00:04:36]. This dual-stage approach significantly increased the number of wafers processed per hour, though it added complexity [00:04:44]. Nikon and Canon were unable to replicate this technology quickly [00:04:53]. [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] rapidly iterated on its success, achieving 50% market share of the lithography tools market by 2002 [00:04:57].

### Immersion Lithography
The second breakthrough came with immersion lithography, a generational shift in photolithography techniques [00:05:07]. Unlike previous methods that used an air gap between the wafer and the stepper, immersion lithography replaces this gap with water, allowing ultraviolet light to be shot through water onto the wafer [00:05:16]. Although this technique was long used in optical microscopes, it was largely ignored by the industry until Taiwanese scientist Burn Lin demonstrated its viability for reaching a 45 nanometer process node [00:05:32].

[[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]], Nikon, and Canon all worked to commercialize this technique [00:05:48]. [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] was first, releasing the Twinscan AT1150i in 2003 [00:05:54]. Three years later, the Twinscan XT1700i, the first volume immersion product, cemented [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]]'s dominant position [00:06:00].

### [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV Lithography]]
The semiconductor industry recognized that immersion lithography was a temporary solution, as optical wavelengths would eventually be insufficient for printing next-generation semiconductors [00:06:10]. The industry debated between particle-based solutions (like ion beam and e-beam) and x-ray-based solutions, including [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV]] [00:06:23]. Ultimately, [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV]] was chosen as the next-generation solution, with major chipmakers supporting [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] in commercializing the technology [00:06:34].

Commercial [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | EUV systems]] arrived a decade late and significantly over budget, highlighting the immense challenges [00:06:47]. Canon never posed a threat, and Nikon largely halted its progress in [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] after 2011 [00:06:52]. The successful commercialization of [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV]] cemented the massive technological gap between [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] and its Japanese competitors [00:07:05].

## Factors Contributing to ASML's Success

Several theories explain [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]]'s success and the decline of Canon and Nikon:

### Software Prowess
[[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]]'s machines increased in complexity over the years [00:07:37]. By 2000, [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]]'s products used six times the number of CPUs and eight times the number of sensors compared to their 1989 products [00:07:44]. The 1989 PAS 5000 stepper had 200 million lines of source code, while the 2003 Twinscan had 1.25 billion, a six-fold increase [00:07:58]. A single Twinscan machine contained 12.5 million lines of embedded device code for orchestrating component movements [00:08:11]. [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]]'s software team employed over 350 people at one point and doubled in size every four years [00:08:21].

[[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] managed this complexity by being one of the first companies to use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to visualize and develop software modules at an abstract level, which was critical for their 2000 shipments [00:08:36]. In contrast, Canon and Nikon were not as proficient in software and adopted abstraction-heavy software practices much later [00:08:55].

### Decline of Japanese Semiconductor Industry
Canon and Nikon's market share rise coincided with the peak of Japan's semiconductor industry in the 1980s, where companies like NEC, Mitsubishi Electric, Hitachi, and Toshiba dominated the chip-making market, particularly memory, holding 90% of the 256K DRAM market [00:09:06]. Many of these companies were core customers for Canon and Nikon's lithography tools [00:09:33].

However, in the 1990s, Japanese low-cost exports became a political issue, leading to limits placed on Japanese competitors by the American semiconductor industry [00:09:39]. Combined with the appreciation of the yen, Japan's industry pulled back, leading to a significant loss of business for Nikon and Canon [00:09:55]. While another Japanese tool supplier, Tokyo Electron, successfully looked abroad to replenish lost business, Nikon and Canon were less successful [00:10:05].

### Focus Beyond Optics
Canon and Nikon originated as optics systems companies, with their lithography tools' core always harkening back to lenses [00:10:23]. However, as semiconductor engineering reached physical limits, engineers had to seek other avenues for gains [00:10:33]. [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]], by outsourcing all its optics R&D to Zeiss, was able to look beyond mere optics [00:10:44]. This allowed them to find new opportunities to optimize tool performance, such as better utilizing new chemicals in photoresists and photomasks, and developing the two-stage wafer swap process that led to the Twinscan system [00:10:48].

### R&D and Industry Collaboration
Collaboration played a significant role in [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]]'s success [00:11:13]. The [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]]-Philips-Zeiss block benefited from close ties to Imec, a semi-governmental non-profit research center in Belgium [00:11:19]. Imec facilitates cross-industry collaboration, helping companies develop new standards and ideas, which in turn helped [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] understand how its tools were used and how they interacted with other vendors' equipment [00:11:42]. Evidence of [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]]'s collaborative nature is seen in the number of papers jointly published with chipmakers, tool makers, and chemical makers [00:12:01].

In contrast, Canon and Nikon lacked a similar collaborative body [00:12:16]. A study of Nikon's published papers showed most were self-authored [00:12:21]. While Japanese companies did exchange information with long-term partners, these exchanges were often limited to problem-solving rather than proactive collaboration on improvements [00:12:27]. This contrasts with the 1980s, when the government-mandated VLSI project forced Japanese competitors to share resources and solve industry-wide problems, leading to their initial success [00:12:50].

Furthermore, ties between industry and academia in Japan are weaker than in the West [00:13:44]. Japanese industry professionals are cautious about disclosing trade secrets, while university professors focus more on basic science and are not heavily incentivized to see their work industrialized [00:13:50]. This is critical as breakthroughs, like the practical commercial system for immersion lithography, came from American researchers at MIT who ran experiments under industry-standard conditions, a result of meeting with industry professionals [00:13:17]. Japanese universities began reforming this in the mid-2000s by building technology licensing organizations, similar to those at MIT, Stanford, and Berkeley [00:14:05].

## Conclusion

[[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]]'s rise was inextricably linked to the simultaneous decline in competitiveness of its Japanese rivals [00:14:21]. While a definitive single reason for Japan's loss remains elusive, a key lesson is the importance of adapting to generational shifts in technology, such as immersion and [[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | EUV]] [00:14:37]. These periods shift the industry landscape, turning winners into losers and vice versa [00:14:48]. As researchers push towards the next generation of semiconductor manufacturing, [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] must also consider this ongoing evolution [00:14:53].

Despite the high-profile decline of Canon and Nikon, Japan's semiconductor industry still contains many hidden champions, built on legacies and proficiencies from earlier years, who made the right decisions and adapted to survive [00:15:02]. While not as flashy as [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML]] or Applied Materials, these companies remain crucial to the industry [00:15:22].

At the start of the 1960s, the [[Soviet economy in the 1960s | Soviet Union]] held the position of the world's second-largest oil producer, surpassed only by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Its oil output nearly equaled the total production from the entire Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Many European countries relied on [[influence_of_soviet_oil_exports_on_international_relations | Soviet oil]], a dependency the Communist Party leveraged for its strategic advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Historical Context

### Early Russian Oil Industry
The origins of Russia's significant oil industry trace back to the late 1880s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. In the late 1820s, the Russian Empire annexed Baku from the Iranians, a city that grew to become a leading oil production site throughout the 1800s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. By the 1880s, Baku's oil production reached a third of America's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, and by 1914, 90% of Russia's oil came from Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The Czar owned all oil fields, with his government generating a quarter of its revenue through indirect oil production taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Over 20 private companies, including Nobel Brothers (Branobel), tended the fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Nobel Brothers, founded by Ludwig and Robert Nobel, became one of the world's largest oil companies, introducing pipelines and tankers to the Russian oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

Despite a corporate-friendly policy shift aimed at challenging Standard Oil, the Baku oil industry stagnated due to a lack of funds and division between bureaucrats and businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Production declined from a peak of 11.5 million metric tons in 1901 to 9.4 million in 1916 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, with Russia exporting less than a million tons annually after 1904 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Bolshevik Policies and Nationalization
In 1919, British oil companies like Shell attempted to annex Russian oil regions as the Empire collapsed, but the British government refused military intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Western oil companies suffered massive financial losses when the Soviets nationalized all assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Shell alone lost an estimated 171.4 million Rubles of British capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

During the Russian Civil War, the Red Army reconquered Baku in December 1920 to secure its oil, which was vital for industry and military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. However, they found a "wasteland" with production at a third of pre-war levels due to natural decline and war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

Facing economic shambles in 1921, Lenin introduced the New Economic Policy, which controversially allowed for potential concessions to foreign capitalists to exploit natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Despite opposition from figures like Alexei Rykov, Mikhail Tomsky, and Joseph Stalin, Lenin argued that foreign technology was essential for building large-scale industry, particularly in petroleum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Reports from Baku indicated broken transportation, supply shortages, and saltwater intrusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. A workers' strike in April 1921 protesting conditions was "liquidated," but local reports recommended engaging global oil syndicates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This period offered a critical opportunity for Soviet engagement with the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

American oil giants saw cheap Soviet oil as a chance to outmaneuver European rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Standard Oil of New Jersey, the forerunner of Exxon Mobil, bought half of Nobel Brothers' Russian oil assets for $7-9 million, betting on the Soviet state's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Despite negotiations for concessions in Baku and Grozny, major deals with companies like Standard Oil and Sinclair Oil Corporation never materialized, largely due to U.S. government pressure and its view of the Soviet regime as illegitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Post-Revolution Recovery and WWII Impact
Despite the failure of large foreign concessions, the Soviets began to drill again on their own, with production surging from 4.2 million metric tons in 1921 to 6.3 million in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This recovery was aided by British equipment from companies like Shell Vickers, which, despite suffering losses from nationalization, opted to sell turbines and modern oil drilling equipment to the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

The Soviets paid Vickers with a percentage of their foreign oil sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, making oil one of the country's few profitable export sectors by 1926 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. However, for a long time, the Soviets did not prioritize oil for domestic use, focusing instead on hydropower, electrification, and coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. They viewed oil as too expensive and rare, even investigating coal liquefaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

On the eve of World War II, the [[soviet_oil_strategy_during_world_war_ii | Soviet oil industry]] was stagnant and underfunded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. The Nazi German invasion (Operation Barbarossa) in June 1941, driven by Germany's need for oil, changed this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. In 1942, after failing to capture Moscow, the Germans devised "Case Blue" to seize the oil-rich cities of the Caucasus, including Baku and Grozny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Logistical issues and winter conditions halted German forces far short of these targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

Expecting German arrival, the Red Army evacuated personnel and machinery, including drilling equipment, pipelines, and entire refineries, to the Volga-Ural area, which became known as the "Second Baku" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. As a result, oil production in the Caucasus was devastated, dropping by over 50% in a single year to levels not seen since the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. The Americans assisted by disassembling and sending six refineries to the Volga-Ural area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. Stalin himself stressed the importance of petroleum, calling it "the soul of military equipment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

### Post-War Expansion and the Rise to Power
The war taught the Soviets the crucial importance of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. After it ended, they sought to control as much oil as possible, occupying Romania and temporarily Austria to secure oil imports until the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. The Red Army also confiscated Western oil technologies as war booty to revitalize production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

Throughout the 1950s, the Soviets heavily invested in developing the oil fields of the Volga-Ural Basin, shifting priority away from Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. By the end of the 1950s, massive fields like Romashkino (4,200 sq km) were producing more oil than the rest of the country combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The Volga-Ural Basin remains a significant oil production area today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

## Soviet Oil in the 1960s and Beyond
From its early days, the [[Soviet Union]] harnessed its natural resources for survival and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Oil and gas were instrumental in Lenin's industrialization efforts and fueled the Red Army's victory in World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

As production expanded, the Soviets began exporting energy, initially to earn foreign currency for goods like wheat, meat, or advanced technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Over time, these energy exports evolved into a tool for wielding political influence, serving as leverage to keep satellite states and allies in line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. This strategic use of oil contributed to the [[economic_impact_of_oil_production_on_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union]] becoming an [[soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | energy superpower]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. This tributary arrangement eventually played a role in the [[challenges_faced_by_the_soviet_economy_in_its_later_years | Soviet Union's ultimate downfall]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

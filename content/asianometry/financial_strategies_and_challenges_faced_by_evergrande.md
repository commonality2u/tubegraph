Evergrande Group, a sprawling company with billions of dollars in debt, has recently faced a significant cash crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Once China's biggest real estate conglomerate, it now has $300 billion in liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The company's rise and fall illustrate a unique set of financial strategies and the challenges that ultimately led to its precarious position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Early Growth and the "Three Highs, One Low" Strategy

Evergrande was founded in 1997 by Xu Jiayin (also known as Shu Jain) as a real estate company in Guangzhou <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Its initial strategy for growth was characterized by the slogan "San Gao Yi Di," meaning "three highs, one low" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Initial Funding and Rapid Turnover
Xu Jiayin faced competition from established developers like Vanke, Dalian Wanda Group, and Country Garden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. His first project, Jinbe Garden, was built on a problematic plot of land acquired at an extremely low price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Unable to afford the required 5 million RMB down payment, Evergrande convinced the government to allow installments and borrowed 6 million RMB from a bank, using 5 million for the down payment and 1 million to kick off construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

The company implemented a strategy of:
*   **Low Cost, High Value Design**: Selling units at 2800 RMB per square meter ($40 USD per square foot) or below cost, making premium real estate accessible to the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **High Turnover**: Jinbe Garden units sold out in two hours, generating 80 million RMB ($12 million USD) in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Reinvestment**: Sales from each round were quickly reinvested into more land purchases and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

This allowed Evergrande to immediately begin development on 13 other projects simultaneously in Guangzhou <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. By 1999, just two years after founding, it was Guangzhou's seventh-largest real estate company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### The "Three Highs, One Low" Explained
The company's strategy involved:
*   **High Debt**: Accumulating significant debt to acquire massive land banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **High Leverage**: Using borrowed money extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **High Turnover**: Quickly building and selling units to generate cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Low Cost**: Keeping development and sales costs low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

This strategy meant Evergrande operated on a "razor's edge," relying on rising land prices to stay ahead of its debt costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Understanding Evergrande's Liabilities

As of 2020, Evergrande had about 1.95 trillion RMB ($300 billion USD) in liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. It's crucial to understand the nature of these liabilities:
*   **Customer Deposits**: A significant portion comes from deposits from customers for future homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Unlike bank deposits (e.g., JPMorgan Chase), these are not the same as checking accounts, and the risk of a forced withdrawal is much higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Current Liabilities**: Over 50% of what Evergrande owes is classified as current, meaning it might need to be repaid within a year or an operating cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This poses a significant risk if the company faces a period where it needs to "cough up cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Off-Balance Sheet Issues**: Evergrande Group has various subsidiaries not listed on the main group's books because the group doesn't own 51% of their stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. However, these entities represent themselves as Evergrande companies, and their debts are implicitly backed by the main group through "unspoken agreements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. The full extent of these hidden liabilities is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

## Challenges and Diversification

### The 2008 Global Financial Crisis
The 2008 crisis initiated fears of a real estate downturn in China, leaving Evergrande in "turbulent waters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. The company, in the midst of national expansion with 37 projects, faced cash flow problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. With 12 to 15 billion RMB ($2 billion USD) in debt, its original plan to go public in Hong Kong was thwarted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

Xu Jiayin sought help from friends, eventually securing a bailout from investors like Cheng Yu-tung of Chao Tai Fook Group, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and the Kuwait Investment Authority, totaling $500 million USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This allowed the company to stabilize, leading to a successful IPO in November 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

### [[evergrandes_diversification_and_investment_ventures | Diversification Efforts]]
A year after its IPO, Evergrande began to diversify beyond real estate, driven by Xu Jiayin's ambition to build an empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **Guangzhou Football Club**: In 2010, Evergrande acquired the Guangzhou Football (soccer) Club for 100 million RMB ($15 million USD), bringing it significant success, including seven straight Chinese Super League championships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Consumer Goods (Mineral Water)**: In 2013, Evergrande launched its mineral water product, Evergrande Bingqian, with ambitious sales targets of 10 billion RMB in 2014 and 30 billion RMB by 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. However, the brand struggled and was not profitable, despite high gross margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Evergrande eventually sold its shares in the mineral water business in 2016, along with other food products, for 2.7 billion RMB ($405 million USD) while offloading 3.3 billion RMB ($510 million USD) in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **"Diversity Plus Scale Plus Brand"**: In mid-2014, Xu Jiayin unveiled a new strategy, "diversity plus scale plus brand," aiming to diversify beyond real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This included acquiring Yen-chen Plastic Surgery clinics, run by Xu's wife Yang Huaying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   **High-Tech and Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: In 2018, in response to US technology export sanctions on ZTE, Xu Jiayin announced Evergrande's entry into the high-tech industry, including quantum computing, AI, life sciences, and new energy vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Evergrande committed 45 billion RMB ($7 billion USD) over three years to develop EVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. The company repurposed its Hong Kong-listed health company, Evergrande Health Industry Group, renaming it Evergrande Auto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. By April 2021, Evergrande Auto was valued at nearly $90 billion, more than Ford Motors, despite not having sold a single car and losing billions of RMB annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. This "bubble" eventually burst, and the stock crashed by over 95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

## Strategy Shift to "Three Lows, One High"

In early 2017, with total liabilities of 1.15 trillion RMB ($178 billion USD), Xu Jiayin announced a complete reversal of Evergrande's strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. The new strategy, "San Di Yi Gao" (three lows, one high), aimed for:
*   **Low Debt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>
*   **Low Leverage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>
*   **Low Cost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>
*   **High Turnover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>

The goal was to lower debt ratios and raise total net assets, aligning with the [[chinese_governments_response_and_regulations_affecting_evergrande | Chinese government's pronouncements on de-leveraging the economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Evergrande undertook debt reduction measures, selling assets and raising investment funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Despite claims of declining net debt ratios, total liabilities actually rose from 1.1 trillion RMB ($170 billion USD) in 2016 to 1.5 trillion RMB ($232 billion USD) in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

## The "Three Red Lines" Regulation and Crisis

The [[chinese_governments_response_and_regulations_affecting_evergrande | Chinese government]], concerned about contagion threats from highly leveraged conglomerates, introduced the "three red lines" regulation in August 2020 after interviews with 12 real estate companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. These regulations set caps on key financial metrics:
1.  **Liabilities to Assets Ratio**: A ceiling of 70% (excluding advances from contracted projects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
2.  **Net Debt to Equity Ratio**: A cap of 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
3.  **Cash to Short-Term Borrowings**: A requirement to hold at least one dollar of cash for each dollar borrowed in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

Companies failing to meet these requirements would not be allowed to add more debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. Evergrande's metrics at the time were far beyond these limits:
*   Liabilities to Asset Ratio: 82% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>
*   Net Debt to Equity Ratio: 199% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>
*   Cash to Short-Term Borrowings: 0.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>

This caught Evergrande off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. In response, Xu Jiayin announced a 30% price cut on 600 new builds nationwide to achieve sales of 100 billion RMB ($15.4 billion USD) each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

### The Leaked Letter and Recent Turmoil
In September 2020, a leaked letter from Evergrande to the Guangdong provincial government, titled "Report on Requesting Support for Major Asset Restructuring Projects," revealed the depth of its financial distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. The letter stated that interest-bearing liabilities had reached about 835 billion RMB ($130 billion USD), owed to 128 domestic banks and 121 non-banking entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. It highlighted a critical deadline: if a planned reorganization was not completed by February 2021, Evergrande would owe strategic investors 130 billion RMB ($20 billion USD) plus 13.7 billion RMB ($2.2 billion USD) in dividends, risking a severe cash flow crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.

Since then, the company has faced debt downgrades, and its shares have dropped over 68%, with debt losing over half its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. While Evergrande possesses significant assets (1.9 trillion RMB) on its balance sheet, much of this is in land banks or houses under construction, which have limited value unless vendors and construction crews are paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

Further concerns arose from Evergrande Wealth Management fund products, high-yielding interest products predominantly sold to employees who then resold them to friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. With about 40 billion RMB ($6.2 billion USD) of these products outstanding, two affiliates missed repayments in September 2021, leading to protests at Evergrande's headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>. Evergrande announced repayment through cash, payment in kind (land), or credit for future home purchases, though many investors remained unhappy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

On August 17, 2021, Xu Jiayin resigned as Evergrande's chairman, with Zhao Tanglong stepping up as his successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. The situation remains ongoing, with questions about a potential government bailout, the impact on real estate markets, and whether the government can contain the damage from off-balance sheet liabilities to prevent a systemic crisis of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

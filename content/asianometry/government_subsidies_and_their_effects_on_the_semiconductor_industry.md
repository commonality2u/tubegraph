Governments worldwide are increasingly investing in the semiconductor industry through subsidies, driven by national sovereignty concerns and a desire to bring manufacturing capabilities onshore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This trend is leading to a significant build-out of new fabrication plants (fabs) globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Global Initiatives

Several major economies have announced substantial investments in their domestic semiconductor industries:
*   **China** is implementing a $20 billion semiconductor plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **The United States** has proposed $50 billion in President Joe Biden's stimulus plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **The European Union** is allocating 145 billion euros towards establishing a 2-nanometer cutting-edge fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## [[us_semiconductor_industry_subsidies | US Semiconductor Industry Subsidies]]

In the United States, two significant pieces of legislation, the CHIPS Act and the American Foundries Act, are in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. These acts aim to:
*   Establish an R&D fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   Provide a 20-40% tax credit for the acquisition of semiconductor production equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

The tax credit is expected to have a more short-term impact, influencing the industry for approximately three to five years, or one fab generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Conversely, the R&D fund is anticipated to yield longer-term effects, especially in fostering public-private partnerships, similar to the one that led to the development of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Effects and Criticisms of Subsidies

Subsidies, by their nature, create market distortions, which is their intended purposeâ€”to attract more manufacturing to the USA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. A 40% subsidy can effectively achieve this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

However, a key consideration is whether these subsidies will be permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. If not, the subsidized fabs will eventually need to become self-sustaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The renewal of these credits might face increased scrutiny once current chip shortages are resolved and politically influential industries, such as automakers, no longer face supply issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Impact on Global Investments and Capacity
The current wave of subsidies is contributing to a significant global build-out of fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Examples include:
*   TSMC's Arizona fab, which has been underway for a year and may be upscaled from its original plan of a 20,000 wafer fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This facility could eventually produce 25,000 to 100,000 wafer starts per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   Samsung's negotiations for a multi-billion dollar investment to expand its Austin fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   Smaller, second-tier foundries are also expanding or upgrading their capacity, with many press releases from companies not under 10nm process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   Global Foundries is investing $1.4 billion in expansion and moving up its IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   SMIC is receiving $2.35 billion from the Shenzhen government for a project expected to produce 40,000 wafers a month by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

These [[global_investments_in_semiconductor_fabs | global investments in semiconductor fabs]] are expected to bring hundreds of thousands of additional wafers to the market over the next one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This raises questions about whether demand, which surged during the pandemic, will sustain such a significant increase in supply, especially as people return to offices and schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The U.S. Department of Defense's annual purchase of 1.9 billion semiconductors is a small fraction compared to the theoretical monthly output of a single large fab like TSMC's Arizona facility, which could produce 3.5 billion dies per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

The extensive capacity build-out, partly fueled by government subsidies, leads to a significant amount of new capacity entering the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This could inevitably lead to an end to the current boom and a return to a bust cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

At the time of Japan's opening, most of the world's watches originated from either the United States or Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While the Swiss tried to safeguard their manufacturing secrets, these secrets eventually diffused, leading to Japan becoming a significant global watch producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This article explores the initial development, ascent, and peak of [[history_of_japanese_watchmaking | Japanese watchmaking]].

## Global Watch Market at the Turn of the Century

Around the turn of the century, the watch market was largely divided between the United States and Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **United States:** A few large companies like Waltham Watch and Elgin Watch mass-produced hundreds of thousands of simple, affordable pocket watches for domestic use, utilizing screw automation technology adapted from sewing machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Switzerland:** The [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss watch industry]] was characterized by numerous small companies producing a wide array of high-precision timepieces, primarily for export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. In 1901, Swiss statistics showed 663 watch industry firms employing nearly 25,000 people, with the largest company, Longines, employing just 853 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Switzerland dominated the pocket watch export market with approximately 93% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Early Japanese Clock Industry Development

Japan, driven by an overarching goal of modernization and catching up with the West, rapidly adopted Western technologies for areas like railroads, telegraphs, and the military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. When Westerners began importing watches into Japan in the 1860s, they were initially seen as luxury items for the social elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

By 1887, over 700,000 clocks had entered Japan, installed in hospitals, schools, town halls, and post offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. As clocks were technologically simpler than watches, Japan initially focused on replicating them to reduce reliance on imports from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

In 1888, Hayashi Shii, a timepiece retailer, established Japan's first modern clock factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This initiative was successful, leading Hayashi to open five more factories in various cities including Osaka and Tokyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Japan's clock industry quickly gained proficiency, with production rising from 37,460 pieces in 1905 to 1.2 million in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. By the eve of World War I, there were over 20 clock factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Initially, domestic and military demand fueled this market, but Hayashi soon exported excess production to Far Eastern cities like Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Bombay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. By the 1930s, Japan became a major clock exporter, holding 35% of the total market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## The Rise of Japanese Watchmaking Companies

As pocket watches grew in popularity—from 0.8% of Japanese regularly wearing them in 1887 to 10% in 1907 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>—Japanese companies began to manufacture them.

### Hattori Kintaro and Seiko

The most prominent early Japanese watch company was Hattori & Co., founded by Hattori Kintaro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Hattori learned the watch industry from age 13 at a Tokyo clock dealership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. In 1877, at 17, he opened his own shop for repairing and reselling watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. After marrying a watch trader's daughter in 1881, he purchased a shop from his father-in-law and began selling imported Swiss and American watches, sourcing them from Swiss trading houses in Yokohama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

Seeing the opportunity during the Japanese clock boom, Hattori opened his own factory, named Seikosha, in 1895, initially producing wall clocks and high-end grandfather clocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

Initially, Japanese watches struggled to compete with Swiss and American companies, being less thin, accurate, or reliable, and costing more due to a lack of economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This was partly due to an "unequal treaty" signed in the mid-1800s between Japan and the United States, which opened several treaty ports and allowed free import of Western goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Government Protectionism and "Shablon" Strategy

In 1899, this treaty lapsed, and Japan regained sovereignty over its trade relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The Japanese government immediately implemented an import substitution policy, raising tariffs to protect domestic manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Tariffs on silver and nickel watch imports, which were 5% before 1899, rose to 25% and then 40% in 1906 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Similar actions were taken for bicycles, machine tools, hydroelectric turbines, and automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

Protected from Western imports, Hattori's watchmaking business boomed. From 1906 to 1930, his clocks captured 48% of the domestic market, and his watches, 85% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Hattori's company improved manufacturing capacity by focusing on automating a small number of select Swiss-inspired models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Between 1895 and 1937, out of 25 watch types released, only three sold well: the 1909 Empire pocket watch, and two wristwatches, the Laurel and the [[Seiko]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

To gain expertise, Hattori hired engineering labor from Tokyo universities to disassemble Swiss watches and reassemble them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Crucially, he sourced raw watch parts from Switzerland, which were not subject to tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. From 1915 to 1935, Switzerland supplied 69% of Japan's watch parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This practice of importing disassembled watch movement sets (known as "shablon") and assembling them within Japan was instrumental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

From 1895 to 1899, Japan imported 22,500 watch movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. However, in 1900, the first year of tariffs on finished watches, imports surged to 122,000 movements, and by 1905, to 250,000, far exceeding finished watch imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

The Swiss [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | watch industry]] correctly feared that "shablon" would lead to their long-term downfall by transferring critical watchmaking expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. For example, Rudolph Schmidt, a Swiss citizen who settled in Yokohama in 1894, initially imported complete watches but shifted to importing "shablon" after Japan raised tariffs in 1908 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. By 1910, Schmidt had moved the entire watchmaking process, including case making, to Japan, infuriating the Swiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. In 1930, Schmidt acquired a workshop, which was renamed the [[Citizen Watch Company]], destined to become Japan's second major watchmaker after Hattori & Co. (Seiko) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

By 1935, Hattori's watch factory became the single largest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Both Hattori and Citizen began expanding abroad, promoting their watches as "Japanese made" and highlighting Japanese workers' "extraordinary aptitude for any type of fine painstaking work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Facing declining watch exports in the 1920s, the Swiss reorganized their industry into a cartel, making "shablon" illegal and controlling all watchmaking activities and exports of parts and machine tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This ensured high profits and a consistent 50% global market share for the Swiss for several decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## The Quartz Revolution and Japanese Dominance

The 1930s also saw a market shift from pocket watches to wristwatches, with new features like self-winding movements, calendars, and waterproof cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. World War II largely halted watch production outside Switzerland, which remained neutral, giving them a global market advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. American watch companies struggled post-war against cheap Swiss imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

Hattori & Co. diligently worked to overcome the post-war slump and compete with the Swiss. They copied Swiss machine tools, studied Swiss methods during trips to Europe, and exploited loopholes in the Swiss cartel system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. By 1966, Hattori was producing mechanical watches that matched Swiss quality, establishing themselves as world leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

However, at the same time, the company aimed to introduce a new type of watch that would revolutionize the mechanical watch world: the quartz watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Development of the Quartz Watch

The principles of quartz technology were long known; Pierre Curie discovered in the 1880s that quartz crystals vibrate consistently when pressure or alternating current is applied, specifically at 33,000 times per second, offering far greater accuracy than mechanical clocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. In 1927, Bell Labs created a high-precision, room-sized quartz clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

In 1960, American watchmaker Bulova launched the Accutron, the first commercial electronic watch, using a 360 Hz tuning fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. It was ten times more accurate than mechanical watches and used fewer parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Although Bulova stuck with tuning fork technology, the Accutron spurred technological development in electronic watches across the US, Japan, and Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

In 1959, Hattori (now [[Seiko]]) formed a team to commercialize quartz timekeepers, leveraging the transistor's ability to power quartz crystals and translate oscillations into precise second pulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Their initial goal was a portable quartz chronometer for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. After achieving this, they focused on miniaturizing the technology into a wristwatch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

The resulting [[Seiko Astron SQ]], though a "mishmash of ill-fitting components" and using a hand-soldered hybrid circuit, was groundbreaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. [[Seiko]] outsourced some complex production to American firm Interel and tapped Japanese producers like Hitachi, NEC, and Toshiba for transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

The [[Seiko Astron SQ]] went on sale in Tokyo on Christmas Day 1969, priced at what would be $31,000 today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. [[Seiko]] marketed it with the prophetic line, "Someday all watches will be made this way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

### Digital Watches and Market Shift

While the Astron was revolutionary, early sales were modest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Another development came from Hamilton Watch in Pennsylvania, which used light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to create the Pulsar, a "wrist computer" that displayed time digitally, released in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. It gained popularity when James Bond wore a P2 version in *Live and Let Die* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

By the mid-1970s, LED quartz watches became the market standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, with sales predicted to reach 10 million in a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. These were soon superseded by LCD watches due to better battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

Various integrated circuit firms and traditional watch companies, including Texas Instruments and even Intel (which acquired digital watchmaker Microma in 1972), entered the digital quartz watch category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. [[Casio]], originally a calculator company, competed directly with US firm Timex at the low end, selling affordable models in drugstores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

## Japanese Dominance in the Quartz Era

Japanese watch exports to the United States, a critical market, exploded. Export value grew nearly tenfold, reaching $26 million USD by 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>, with watches accounting for almost 20% of total Japanese exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. By 1985, Japanese watch exports to the US totaled $373 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

The [[impact_of_quartz_technology_on_the_watch_industry | impact of quartz technology]] led to the [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss watch industry's dominance and decline]]. Swiss exports stagnated, and their market share plummeted from 83% in the early 1970s to just 20% by 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. By 1983, over half of Switzerland's watchmakers had gone bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. [[Seiko]], [[Citizen Watch Company]], and [[Casio]] had effectively displaced the Swiss from their most valuable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

### Key Factors in Japanese Success:
*   **Technological Adaptability:** Despite the Swiss being aware of quartz technology and even demonstrating prototypes before the Astron, they prioritized their mechanical heritage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Japan, unburdened by such legacy, fully embraced the technological shift.
*   **Industrial Structure:** The Swiss industry's decentralized structure of many small firms hindered their ability to develop and scale quartz production, unlike the more integrated Japanese companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Efficiency:** Digital watches, made with modern semiconductor production methods, offered titanic scale and overwhelmed the human training and painstaking effort required for mechanical watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[impact of quartz technology on the watch industry]] significantly altered the global landscape. While the [[swiss_watch_industrys_dominance_and_decline | Swiss watch industry]] eventually recovered by focusing on luxury mechanical watches, the [[history_of_japanese_watchmaking | Japanese watch industry]] peaked in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. Subsequently, it faced challenges from industrial competitors in Hong Kong and China, leading to stagnation and relocation of manufacturing abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. The Japanese industry has since struggled to return to its glory years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

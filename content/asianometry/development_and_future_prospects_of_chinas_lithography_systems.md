Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) is China's ambitious project aimed at replacing [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] in the [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The company has garnered significant attention in Chinese media, particularly with recent high-profile export bans to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Early Development of Lithography in China

China's first [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] machine, the GK3, was created in 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Two years later, it evolved into the JKG3, which became the first domestically created [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] machine for large-scale commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

In 1978, the GK4 prototype was developed; it was a contact [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] machine capable of printing chips on 75 millimeter wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Contact [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] involves direct contact between the photomask and the photoresist-coated substrate, which is known for high defect rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. At this point, China was two decades behind the United States, which invented and commercialized contact [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Subsequently, China simultaneously attempted to develop proximity aligners and step-and-scan devices (steppers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   In 1981, the Institute of Semiconductors of the Chinese Academy of Sciences successfully developed two proximity aligner prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   In 1985, after six years of work, the 45th Institute of the Ministry of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering developed their own stepper, "inspired" by the US-based GCA 4800 DSW, which printed designs using the 436 nanometer G-line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   By 2000, China began research on machines utilizing argon fluoride lasers on the 193 nanometer wavelength, but a significant technology gap remained as Western companies had been shipping such devices since 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Founding of SMEE and National Goals

SMEE was founded in March 2002, indicating a shift in government strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. China's 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015) included 16 major national special projects, with [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] ranked as the second highest priority, leading to its designation as the "Zero Two Special Project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

The "Zero Two Special Project" had several key objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>:
*   Develop manufacturing equipment capable of producing 22 to 45 nanometer processed chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   Conduct forward research on 14 to 22 nanometer processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   Work on 65 to 90 nanometer special processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Capture at least 10 percent of the domestic [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   Attempt to open up the international market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

SMEE was designated as the national champion responsible for achieving these goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The company's first office was located in the Shanghai Zhangjiang High-Tech Park, sharing the neighborhood with semiconductor companies like SMIC, Grace Semiconductor, and Spreadtrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Ha Rongming, SMEE's founding general manager and chairman, was noted for his intense dedication to the task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

SMEE has developed its products through extensive R&D, filing over 3,000 patents by 2019 and receiving 1,600, with nearly 700 patents in foreign countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The company has received significant support from both local and central Chinese governments, with the Shanghai SASAC (the commission overseeing the city's corporate assets) being its largest owner at 32% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## SMEE's Strategy and Market Penetration

Due to import restrictions on high-level optics from companies like Carl Zeiss, SMEE initially targeted areas of the [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] market with less intense competition and stricter requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This focus included [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] for advanced packaging processes, which involves placing chips in protective casings and connecting them to the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This strategy allowed SMEE to gain experience in back-end [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] before moving to front-end [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

SMEE's products now hold 80% of the domestic back-end [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] market, corresponding to 40% of the global market in 2019, having shipped over 50 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Major back-end customers include Changjiang Electric Group, Taiwan-based ASE Group, and Tongfu Microelectronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. SMEE has also expanded into [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] tools for other niche semiconductor products like power devices, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), and LEDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The company eventually began developing front-end tools for companies like Yangtze Memory and SMIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## Challenges and Technological Gaps

Unlike its Japanese competitors Canon and Nikon, SMEE is structured after the [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] model, aiming to be the final system integrator for [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] tools, relying on various suppliers for parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Key success factors for a [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] machine include high-precision optics, the light source, high-precision mechanics, and software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Core Components and Suppliers

SMEE faces significant [[challenges_faced_by_china_in_developing_lithography_technology | challenges]] in securing domestic suppliers for critical components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>:
*   **Optics**: SMEE's Carl Zeiss equivalent is Beijing Guowang Technology Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Beijing Guowang is in the process of building an optics manufacturing factory, so it is not expected to supply immersion-ready optical systems in mass until after September 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   **Light Source**: SMEE's equivalent to [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]]'s Cymer is Beijing RS Laser Opto-Electronics Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. RS Laser's product is currently underpowered compared to what [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] uses for its immersion systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Other Critical Components**: Many core technologies must still be imported or purchased from foreign companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. For example, the vast majority of photomasks (plates holding chip patterns) are made by Japanese companies like Toppan Printing and Dai Nippon Printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Other essential imported components include ball bearings from Sweden, valves from France, and grating alignment systems from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Current Status of SMEE's Lithography Systems

As of August 2021, SMEE's systems are available for 90 nanometer, 110 nanometer, and 280 nanometer processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. These are specialized systems primarily for back-end [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]], LED, MEMS, and power devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Most SMEE systems use I-line and Krypton Fluoride lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

SMEE's most advanced system, the SSA 600-20 scanner for front-end manufacturing at the 90 nanometer node, uses an argon fluoride (ArF) laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. A prototype, the 600-10, was first profiled in 2011, with a field size of 22mm x 32mm and a processing capability of about 50 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This is significantly slower than comparable Canon and Nikon machines, which can process up to five times that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. As of 2019, the SSA 600-20 was not selling in relevant quantities, with the company's recent sales still being in outdated I-line [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

## Future Prospects and Prototypes

The most prominent news about SMEE's future pipeline is an argon fluoride immersion (ArFi) system, projected to be capable of the 28 nanometer process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This 28 nanometer tool is currently a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. China typically builds prototypes that lag the leading edge by about 10 years, which aligns with the 28 nanometer node first shipping around 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

The primary [[challenges_faced_by_china_in_developing_lithography_technology | challenge]] lies in transitioning from prototype to high-volume commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. China has historically struggled to turn prototypes into commercially competitive products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. While the goal is to deliver commercial-ready 28 nanometer ArFi machines in 2021 or 2022, this deadline is likely to be missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Beijing Guowang, SMEE's critical optics supplier, is building a foundry for optical systems, but its construction is not expected to be completed until September 2023, making a 2024 ship date ambitious and the product unlikely to be commercially competitive even then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

## Discrepancy Between Hype and Reality

Chinese news sources tend to exaggerate headlines regarding technological achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. For example, in November 2018, the Institute of Opto-Electronics Technology announced a "super-resolution" [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] tool capable of 22 nanometer resolution, with claims that multi-patterning could achieve process nodes below 10 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. However, this tool is not commercially ready, has low accuracy, and a very small field of view (a few square millimeters), meaning it would take an extremely long time to process a single wafer layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. In contrast, [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]]'s Twinscan NXT:1970Ci, a comparable DUV machine capable of 38 nanometer nodes and below, offers a field of view of 858 square millimeters and can process over 250 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

Chinese press often refers to the [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | photolithography]] effort as the "Mount Everest of the intelligent manufacturing industry," characterized by "steadfast cheerleading and rah-rah optimism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. One commonly cited example of this rhetoric includes statements about China's historical wisdom and achievements, asserting that "there is nothing that can't be done by us Chinese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

However, the reality is that SMEE is at least 20 years behind [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] in bringing a commercial-ready upper-class [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] device to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Immersion [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] is only nascent, and [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] is even farther away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Even Chinese sources acknowledge this reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Such optimistic rhetoric can be counterproductive, leading to pessimism when deadlines are missed and preventing a realistic assessment of the problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

## Human Capital Challenges

A significant issue for SMEE is human capital. While Chinese companies are known for offering large sums to engineers, this doesn't seem to apply to SMEE when compared to [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   Entry-level college graduates at SMEE make about $45,000 USD per year, with PhDs making roughly twice that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   SMEE's average PhD salary is comparable to [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]]'s company-wide average salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] offers significantly higher pay for staff software engineers (nearly $200,000 USD/year) and comprehensive benefits including share purchase plans, pension plans, commuting allowances, 40 days of paid leave, and holiday allowances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

SMEE is unlikely to match [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]]'s generosity in benefits due to its much smaller capital base compared to [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]]'s $300 billion valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. As a "national champion" with expectations on par with Huawei, SMEE has adopted Huawei's working practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This includes long working hours, considerable political intervention, tough annual assessments for bonuses, and annual layoffs of the bottom 5-10% of employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This approach may hinder SMEE's ability to acquire and retain top talent compared to [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]], which focuses on employee development and retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## Conclusion

While SMEE faces substantial [[challenges_faced_by_china_in_developing_lithography_technology | challenges]] and lags significantly behind leading companies like [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] in advanced front-end [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]], progress in back-end [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] and LED [[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | lithography]] is promising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Some Chinese companies have also built strong track records in specific semiconductor equipment areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. SMEE is reportedly considering an IPO in the future, with potential valuations in the $5-10 billion range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. An IPO would release new information, potentially providing more insight into the company's prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

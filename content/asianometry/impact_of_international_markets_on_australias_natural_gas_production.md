Australia has emerged as a significant player in the global natural gas market, becoming the world's leading exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. In that year alone, the country exported $25 billion worth of natural gas, primarily to markets in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This rise to prominence is a result of abundant natural gas reserves, complex energy politics, and the evolving demands of international trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Historical Context and Early Policies

Historically, Australia's export focus was on coal, with natural gas production reserved for domestic use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Australians began mining coal in the 1800s and started exporting it after World War II, making the country the world's second-biggest coal exporter today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. When the first commercial gas field came online in the 1960s, natural gas was seen as a premium, low-pollutant fuel for electricity generation and industry, especially compared to coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Australia possesses significant proven natural gas reserves, estimated at about 3 trillion cubic meters in conventional reserves, potentially rising to 12 trillion cubic meters if unconventional gas fields like coal seam gas and shale gas are included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. However, approximately 80% of conventional gas resources are concentrated in the northwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

A major challenge for natural gas is transportation, as reserves are often far from population centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. While pipelines are economical for shorter distances, they lack flexibility and can be politically controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. For longer distances (beyond 700 miles overseas or 2,200 miles on land), LNG becomes more economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Cooling natural gas to -260Â°F turns it into a liquid, reducing its volume by 1/600th and making it easier to transport via tanker ships or trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The main drawback of LNG is the high upfront cost of building expensive liquefaction plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

Despite being a very large country, Australia lacks an integrated nationwide gas pipeline system, operating instead with three largely separate regional markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This fragmented system, due to physical distance and varying regulatory regimes, contributes to [[transportation_and_infrastructure_issues_related_to_natural_gas_in_australia | national energy security problems]], as gas cannot easily be moved from areas of abundance to areas of need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

In the 1960s and 1970s, new gas discoveries, particularly in Central Australia, attracted foreign interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This sparked economic nationalism, leading the right-leaning federal government in 1970 to impose a general export embargo on LNG to prioritize domestic requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## The Northwest Shelf Venture and the Shift to Export

The **Northwest Shelf Venture** project, a joint venture involving Australian companies (Woodside Petroleum, Mid-Eastern Oil) and foreign multinationals (Burma Oil, Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, California Asiatic Oil), received a license to explore northwest Australia in the mid-1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. After years of little success, natural gas was discovered at Scott Reef in 1971, followed by additional large discoveries at North Rankin and Goodwin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. These fields were estimated to hold over 300 billion cubic meters of natural gas, far exceeding the needs of the Western Australian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

The venture partners planned a massive $12 billion project to develop these resources, build an LNG plant, and export LNG to the world market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. However, the nationwide natural gas export ban remained in effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The left-wing federal government at the time also expressed resentment towards foreign multinational involvement, requesting at least 50% local ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Despite Woodside being Australian, the project required foreign funds and expertise to fully exploit the resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The Western Australian market was too small to justify the billions needed for development without export opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The distance and lack of an integrated pipeline system also meant connecting to Australia's other markets was not economically feasible for private actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

A political shift in 1975 brought a more right-leaning, business-friendly government to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This new regime was more eager to see energy projects proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The local ownership threshold was naturally met when Burma Oil sold its stake to the Australian mining giant BHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. In 1977, the federal government lifted its export embargo, allowing the Northwest Shelf Venture to move forward, with the condition that domestic requirements were considered first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The project was initially allowed to export 50% of its gas production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The new government also introduced tax benefits, including an extended investment allowance, an income tax rebate, and waived oil and resource taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

In 1978, the venture secured deals with eight large Japanese customers to supply [[economic_and_renewable_energy_implications_for_australia_and_southeast_asia | Japan]] with LNG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Buoyed by favorable oil market conditions following the Iranian Revolution, construction began in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The Northwest Shelf Venture became Australia's largest project to date and, for a time, the world's single biggest engineering project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. It included offshore platforms, undersea pipelines, a massive LNG plant capable of processing 12 million tons of natural gas annually, LNG tankers, and a pipeline to Perth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The first LNG exports to Japan commenced in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Japan has remained a regular customer, later joined by the People's Republic of China, with the two countries together purchasing 75% of Australia's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Coal Seam Gas and Continued Export Growth

The success of the Northwest Shelf Project, along with the subsequent Gorgon Gas Project, has led to over $25 billion invested in Western Australia's gas fields, which still hold about 80% of Australia's proven reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. The project legally reserves a significant portion of production for domestic use in Western Australia, where natural gas supplies 64% of the state's energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

While Western Australia benefits, Australia's northern and eastern markets, particularly the eastern market which includes major cities like Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Hobart, face bigger supply [[challenges_of_domestic_natural_gas_shortages_in_australia | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Australia's domestic energy demand is growing rapidly, with consumption increasing by about 0.6% annually, driven by industrial demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

This growing demand, alongside the limited conventional gas fields in the southern and eastern regions, incentivized the development of unconventional natural gas, specifically coal seam gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. These regions possess large coal deposits with significant methane trapped within their seams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Companies like Conoco Australia, Mitsubishi, and Houston Oil and Minerals attempted to harness this methane in the 1970s and 80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. In 1996, BHP successfully broke through at the Bowen Basin in Queensland, initiating a coal seam gas boom in eastern Australia that led to a ninefold increase in gas production for the domestic eastern market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. State governments further supported this by pushing for a switch from coal to gas, such as the Queensland Gas Scheme in 2005, which mandated electricity retailers produce 13-15% of their electricity from gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

Despite the Bowen Basin's potential to serve eastern markets for many years, export markets again beckoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. The Queensland state government approved three consortia to build LNG plants and export coal seam gas to Asian markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. The first of these, operated by Santos, came online in December 2014, followed by APLNG in January 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Today, three LNG plants on Curtis Island collectively produce 26 million tons of LNG annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. Eastern Australia's proximity to Asia provides a price advantage for its LNG exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

In 2020, Australia dethroned Qatar to become the world's leading LNG exporter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Australia's rise as a natural gas export power, combined with its reputation as a reliably Western-aligned country, has significantly helped stabilize global energy markets, making its natural gas exports more crucial than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. However, this export success coexists with domestic energy shortages and rising prices, impeding growth and causing political challenges at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Solving this dilemma requires a coherent nationwide strategy, including ideas like a transcontinental pipeline and a gas reservation policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

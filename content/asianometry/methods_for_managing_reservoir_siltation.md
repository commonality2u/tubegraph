Reservoir silting, or sedimentation, is a constant concern for water infrastructure worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Each year, 1-2% of the world's hydropower capacity is lost to river silt and sediment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Silting slowly erodes a dam's capacity to store drinking water, generate power, and protect from flooding, necessitating expensive preventive measures and interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Understanding Reservoir Silting

Rivers transport two primary types of sediment:
*   **Coarse sediment** consists of sands and gravels, typically originating from the riverbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Fine-grained sediment** includes smaller particles, around two millimeters wide, which can come from the riverbed or from clay and silt washed into the river by rain or human activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The total amount of sediment carried by a river is measured as "sediment yield," expressed in units like tons per year per square kilometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

When a river is dammed to create a reservoir, its natural sediment transport is interrupted, causing sediments to settle within the reservoir and eventually fill it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This situation, known as reservoir sedimentation or silting, reduces the reservoir's water-carrying capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The lost storage due to silting is referred to as "dead storage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Taiwan's reservoirs are particularly affected by silting due to its mountainous geography with loose soils and frequent, prolonged typhoon storms that sweep these soils into rivers, significantly increasing sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For example, Typhoon Morakot in 2009 deposited an estimated 90 million cubic meters of sediment into the Zengwen Reservoir, Taiwan's largest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### [[consequences_of_ignoring_reservoir_maintenance | Consequences of Silting]]

Beyond the reduction in water and hydropower capacity, reservoir silting has several other negative [[effects_of_silt_and_sediment_on_reservoirs | consequences]]:
*   **Navigation Impediment** Sediment accumulation makes it difficult for boats to carry cargo and reach dam locks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Health Hazards** When dried, accumulated sediment can become airborne, leading to dust storms and health issues for nearby residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Damage to Hydropower Infrastructure**
    *   Coarse sediments erode turbine runner blades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   They abrade gate seals and spillways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   They clog intake valves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   During Hurricane David in 1979, the Valdezia Dam in the Dominican Republic had its power intakes blocked for half a year due to 17 meters of sediment and debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Reduced Lifespan of Infrastructure** Reservoirs were historically designed with a presumed working life, often around 100 years, after which they were expected to be lost due to siltation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. However, many dams are critical infrastructure that cannot simply be abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Managing Reservoir Siltation

Strategies for managing reservoir siltation fall into three main categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>:

### 1. Sediment Yield Reduction

This approach focuses on reducing the amount of sediment that flows into reservoirs in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The most significant cause of high sediment yields is upstream soil erosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

#### Preventing Soil Erosion
Soil erosion is frequently caused by human activities, such as deforesting and cultivating sloping lands for agriculture, which makes these areas highly vulnerable to rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Methods to protect soils from being washed away include:
*   Reducing the amount of soil tilled, turned over, and disturbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   Protecting denuded soil with mulch cover or vegetation, such as vetiver grass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   Utilizing terracing, an ancient method where slopes are converted into a series of flat steps with dikes to prevent water from washing away soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

A major challenge in implementing these methods is the massive size of many watershed areas, often spanning hundreds of miles and involving different governances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Despite these challenges, such efforts can be successful. Siltation rates in Australia significantly declined after the 1950s due to the introduction of new farming techniques and land conservation methods, leading to lower sediment yields in rivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

#### Trapping Sediment Upstream
Another strategy to reduce sediment yield before it reaches the main reservoir is to create buffer reservoirs upstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   For example, along the Paraná River in South America, 39 major dams (including the Itaipu Dam, the world's second-largest hydropower project) inadvertently serve as sediment traps for the larger Yacyretá hydropower dam downstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   On a smaller scale, increased construction of tiny farm ponds along river tributaries in Central Texas led to a 55% decline in sediment yield in the watershed, resulting in a siltation rate for local reservoirs that was twice as good as similar reservoirs in other states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### 2. Sediment Routing

Sediment routing involves tactics that prevent sediment from accumulating at the reservoir's bottom by directing it around or through the reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

#### Pass-through or Sluicing Gates
This prominent routing tactic, following the Chinese slogan "discharge the muddy water, impound the clean water," involves opening dam gates to flush out muddy water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This requires a substantial reservoir drawdown, potentially lasting weeks or months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Dams must be designed with outlets capable of handling this flushing process; many of the older, silted dams in Australia, for instance, failed because their outlets were too small to allow large amounts of silt-heavy floodwaters to pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Many large dams in China, such as the Yellow River's Sanmenxia Dam (primarily for flood control), utilize this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

#### Sediment Bypass Tunnels
Another form of routing is to bypass the dam entirely using tunnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. These tunnels are more suitable for medium-sized dams where normal pass-throughs might be less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The advantage is that they do not require flushing the reservoir's water levels and allow the river's natural flow to continue, offering ecological benefits, though these tunnels are typically open for only two to five days a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Switzerland implemented some of the first bypass tunnels in the 1970s, followed by Japan in the late 1990s and 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:01]</a>.

### 3. Sediment Removal

Despite preventive measures, silt and sediment will eventually accumulate in dams, necessitating removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

#### Dry Excavation
This invasive and costly effort involves dewatering the reservoir (which can take up to a year) and then using conventional equipment to excavate the sediment slurry and transport it elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Costs vary significantly depending on the dam's specific circumstances; in 1993, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works dry excavated several dams at costs ranging from $5 to $30 per square meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

#### Dredging
Dredging is a commonly practiced method, similar to how river bottoms are cleared for commercial shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Hydraulic dredging** mixes sediment with water and sucks it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Mechanical dredging** uses a machine-powered clam shell or bucket to dig up sediment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Dredging is an expensive endeavor, reserved for large projects, and may not be fast enough to combat high sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. In Taiwan, despite a cumulative $160 million spent on dredging, high sediment yields have only allowed for the restoration of 8% of the total reservoir capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

#### Underwater Explosions
Engineers have also proposed using underwater explosions to loosen sediment deposits, making them easier to flush or dredge out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. In 2018, Taiwanese civil engineers experimented with this method at the critically important Zengwen Reservoir, which provides 40% of the area's water and cannot use sediment pass-through methods due to the need to conserve water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

The Zengwen Reservoir already uses a de-silting tunnel and mechanical dredging to remove up to 2 million cubic meters of sediment annually, reaching 8-10 meters deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. To address more impacted sediment, dynamite was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Measures like underwater speakers, black pepper powder, and an air bubble curtain were employed to protect animal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Two experiments were conducted:
1.  **Free drop method:** Dynamite packed with sand and gravel was blown up at the bottom, creating a 20-meter-wide sediment crater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
2.  **Drilled hole method:** A 15-meter-deep hole was drilled and then exploded, loosening a 10-meter layer of sediment that remained loose for six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

Calculations showed that blasting, combined with dredging and desilting tunnels, could free up an additional 15% of reservoir capacity, leading to a recommendation to continue the blast work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Engineers have dealt with reservoir siltation since ancient times; the Romans, for instance, equipped the 1,700-year-old Monte Novo Dam with two outlets for flushing sedimented water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. However, societies sometimes lose the ability to maintain these structures, leading to abandoned and silted reservoirs, such as the 1,800-year-old Roman-built Harbaka Dam in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Like any other piece of human-built [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources | infrastructure]], dams require continuous effort to maintain their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

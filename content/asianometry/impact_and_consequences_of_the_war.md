On the morning of February 17, 1979, the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China commenced shelling the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, followed by 100,000 PLA troops crossing the border and sweeping through Vietnamese border areas, taking several cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This military invasion was the culmination of numerous escalating offenses and quibbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Reasons for the Conflict

Despite shared Marxist ideologies and historical comradeship, with China playing a crucial role in aiding Vietnam against the French and Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, tensions had been growing between the two Communist Parties since the reunification of Vietnam at the end of the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The relationship between Vietnam and China had been complex and conflicted for centuries, including a nearly 1,000-year period of colonization and a 20-year invasion by the Ming Dynasty in the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

From the Vietnamese perspective, Chinese intentions were never pure, viewing Vietnam as a junior partner rather than an equal, and bristling at any attempts by Vietnam to assert its independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Although China provided almost $20 billion in aid during the war against the United States, this assistance came with the condition that Vietnam could not accept aid from the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Conversely, the Chinese felt angered by what they perceived as Hanoi's lack of gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Further contributing to the rancorous relationship were escalating border clashes and explosions involving ethnic Chinese in Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Deng Xiaoping's China believed Vietnam had become "too big for their britches" and deserved a "lesson" for its "insolence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

The Chinese Communist Party also desired to improve relations with the West and distance itself further from the Soviets, who were considered their biggest foreign policy threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The Sino-Soviet Split had long been ongoing, stemming from disputes between Mao and Khrushchev over the denouncement of Stalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Despite Soviet attempts to thaw relations, China mistrusted them due to continued Soviet military buildup and exercises along their shared border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Deng Xiaoping's Objectives

After emerging as China's paramount leader in July 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, Deng Xiaoping, who seized power from Hua Guofeng <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, steered China towards a moderate agenda focused on economic modernization and opening up to the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This meant warming relations with the United States, seen as the global leader in technology and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Invading and subduing Vietnam was potentially viewed as a serious indicator of China's intentions to the global community, demonstrating a clear distinction from the Vietnamese Communist Party and proving China's military capability to fight alongside the West against Soviet influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

Deng Xiaoping almost singlehandedly drove the war effort, seemingly harboring an irrational grudge against the Vietnamese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. As paramount leader, his decisions were unquestioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Deng specifically instructed the army to limit the war's scope to achieve China's political goals, aiming to avoid getting bogged down like America did in Vietnam and to keep the Soviet Union from intervening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Course of the War

The war was planned in two stages:
1.  A two-pronged offensive striking Cao Bang, Lao Cai, and Dong Dang (February 17-25) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
2.  PLA forces converging on Lang Son (February 26-March 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

After these stages, the Chinese army would withdraw and claim victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The PLA allocated about 330,000 men for the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

The Vietnamese high command was baffled by the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Chinese propaganda had been active, calling the Vietnamese "dogs of the Soviet Union" and the "Cuba of the East" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. A massive evacuation of 300,000 civilians from Heilongjiang and Xinjiang (Soviet border zones) guarded against a Soviet counterattack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Vietnamese regular troops were mostly away suppressing military action in Cambodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. The remaining forces were 150,000 regional security and militia troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Chinese Central Command's assessment ignored these militias, assuming an overwhelming 8-to-1 advantage, a mistake that cost many lives as the Vietnamese local forces proved well-trained and well-equipped, making the real advantage closer to 2-to-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

On February 17, 1979, at 5 AM, artillery fire began along the Sino-Vietnamese border, followed by 100,000 soldiers and tank units advancing towards Lang Son, Cao Bang, and Lao Cai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Lao Cai was a focal point due to its railroad to Hanoi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Air support was absent as Deng and Central Command restricted Chinese flying missions to Chinese airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The rigid top-down command structure prevented middle and lower-ranking officers from making independent judgments, forcing the PLA to send human waves against fortifications, leading to thousands of deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

Through sheer force of numbers, the PLA advanced 10 miles into Vietnamese territory, taking border towns and pushing towards Lao Cai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. They took two small towns en route to Dong Dang, where they met the Vietnamese "Flying Tiger Regiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

On February 20, Beijing publicized their actions, reporting "very heavy" losses on the Vietnamese side (10,000 wounded or killed) compared to 2,000-3,000 Chinese casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. However, the PLA also suffered significantly. Chinese soldiers discovered, as the Americans did, the difficulty of jungle fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The PLA was not well-trained for these conditions, suffering immense casualties from tunnel/jungle warfare, booby traps, land mines, and bamboo stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Vietnamese militias expertly used fortified border provinces with tunnels, caves, and trenches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Rain bogged down operations, forcing troops to use horses and donkeys for transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Tank units suffered heavy losses, with 87% experiencing damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

Despite the difficulties, Lao Cai and Cao Bang were captured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. On February 21-22, forces converged on Lang Son, 85 miles from Hanoi, where the heaviest fighting occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Following Mao's strategy, the PLA first occupied the surrounding countryside, mostly surrounding Lang Son by March 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Casualties were high on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. On March 3, the PLA attacked the Khua Ma Son mountains to complete the capture of Lang Son, successfully taking a fortified hill in 10 minutes and blowing up adjacent Vietnamese artillery positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

## Conclusion and Aftermath

Deng and the Chinese high command emphasized from the start that the incursion would be short, publicly announcing it as a limited war with limited aims: to keep Vietnam in line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This was to prevent larger powers, specifically the Soviet Union, from intervening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This strategy succeeded, as the Soviets ultimately stayed out as long as the fighting remained "limited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

On March 5, Beijing announced they had "advanced 30 ... to 80 miles, taken the capitals of Lang Son, Cao Bang, and Lao Cai and 17 other countries and cities, and damaged severely 4 regular divisions and 10 regiments of the enemy forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. With their political goals achieved, the PLA began to withdraw, and the Vietnamese allowed the retreat to proceed orderly, choosing not to escalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### Casualties and Performance Assessment

Varying sources cite different casualty figures for the PLA. Beijing initially claimed 20,000 killed or wounded during the three-week battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Hanoi claimed to have inflicted about 42,000 Chinese casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Other estimates suggest 25,000 PLA killed and 37,000 wounded, while another source states just 6,900 dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. Regardless, a significant number of Chinese soldiers died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. In comparison, the United States suffered 356,962 killed or wounded over 20 years in Vietnam, a number the PLA could have reached in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

Party officials' documents acknowledged that the PLA underperformed operationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Army planners had arrogantly claimed they could take Hanoi in a week with a fraction of their forces, but it took 16 days and 10 full divisions to cover only a third of that distance, and they didn't even face the proper Vietnamese army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. The PLA's weapons were backward, tactics needed updating from Mao's era, and morale was troublingly low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. The top-down command structure led soldiers to feel their lives were being wasted, with some units reportedly "forced" to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

Today, the PLA is a much different fighting force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. However, the war illustrates how the Chinese Communist Party views war: as a tool to aid its political goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. If the Party achieves its goals, the PLA is deemed successful, regardless of its performance or the number of casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This approach is reminiscent of the Red Army's tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. The Party believed it successfully delivered a message to Vietnam, thus deeming the PLA's mission a success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

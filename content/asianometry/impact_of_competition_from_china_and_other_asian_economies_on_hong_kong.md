The de-manufacturing of Hong Kong's economy is considered a significant mistake, as it led to the city's loss of its ability to produce goods that are in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This shift occurred despite comments suggesting that manufacturing simply moved to Shenzhen, allowing Hong Kong to focus on services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Rise of Hong Kong's Manufacturing Industry

Following the Chinese Civil War, Shanghai industrialists and numerous refugees relocated to Hong Kong to escape the Communist Party of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. These industrialists brought capital and manufacturing expertise, re-establishing factories to leverage the labor opportunities provided by approximately 1 million poor Chinese migrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Due to limited land, factories produced lightly manufactured items like plastic flowers, clothes, and radio assemblies from high-rise buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Hong Kong's manufacturing sector grew opportune as the United States and other Western nations began sourcing manufactured goods from Asia in the 1950s, a trend that intensified over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. By the early 1960s, Hong Kong became the largest manufacturer in the developing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. These low-skilled jobs enabled many to earn a living and build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Emergence of Competition and Lack of Technological Advancement

However, competition quickly arose from places like South Korea and Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Costs in Hong Kong increased as workers' salaries improved, and new generations demanded a better lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Hong Kong's manufacturing industries had little to offer beyond cheap labor, lacking the technological expertise to produce native technologies for critical components, which had to be imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. For instance, electronics OEMs spent 60% of their budget on integrated circuits imported from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

This made Hong Kong's industry uncompetitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. By 1981, manufacturers sought government assistance to upgrade technological capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. In contrast, governments in Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea invested millions in acquiring and naturalizing their own technologies for commercial use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## British Colonial Policy and Economic Priorities

Hong Kong's [[economic_history_and_policies_during_british_colonial_rule_in_hong_kong | economic history]] under British colonial administration was unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. It was arguably never intended to be more than a small trading post between China and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The government and trading houses settled on a fiscal compromise: no import or export taxes, with revenue primarily generated from land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The government holds superior title to all land, leasing it for money, which incentivized an economy based on rising land prices and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

By 1949, Hong Kong's largest companies were banks, land development companies, and trading houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Many industrialists, like Li Ka-shing, closed factories to become landlords, finding it more profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. These influential companies saw no reason for government intervention to support manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Consequently, the Hong Kong government adopted a non-interventionist stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## The Shift to a Service Economy

As a result, manufacturing largely moved to China, leading to a significant loss of lower and middle-income jobs in Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. The city instead doubled down on finance and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Hong Kong's economy stopped making and exporting goods, focusing instead on serving as a value-added intermediary for investments and cargo between international companies and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Hong Kong's British heritage, English language, and pro-business attitudes facilitated this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

The [[the_shift_from_manufacturing_to_service_industries_in_hong_kong | service industry's contribution to Hong Kong's GDP]] dramatically increased:
*   **1980**: 68% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
*   **2000**: 86.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
*   **2019**: 93.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>

Construction is the second largest sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Hong Kong is now primarily a service economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Chief Executives like Tung Chee-hwa and Donald Tsang did not attempt to reverse the [[Deindustrialization and its impact on Hong Kongs economy | de-manufacturing trend]], instead promoting Hong Kong's benefit from the free flow of capital and trade between China and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Impact of China's Economic Opening

The more China reformed and opened up, the less Hong Kong's service economy model produced for its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The Pearl River region has become a top logistics and transport center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, and Shanghai has taken on many of Hong Kong's service economy functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Many mainland Chinese cities reformed financial restrictions, allowing foreign capital into their ports and logistic networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Hong Kong's share of China's trade with the world declined significantly:
*   **1997**: 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
*   **2007**: 28% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
*   **2020**: 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>

With transport, trade, and logistics declining, the financial services sector became Hong Kong's primary growth engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Its contribution to the economy grew from 18% in 2000 to nearly 30% in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. However, even this sector faces increasing competition as China lifts foreign ownership restrictions on its investing and banking markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. By 2020, foreign banks could fully own Chinese subsidiaries, and the same applied to securities and fund management firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This allows foreign companies to offer financial products directly to Chinese consumers, with major asset managers like BlackRock entering the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Challenges for Young Hong Kongers

The increasing financialization and competition raise questions about future economic pathways and [[challenges_facing_young_people_and_the_labor_market_in_hong_kong | wealth security for young Hong Kongers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Housing prices have become exorbitant, far outpacing wage growth, making home ownership unattainable for most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Key factors contributing to the housing issue:
*   **Currency Peg**: The Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar since 1983 removes control over interest rate policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Land Monopolies**: Much undeveloped land is held by large land development monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Failed Reforms**: Attempts at housing price reform in the 1990s failed and were rolled back after the [[impact_of_the_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | 1997 Asian financial crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Stagnant Public Spending**: Public spending on housing as a percentage of GDP has not increased since 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Government's Policy Vision and its Flaws

The Hong Kong government's unclear new policy vision appears to promote a society where individuals work in high-tech industries, then invest their earnings in wealth-building assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. However, this approach has issues:
*   **Job Creation**: The financial sector alone cannot provide enough high-paying, high-value jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Finance, insurance, and real estate (excluding construction) account for less than 10% of the city's jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Dominant Service Sector**: Nearly 85% of Hong Kong's adult population works in large service-oriented companies (supermarkets, utilities, business services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This sector is stagnant and dominated by land developer conglomerates, making it difficult for new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Wage Inequality**: This contributes to massive and growing wage inequality, with many service workers over-educated for their jobs and few career upgrading prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

Since 2016, attitudes have shifted, with the government recognizing the need for new career pathways for youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. They identified emerging industries to develop a knowledge-based economy, including:
*   Cultural and creative industries (games, software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>
*   Medical services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>
*   Education services (potentially benefiting from mainland crackdowns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>
*   Testing and certification (ISO services for Pearl River companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>
*   Innovation and technology, seen as a powerful growth engine for young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>

## Consequences of Financialization and Public Goods

New policies encouraging stock ownership among Hong Kongers have increased market participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has become a destination for Chinese companies like Didi and Alibaba fleeing unfriendly [[Impact of American sanctions on Chinese technology | American capital markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. However, stock market participation is more for staying rich than getting rich, primarily benefiting those already earning substantially more than the average household income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Hong Kong stocks have shown lagging growth, with the Hang Seng Index returning 3.56% total over five years, compared to the S&P 500's 16.6% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. The paradox is that for Hong Kong's listed companies to become more shareholder-friendly, they might implement actions like mass layoffs or moving workers into non-standard employment, increasing economic burdens on residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

With real estate too expensive, the government and financial sector have packaged public goods and assets into investment vehicles, benefiting some at the long-term detriment of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

### Case Studies: MTR and The Link

*   **MTR Privatization**: In 2000, the Hong Kong MTR (railway company and land developer) was partially privatized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. After privatization, it stopped receiving free land grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. The MTR then focused on profitable land management and landlord services, expanding into advertising and telecom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. While financially self-sufficient, this shift means the mass transit company prioritizes monetizing existing networks over extending them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **The Link REIT**: The government sold car parking and retail facilities for public housing complexes to a real estate investment trust called The Link, ostensibly to raise funds for the housing authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. The IPO, subscribed by retail investors, valued The Link at up to five times its IPO price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Subsequently, The Link raised rents, causing economic hardship for many shop owners and tenants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

While Hong Kong's economic choices have generated wealth for many and its GDP is at an all-time high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, it came at the cost of opportunities for its majority poor, who now see limited avenues for advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. The city missed the opportunity to develop a sophisticated manufacturing sector, such as a "Hong Kong TSMC," despite close ties with the West that could have facilitated technology transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. This lack of economic diversification means Hong Kong now relies on turning its public goods and people into investable assets and cash flow streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

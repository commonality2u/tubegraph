For decades, Eastman Kodak and Fujifilm dominated the [[rise_and_fall_of_silverbased_photographic_film_industry | silver-based photographic film industry]], clashing for market dominance in both individual and global markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Founding and Early Years

Fujifilm was established in 1934 as a subsidiary of Dai Nippon Celluloid Company, Japan's inaugural cinematic film manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This venture came after Dai Nippon's approach to global leader Kodak to build a photographic film factory in Japan was declined by founder George Eastman, who deemed the climate too humid for high-quality film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

In response, Dai Nippon, with financial backing from the Japanese government, initiated Fuji Photo Film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. The company strategically located its first factory at the foot of Mount Fuji in Minami Ashigada City, Kanagawa, to secure access to high-quality water and air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. A key differentiator for Fujifilm was its decision to produce photographic film internally rather than importing it, hiring a German emulsion specialist for technical expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This early emphasis on developing proprietary technology became a cornerstone of their culture and strategy, with Fujifilm known for investing significantly more in research and development than its competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

Before World War II, Fujifilm began researching color photography film, a complex process requiring precise mixing of cyan, magenta, and yellow to avoid color imbalances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Such film consists of approximately 20 overlapping, evenly coated layers of functional particles, about 20 micrometers thick, demanding near-semiconductor quality control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. The war temporarily halted this work as the Japanese military commandeered its facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Fujifilm completed its color film product in 1948, followed by popular releases like amateur roll film (1952) and black-and-white roll film (1958), distinguishing the company from its nearly 30 domestic competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Head-to-Head Competition

Around the time Japan reopened its markets to foreign competitors, including Kodak, the rivalry intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. In 1963, Fujifilm generated approximately $75 million in revenue, while Kodak boasted $1.1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. Kodak leveraged a globally recognized brand and vast resources, even owning a silver mine and cattle ranch for film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

Despite enjoying preferential treatment in its domestic market, including an import quota until 1968 and a subsequent tariff, Japanese consumers initially favored Kodak as a superior brand, viewing Fujifilm as lower quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. However, Fujifilm systematically narrowed the technical proficiency gap, with its films outperforming Kodak's in certain technical areas by 1970, such as requiring less light for image retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

### Strategic Differences

Fujifilm capitalized on its technical prowess to maintain its niche in the Japanese high-end prosumer and professional photography sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. A crucial aspect of their strategy was the introduction of a mini-lab retail model, enabling third parties to offer speedy one-hour film development, thereby establishing a robust and lasting network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. By 1994, Japan had 13,400 such mini-labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

Kodak inadvertently aided Fujifilm by mishandling its Japanese market entry. Outsourcing its marketing to a third-party distribution firm, which primarily focused on price cutting, led Kodak to occupy the low-end market segment in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

In 1972, Fujifilm began selling under its own brand in the United States. While failing to penetrate the drugstore market loyal to Kodak, it found success in American supermarkets and established a presence in the niche movie and professional photography sectors by emphasizing technical quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. Fujifilm further bolstered its brand by sponsoring major sporting leagues like the NBA and the Olympics, notably being the official sponsor of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. In 1982, the company received an Academy Award for technical merit for its a250 Motion Picture film, the world's fastest color motion picture negative film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. These efforts solidified Fujifilm's reputation as a "superior quality" film provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

By 1995, Fujifilm's rising success, holding 13% of the U.S. market share, led to political friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. This included a 1993 lawsuit from Kodak alleging dumping, which Kodak lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. Fujifilm responded by setting up a color film paper lab in South Carolina to ease concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. In July 1995, Kodak filed another petition, accusing Fujifilm of colluding with the Japanese government to exclude Kodak products from the Japanese market, where Fujifilm held 70% market share compared to Kodak's less than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. Fujifilm vigorously defended itself, leading to the World Trade Organization rejecting the lawsuit in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

> "The back and forth between the two companies was legendary. They competed in price, sponsorships, and even in court like two nights locked in single combat." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>

## The Digital Transition

Both Kodak and Fujifilm long acknowledged that digital imaging was the future, developing many digital imaging technologies themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

In 1975, Kodak employee Steve Sasson assembled the first digital camera, combining CCT chips from Fairchild, an analog-to-digital converter from Motorola, and a Kodak lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. This early prototype, weighing 8 pounds and the size of a toaster, produced poor imagery, but Kodak employees foresaw silver-based imaging products becoming obsolete by the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. Kodak scientists developed high-quality image sensors, including a 1.4 million-pixel CCD sensor in 1986, but it failed to gain market traction due to high cost and lack of compatible peripherals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. Kodak's digital explorations often resulted in patents but rarely successful new businesses, largely because the company struggled to reconcile new digital ventures with its highly successful traditional film business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

Kodak's hesitation in pursuing ventures that didn't perfectly fit its core model was evident when, in 1976, it failed to aggressively pursue the market for its microprocessor-equipped Ektaprint printer, which was simpler and more reliable than its Xerox rival, due to unfamiliarity with heavy equipment rental business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

Conversely, [[diversification_and_innovative_strategies_of_fujifilm | Fujifilm's diversified business]] provided early warnings about the impending digital shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. In 1981, Fujifilm released a diagnostic X-ray imaging product, replacing X-ray film with a photosensitive plate, leading to the 1983 release of Fuji Computed Radiography, which is still in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. The digitization of plate making for publications also highlighted the eventual redundancy of film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

Komori, then a sales manager, worried about a future without film, realizing that years of specialized photographic technology development would become irrelevant with image digitization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. Recognizing this existential threat, Fujifilm's new president, Minoru Onishi, appointed in 1980, introduced a three-pronged strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>:
1.  **Pioneer Digital Imaging Technologies:** Similar to Kodak, Fujifilm sought to develop its own imaging sensors, leading to the 1988 Fujifilm DS-1P, its first digital camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.
2.  **Milk the Analog "Cash Cow":** Fujifilm aimed to prolong the life of its analog film business by enhancing film image quality to widen the gap with digital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.
3.  **Build New Business Lines:** The company needed to develop businesses entirely outside digital photography or analog photographic film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

In the mid-1980s, Fujifilm began investing in various [[diversification_and_innovative_strategies_of_fujifilm | diversifications]], including peripheral businesses like inkjet and optical disk technologies, and new ventures based on core photographic film manufacturing technologies, such as cancer pharmaceuticals in collaboration with a Nobel Prize-winning scientist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

Despite these efforts, Fujifilm's existing core business was thriving, having surpassed Kodak in technology and releasing popular products like the profitable Fujifilm QuickSnap disposable camera in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. In 1986, Fujifilm generated over $600 million in operating profits, and the core industry's success often hindered diversification efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

### The Digital Tipping Point

The launch of Casio's QV-10 digital camera in 1995, the first commercially successful consumer digital camera, marked a turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. While expensive ($833), with subpar image quality and poor battery life, its 1.8-inch color LCD screen allowed instant photo viewing without development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

Although early CCD-based digital cameras struggled with image quality, shutter speeds, battery life, and high costs, photographic film sales peaked in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. However, global demand for color film began a rapid decline of 20-30% annually a year later due to the widespread proliferation of CMOS image sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. Unlike specialized, expensive, and power-hungry CCDs, CMOS sensors, while initially producing worse images, could be mass-produced cheaply by semiconductor fabs using existing silicon processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>. By the mid-1990s, process nodes advanced enough for higher-quality active pixel CMOS sensors, and their inclusion in mobile phones starting in 1999 provided the final catalyst for the [[rise_and_fall_of_silverbased_photographic_film_industry | silver-based film camera's end]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>.

## Divergent Fates

In 2004, with its core business collapsing, Fujifilm's CEO Shigataka Komori announced "Vision 75," a plan to guide the company beyond its roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. This plan involved:
1.  **Strategic Reforms:** Fujifilm underwent significant restructuring, spending $1.8 billion from 2006 to cut 15,000 jobs, close factories, and cancel distribution partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. Unlike its domestic competitor Konica, which exited the photography business entirely, Komori remained committed to preserving the culture of photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>.
2.  **New Growth Businesses:** Recognizing that digital cameras would not replace the profits once generated by film, Fujifilm transitioned into entirely new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. Many of these emerged from the technologies behind their film business, such as Fujitec, a highly transparent triacetate celluloid originally used in film bases, which found application as a protective covering for LCD screens and became a billion-dollar business by the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>.
    Inspired by Fujitec, Fujifilm identified six priority businesses: Digital Imaging (high-end digital cameras), Optical Devices (lenses for broadcast, security), Specialty Chemicals/Materials (serving solar, touch panel, semiconductor industries), Graphics (digital printing, inkjet), Documents (printers, copiers, primarily via Fuji Xerox joint venture, becoming its largest business line in 2021), and Healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>. Fujifilm's [[diversification_and_innovative_strategies_of_fujifilm | diversification into healthcare]] was a significant expression of its commitment to survival, leveraging its expertise in emulsions, oxidation, and collagen from film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>. This was supported by a surge in R&D and strategic acquisitions, including Toyama Chemical for $1.5 billion in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:18:00">[19:18:00]</a>.

In its 2008 fiscal year, Fujifilm achieved its highest historical sales of 2.8 trillion yen (approximately $27 billion USD), with imaging products' share of revenue shrinking from 54% to just 19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:00">[19:36:00]</a>. Although revenues declined post-2008 due to the global financial crisis, Fujifilm maintained around $20 billion in annual revenue since 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:11:00">[20:11:00]</a>.

This outcome contrasts sharply with Kodak's fate. From 2005 to 2010, Kodak's sales plummeted from $11 billion to $5.9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a>. While Kodak also attempted to shrink its film manufacturing business, cutting $1.2 billion in costs and 20,000 jobs by 1999, it remained fixated on selling film and providing photography services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a>. Previous CEO Colby Chandler's [[challenges_and_failures_in_kodaks_diversification_attempts | diversification attempts]] into floppy disks, batteries, artificial snow, and pharmaceuticals were reversed by his successors, who doubled down on imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:00]</a>. Notably, Kodak spun off its specialty chemical business (Eastman Chemical), which was formed in 1920 and accounted for only 8% of its sales, and sold its Sterling Winthrop drug unit, which included Bayer Aspirin and generated over $1 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>. Despite researching and patenting pharmaceutical and medical equipment similar to Fujifilm, Kodak withdrew from these ventures in 1996, rededicating itself as an "imaging company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>.

Kodak focused on developing new digital technologies to meet customer imaging needs, releasing the successful EasyShare digital camera in 2001 and holding leading market share in the U.S. digital camera space between 2004-2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>. However, like Fujifilm, it learned that digital cameras were an unprofitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>. Its market share declined to 7% by 2010, with more revenue coming from licensing digital technology patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>. A foray into the inkjet printer business in 2005, likely at the behest of new CEO Antonio Perez (formerly of HP), led to significant net losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>. In 2007, Kodak sold its last valuable asset, its healthcare division, and burdened with debt and pension liabilities, filed for bankruptcy five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:05:00">[23:05:00]</a>.

## Key Differences in Strategies

The fundamental [[key_differences_in_strategies_between_fujifilm_and_kodak_during_digital_transition | difference between the two]] lay in their foundational identities: Kodak was primarily a consumer brand with a strong technology base, while Fujifilm began as a technology company that happened to sell to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>. When their consumer businesses disappeared, Fujifilm, rooted in chemical expertise and precision chemical manufacturing, could return to its core competencies and diversify into new areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:38:00">[23:38:00]</a>. Kodak, lacking expertise in semiconductors or electronics, remained stuck on its sinking ship, unable or unwilling to pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:00">[23:51:00]</a>. The name "Fujifilm" itself serves as a reminder of its origins in technological expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04:00">[24:04:00]</a>.

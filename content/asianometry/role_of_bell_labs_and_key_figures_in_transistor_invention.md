The "zero hour" for the microelectronics technology timeline is set at December 16, 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, marking the invention of the first [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This discovery fundamentally changed technology, moving beyond the [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors|vacuum tube]] to establish the foundation for modern computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Beginnings: The Need for a Vacuum Tube Replacement

AT&T and Bell Labs had a long-standing desire to replace the [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors|vacuum tube]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. While [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors|vacuum tubes]], like the triode, were crucial for radio, TV, and telecommunications due to their ability to rectify and amplify signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, they posed significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. AT&T's massive telephone infrastructure relied on them, but they were a strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For example, a single transcontinental phone call in the late 1940s and early 1950s required 12,300 [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors|vacuum tubes]], primarily for signal amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. These tubes were large, expensive, prone to burning out, and their failures negatively impacted customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. By the 1930s, AT&T sought a more reliable alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

William Shockley joined Bell Labs' Vacuum Tube Department in 1936, pursuing this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Early research focused on the copper-oxide rectifier, which converts AC power to DC for stable telephone power supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. A Bell Labs scientist recognized the rectifiers' similarity to [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors|vacuum tubes]] in signal amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. William Brattain was hired to work with Joseph Becker to try and modify rectifiers to act as [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors|vacuum tube]] amplifiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. These initial experiments, however, did not succeed due to a lack of proper physics grounding and the use of impure semiconducting materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Wartime Influence

World War II played a crucial role in advancing semiconductor research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Shockley himself served in anti-submarine research and oversaw radar system deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. While the U.S. initially lagged behind the British in solid-state physics for semiconductor technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, the immense resources poured into wartime semiconductor research made a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Dozens of laboratories focused on radar research, with important work involving very pure germanium and silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Purdue University, under Professor Karl Lark-Horovitz, received a U.S. government grant in 1942 to produce "point contact crystal rectifiers," also known as "cat's whisker" detectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. These detectors, pressing a thin metal wire against a semiconducting material, had advantages for radars, especially in microwave wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. A key challenge was the "cat's whisker" burning out due to impurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This led to efforts to produce extremely pure germanium and silicon crystals, enabling purity levels of 99.999% after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Bell Labs also shifted focus to wartime radar priorities, which stimulated progress in semiconductor research and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Post-War Reorganization and Shockley's Vision

With the war's end, Mervin Kelly became Bell Labs' director of research in spring 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Recognizing Bell Labs' leading position in solid-state physics, Kelly created interdisciplinary research groups, pulling together electrical engineers, chemists, experimentalists, and theorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. William Shockley, fresh from his wartime contributions, co-headed one of these groups, which included Walter Brattain and John Bardeen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

After visiting Purdue in September 1945, Shockley and his team became convinced that silicon and germanium were the best candidates for their goals, favoring germanium for its lower melting temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. In January 1946, Shockley made a key prediction: applying a strong external electrical field to a thin layer of silicon or germanium could modulate its conductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This "field effect" suggested the possibility of creating a three-terminal device, similar to the [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors|vacuum tube]] triode, that could amplify signals or act as a switch for binary data (1s and 0s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## The First Transistor: Point Contact Transistor

Shockley's initial "field effect" experiments, carried out by his cohorts, failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Bardeen, a brilliant theorist, and Brattain, a skilled experimentalist, collaborated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. When observed modulation was less than predicted, Bardeen theorized that the electrical field was blocked at the surface of the semiconducting material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This led them to probe the germanium surface with two wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

After numerous experiments, Bardeen suggested placing the two probes very closely together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Brattain achieved this by cutting a gold foil on a polystyrene triangle, then carefully cutting the gold in two at the apex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This setup was then carefully pushed onto the germanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. On December 16, 1947, they ran the experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>:

> "I found that, if I wiggled it just right so that I had contact with both ends of the gold, that I could make one contact an emitter and the other a collector, and that I had an amplifier with the order of magnitude of 100 amplification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

This deceptively simple setup created the solid-state amplifier, strengthening a small signal many times over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Brattain recognized its significance immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Bardeen, more reserved, told his wife, "We discovered something important today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

### Secrecy and Public Announcement

AT&T kept the discovery secret for a few months, patenting the design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. They demonstrated it to U.S. military brass, who even considered classifying it or building it via an "underground" venture similar to the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Fortunately, the general applications of the device were deemed too broad for classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. News was released on June 30, 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, with *The New York Times* dryly stating the [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]] had "applications in radio where a [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors|vacuum tube]] ordinarily is employed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### Limitations of the Point Contact Transistor

The "point contact [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]]" was historically important but largely accidental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Its discovery team was looking for something else entirely, and most people, even a decade later, did not fully understand its underlying physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. As a commercial product, it failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Bell Labs' sister company, Western Electric, produced 8,400 devices a month by 1952, hoping to replace [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors|vacuum tubes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. However, its operation depended on fragile semiconductor surface structures, making it susceptible to humidity and temperature, leading to inconsistent performance and limited commercial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

## The Junction Transistor: Shockley's Triumph

William Shockley was not directly involved in the point contact [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]] experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. After eight years on the topic, he felt frustration and a competitive drive to achieve his own breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. He also recognized the point contact [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]]'s weak commercial prospects and the need for a fleshed-out theory, intensifying his theoretical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

While Bardeen and Brattain demonstrated their device, Shockley furiously made notebook entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. On January 23, 1948, he unified existing concepts with observations from the initial discovery to create the **junction transistor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. This device is made of three sections of "p-type" and "n-type" semiconducting materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. P-type material has an abundance of "electron holes" (majority carriers), while n-type has an abundance of electrons (majority carriers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. These can be arranged as N-P-N or P-N-P, with emitter, base (middle), and collector regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

The critical realization for Shockley was that at the "junctions" where p-type and n-type materials meet, majority charge carriers can travel across the two junctions from emitter to collector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This process, known as "minority carrier injection," was key to a far more resilient and commercially useful device, as the current flowed through the bulk of the material rather than just along the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Manipulating the current into the base could control a much larger current, allowing for amplification or switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

Shockley initially kept his idea secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. However, in February 1948, Bell Labs physicist John Shive's experimental point contact [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]] results showed electron holes moving through the entirety of the germanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Shockley saw this as proof of his minority carrier injection concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

Later, in 1950, Bell Labs chemists Gordon Teal and Morgan Sparks adopted the Czochralski process to grow long, narrow crystals of very pure germanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This method allowed them to alternatively dope the germanium crystal with P and N-type impurities, creating P-N junctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. From this, Bell Labs released the first "grown junction transistors" in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The junction [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]], a sturdy three-part "sandwich," was immediately seen as superior to the fragile point contact [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

### Shockley's Standing and Bell Labs Dynamics

Shockley, working largely by himself, crafted an entirely new page of semiconductor physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Bardeen had missed the concepts behind minority carrier injection, dismissing them as impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Shockley solidified his position as the leading figure in [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]] theory with his book "Electrons and Holes in Semiconductor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Bell Labs began promoting him alongside Bardeen and Brattain as inventors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

However, Shockley's difficult nature led him to block Bardeen and Brattain from further work on the junction [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. This resulted in Brattain transferring out of the solid-state physics group and Bardeen leaving Bell Labs entirely to work on superconducting theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. Bardeen later won his first Physics Nobel, and a second for BCS superconductor theory in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. Despite the internal friction, Shockley always clarified that Bardeen and Brattain, not he, discovered the first [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.

## Transistor Explosion and Computing Applications

In 1949, an antitrust suit against AT&T led to a Consent Decree requiring them to license their discoveries, including the [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This allowed domestic and foreign companies to purchase patent licenses for $25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. Bell Labs held its first symposium on [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]] manufacturing in September 1951, circulating an 800-page book and samples to licensees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

Former [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors|vacuum tube]] companies like RCA and General Electric aggressively built up germanium [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]] capacity, innovating further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. In 1951-1952, General Electric and RCA discovered the "alloy junction [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]]", a more scalable manufacturing process than the grown junction method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

By 1953, the first [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology|transistorized]] products, like hearing aids, entered the market, revolutionizing the experience for the hard-of-hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. The news spread globally, leading to competing designs like France's "transistron" and Japan's own point contact and junction transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. Sony Corporation in Japan notably commercialized the [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology|transistor]] radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

From the outset, the potential for [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistors]] in computers was recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. Replacing thousands of [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors|vacuum tubes]] with transistors would result in smaller, more energy-efficient, cooler, and more reliable devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. While early production challenges delayed this dream due to high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>, progress was swift. In November 1953, the University of Manchester fired up a computer with 92 first-generation point contact transistors, widely considered the first [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology|transistorized]] computer (though it still had tubes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

Bell Labs and other companies, spurred by military demand, poured resources into making more reliable transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. The commercialization of improved alloy junction transistors, like Philco's "surface-barrier [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]]", paved the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. In May 1954, the U.S. Air Force received TRADIC (TRAnsistor DIgital Computer), built by Bell Labs, featuring 700 transistors to test digital navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. In less than ten years, the [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]] evolved from a fragile lab experiment to a component flying thousands of feet in the air, establishing [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology|transistorized]] computers as second-generation devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

## Conclusion

Near the end of 1954, William Shockley resigned from Bell Labs to start his own business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. He convinced Arnold Beckman to set up his Semiconductor Lab within Beckman Instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. By this time, Bell Labs' dominance in [[history_of_the_transistor_development|transistor]] patents began to decline as former [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors|vacuum tube]] companies aggressively entered the business, marking the end of Bell Labs' exclusive pioneering status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

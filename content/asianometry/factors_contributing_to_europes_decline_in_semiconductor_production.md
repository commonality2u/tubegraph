From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Europe, once an early pioneer in semiconductor technology, has seen its influence wane over decades, becoming a minor producer and consumer of chips today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While firms like ASML, STMicroelectronics, and Infineon exist, they represent a small percentage of global semiconductor design, fabrication, and assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This decline is attributed to a combination of political, technological, and production issues that have compounded over more than half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:01">[03:00:01]</a>.

## Early Promise and Missed Opportunities (1950s)

Europe independently invented the first transistor just months after the Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. In 1948, Herbert Matera (Telefunken) and Heinrich Welker (Munich University), German scientists who had studied semiconductor materials for radar receivers during World War II, moved to France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Working at a Westinghouse subsidiary in Paris, they developed a "point contact transistor" conceptually similar to Bell Labs' invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This device, named "transistron" by Eugene Thomas, France's Secretary of Post, Telephones and Telegraphs, was lauded in the French press as superior to its American counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Patents were granted in the US and France in 1951 and 1952 respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, and a factory was built in France capable of producing tens of thousands of transistrons monthly by late 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

However, this early lead was quickly lost:
*   **Government Focus Shift**: Shortly after the transistron's announcement, the French government redirected its resources to developing nuclear technology, leaving the telecommunications industry to private enterprise without government funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Work on the transistron languished, and its inventors eventually moved on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Struggles**: France's early semiconductor efforts, though impressive, struggled with the unpredictable nature of early semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This led teams to conservatively turn towards more abstract and theoretical research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Comparison to US Success**: The [[impact_of_the_american_and_japanese_semiconductor_industries_on_europe | American semiconductor industry]] managed this unpredictability through:
    *   **Knowledge Dispersion**: Bell Labs openly shared transistor production knowledge through symposia and liberal licensing, fostering innovation across many companies, including Texas Instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
    *   **Interdisciplinary Teams**: American teams, like the "Traitorous Eight" co-founders of Fairchild Semiconductor, were deliberately interdisciplinary, with members trained in physics, mechanical engineering, or optics, rather than solely electrical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   **Hands-on Approach**: Scientists like Jean Hoerni were pushed to handle technological processes directly, leading to innovations such as the planar process, which enabled reliable, high-scale transistor production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Lack of Collaboration**: A lack of joint business-government initiatives in France hindered the commercialization of theoretical breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Pierre Aigrain, a key figure in French semiconductor research, focused on theoretical space, and French businesses underinvested in R&D, often using outdated vacuum tube technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Economic Instability**: Economic and political crises in France (1957-1958), partly due to the Algerian War, led to austerity policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The French transistor industry, 90% dependent on government, suffered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This forced consumer electronics companies to turn to imports, and a falling franc currency further eroded profits and impeded investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. By the end of the 1950s, the French semiconductor industry had fallen behind Japan and other European peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## The Integrated Circuit Era and Divergent Demands (1960s)

The 1960s saw the rise of the integrated circuit (IC), jointly invented by Texas Instruments and Fairchild Semiconductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This era highlighted a key difference between the US and Europe:
*   **Demand Drivers**:
    *   **United States**: The military played a critical role, buying half of the semiconductor industry's output by the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Projects like the Minuteman 2 ICBM and the Apollo program drove demand for smaller, lower-power, and highly reliable devices, pushing American firms to develop high-performance techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
    *   **Europe**: Demand came primarily from the consumer sector, which emphasized price over performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. In 1963, military demand was just 29% in France and 8% in West Germany and Italy, while consumer demand was 56% in West Germany, 35% in France, and 50% in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Technological Conservatism**: European electronics giants like Philips and Siemens viewed semiconductors as components for their final products, focusing on evolutionary improvements to in-house transistor technologies, particularly germanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. They believed silicon was only suitable for high-temperature applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Disruptive Innovation vs. Vertically Integrated Giants**: The US saw startups and spin-offs (Shockley Semiconductor, Fairchild, Intel, AMD) producing semiconductors as an end product, leading to disruptive technologies like the silicon planar transistor, which obsoleted older alloy junction technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Fairchild's aggressive cost-cutting, selling ICs below manufacturing cost to stimulate demand, further accelerated market growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Japan's Catch-up**: [[impact_of_the_american_and_japanese_semiconductor_industries_on_europe | Japan]], starting from a similar position to France or Germany, rapidly adopted transistor technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. The Japanese government encouraged radio and television adoption, gated imports to protect domestic industry, and Japanese companies aggressively signed technology licensing agreements, quickly mastering and innovating upon acquired knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   **Limited Technology Transfer to Europe**: While foreign companies like IBM and Texas Instruments built factories in Europe in the 1960s, successful technology transfer often did not occur, possibly due to limited labor mobility or a lack of specific requests for such transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **French Policy Misdirection**: The French government's 1961 plan to support its calculator and computer industries inadvertently turned its computer industry against its nascent semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Computer makers stated they could not find competitive French semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. France's 1966 "Plan Calcul" prioritized a national computer quickly, pushing the domestic semiconductor industry to the back burner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The core issue remained a lack of sufficient production scale for French chip makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## The Age of Microprocessors and VLSI (1970s-1980s)

The 1970s brought increasing complexity with the introduction of the microprocessor (Intel 4004 in 1971) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. This era of Large-Scale Integration (LSI) and later Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) demanded significant resources and pushed for more technically aggressive products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

*   **Europe's "Demand Gap"**: Europe not only lacked the production capability for high-performance LSI devices but also a strong source of demand for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
    *   **Weak Computer Industry**: European computer companies were much smaller than American ones, contributing to a "computer gap" against IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
    *   **Weak Military/Avionics Demand**: European military and avionics demand was weak, especially in West Germany, and favored large, established firms, hindering disruptive technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.
    *   **Fragmented Telecom Market**: The telecom market was fragmented, with large telcos pursuing their own designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
    *   **Consumer Electronics Preferences**: European consumer electronics companies like Philips and Siemens continued to seek cheaper, rather than leading-edge, chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **Contrast with [[impact_of_the_american_and_japanese_semiconductor_industries_on_europe | Japan]]'s VLSI Project**: By 1974, Japanese IC output was only a quarter of the American industry's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. Alarmed, the Japanese government launched the Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) project in 1976, budgeting hundreds of millions to unite computer makers and cooperatively develop next-generation VLSI technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. This project helped Japanese semiconductor makers master techniques for high-transistor-count chips, combined with ample capital and a technological shift to CMOS, revitalizing their industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.
*   **West German Approach**: West German industrial policy was more market-oriented and decentralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.
    *   **Reliance on Giants**: Government funding (e.g., $1.4 billion from 1974-1979 for semiconductors) was funneled through large firms like Siemens and AEG, who lagged the Americans by a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Siemens was particularly conservative, leading to the nickname "a bank with an attached electronics department" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.
    *   **AEG's Decline**: AEG, West Germany's second-largest electronics giant, lost competitiveness in consumer electronics in the early 1970s, leading to significant losses and eventual sale to French company Thompson-Brandt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.
    *   **Market Share Loss**: Siemens and AEG both lost market share in Europe's largest semiconductor market throughout the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.
*   **1980s Challenges**:
    *   **IT Trade Deficit**: Europe faced a growing IT trade deficit, reaching almost $7 billion by 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>.
    *   **Reliance on Foreign Alliances**: European tech companies often formed technology alliances with American or Japanese firms (e.g., Ericsson with National Semiconductor and Texas Instruments; Philips with AMD, RCA, Texas Instruments; Siemens with Intel, Toshiba, Fujitsu) rather than other European companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. Only 25% of European IT companies struck alliances with other European companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.
    *   **Insufficient Funding**: French microelectronics plans in the 1980s, despite significant budgets, paled in comparison to the economic might of American and Japanese investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. In 1984, French semiconductor investments were just 1.4% of the world total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.
    *   **Mega Project**: West Germany's "Mega project" (1984) involved Siemens and Philips developing advanced DRAM and SRAM chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>. While Siemens debuted its 4-megabit chip in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>, it relied on licensed technology from Toshiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>, and still lagged Japan, which had already debuted a 16-megabit DRAM chip by that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Jesse Project**: The Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative (Jesse), a pan-European consortium for advanced chip research, suffered from Philips pulling out of memory production, ICL being acquired by Fujitsu, and Siemens forming an alliance with IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>. Its budget also increasingly shrank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.
*   **Declining Market Share**: European producers' share of world semiconductor production fell from 60% in 1979 to 12% in 1985, and further to 10% in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. By 1991, European companies had less than 30% of their own market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.

## The 1990s and Beyond: Intensified Competition

The 1990s brought skyrocketing technological and financial barriers to semiconductor entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>, with a 250-nanometer memory fab costing $1-2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.

*   **Rise of Asian Foundries**: Competition intensified with the emergence of Asian foundries like TSMC, Chartered Semiconductor, and Samsung, located near the growing Asian electronic supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. TSMC's pioneering independent foundry model enabled semiconductor outsourcing and accumulated scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. South Korean firms benefited from "chaebol" banking systems that absorbed initial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.
*   **Unfavorable Demand Structures**:
    *   European firms lost the consumer electronics space to Asian competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.
    *   Military and government spending declined after the fall of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.
    *   Computing remained dominated by American firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.
    *   While Europe remained strong in industrial, telecommunications, and automotive fields, these did not capture the majority of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

Europe's semiconductor decline is a result of compounded historical factors, from early policy missteps and manufacturing struggles to differing market demands and insufficient investment compared to global competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>. Despite consistent financial support and R&D coordination by European governments and the EU, including initiatives like the EU Chips Act, Europe's market share has remained around 10% since 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>.

Sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries are garnering renewed interest, particularly with [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries|Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL)]] recently unveiling their first-generation for [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries|commercial use]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While scientists initially developed both sodium-ion and lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries simultaneously, lithium-ion rose to dominance, leaving sodium-ion by the wayside until recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Structural Similarities and Differences

Both sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries share a similar fundamental structure, comprising a cathode, an anode, a porous separator between the two, and an electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The primary distinction between the two battery types lies in the different compounds used for their components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This similarity in structure means that [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries|commercial sodium-ion batteries]] can potentially leverage the same engineering and production methods as lithium-ion batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Advantages of Sodium-ion Batteries

The single biggest advantage of sodium-ion batteries over lithium-ion batteries is the availability of raw materials and the associated cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Raw Material Abundance**: Almost all of the world's lithium comes from only four countries: Australia, Chile, China, and Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Extracting lithium is neither easy nor environmentally friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Furthermore, other critical elements like cobalt, often used in lithium-ion batteries, raise significant environmental and humanitarian concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. In contrast, the global supply of sodium is essentially unlimited, with over 1,000 times more sodium than lithium in the Earth's crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Cost of Raw Materials**: This abundance translates to a raw ingredient cost of $150 per ton for sodium, compared to lithium's $5,000 per tonâ€”a 30-times decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Property**: In the 2000s, concerns emerged regarding the supply of raw materials for lithium-ion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Additionally, a less recognized reason for renewed interest in sodium-ion batteries is the issue of [[the_influence_of_patents_on_lfp_battery_development|intellectual property rights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. So many patents have been filed around lithium-ion technologies that new companies must be extremely cautious to avoid legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Sodium-ion battery technologies, by contrast, offer far larger "green fields" in terms of intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Disadvantages of Sodium-ion Batteries

*   **Energy Density and Operating Voltage**: Sodium has a lower ionization potential (or energy) than lithium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This means that sodium-ion batteries will inherently have lower energy densities and operating voltages than their lithium counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. It is currently unclear whether sodium-ion batteries can ever catch up to top-line lithium-ion batteries in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Commercial Cost Savings**: While raw material costs are significantly lower, the overall manufacturing processes for sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries have substantial overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Therefore, the end-user cost for sodium-ion batteries will not be drastically lower than lithium-ion batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Estimates suggest end-users might see 10% to 30% price savings using sodium-ion batteries, all else being equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Historical Context and Development

The [[development_history_of_sodiumion_batteries|development of sodium-ion batteries]] began in the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. In 1968, Ford developed the sodium-sulfur battery for [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage|electric vehicles]], but it only worked at very high temperatures (300 to 350 degrees Celsius), leading to safety and longevity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Despite further advancements in molten salt batteries (e.g., the Zebra battery in 1985), Sony's successful [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries|commercialization]] of the lithium-ion battery in 1989 quickly led to its dominance in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

However, in the 2010s, due to concerns about lithium supply and [[the_influence_of_patents_on_lfp_battery_development|intellectual property]], interest in sodium-ion batteries, particularly those operating at room temperatures, re-emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The number of publications related to sodium-ion batteries has since rapidly increased, even surpassing those for lithium-ion batteries in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Materials and Chemistry

Current research in [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion battery development]] primarily focuses on:
*   **Anodes**: Most studies converge on using "hard carbon" (colloquially, charcoal) for anodes, which can feature a unique porous structure to lengthen cycle lifetime and improve sodium ion movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Electrolytes**: Researchers generally choose sodium salts dissolved in organic carbonate solvents, ensuring low viscosity, high conductivity, and electrochemical stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Cathodes**: This area sees the most research focus, as it's the most expensive component and key to viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   **Sodium Layered Oxides**: The most common and studied class, these have a crystalline structure of metal oxides with sodium ions sandwiched between, similar to lithium cobalt oxide used in lithium-ion batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
    *   **Prussian White**: [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries|CATL]] has notably opted for Prussian white as their cathode material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This material is cheap, easily made, non-toxic, and shows good discharge rates and capacity retention over many cycles, despite losing capacity in the presence of moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
    *   Other candidates include sulfides, phosphates, and vanadium-based polyanionic compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Performance and Commercialization

[[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries|CATL's first-generation sodium-ion battery]] can achieve energy densities of up to 160 Wh/kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This is comparable to current [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology|lithium-ion phosphate (LFP) batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. CATL aims for over 200 Wh/kg in their second generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Leading companies like CATL can leverage their existing lithium-ion infrastructure and product ecosystem due to similarities in engineering and manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. CATL has also developed battery system integration capabilities that allow them to mix and match sodium and lithium-ion batteries into a single system, where the higher energy density lithium-ion batteries are used when sodium-ion falls short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Potential Applications

While sodium-ion batteries may never replace lithium-ion in high-energy density applications like mobile phones, they show significant potential in areas where space is less of a concern and cost savings are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. These include:
*   Short-range [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage|electric vehicles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>
*   Stationary power systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>
*   Energy storage for large-scale solar and wind renewables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>

The presence of a major player like CATL in this space, leveraging its size, manufacturing skill, and R&D savvy, indicates a serious effort to make sodium-ion batteries a viable and widely adopted technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

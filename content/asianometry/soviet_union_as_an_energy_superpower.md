In 1979, the Soviet Union was the world's leading producer of oil, pumping 11.5 million barrels each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. At the end of the 1960s, the [[soviet_oil_production_in_the_1960s | Soviet Union]] was the second-biggest oil-producing nation globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. However, the country's most abundant oil and natural gas reserves, hidden beneath Siberia's frozen swamps and lakes, were yet to be fully discovered and exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The development of these resources transformed the Soviet Union into an energy superpower, a factor that ultimately contributed to its dissolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## West Siberian Basin: A Frozen Frontier
The Soviet West Siberian Basin, located about 600 miles east of the Ural Mountains, is a vast, flat area covering 3.4 million square kilometers, nearly five times the size of Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Approximately one-third of this area, almost one million square kilometers, is potentially oil-bearing, which is larger than Texas and Oklahoma combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The region is undeveloped, harsh, and remote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Summers are short, and winters are long and severe, with temperatures dropping to as low as -27 degrees Celsius, making frost and fog common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Sixty to seventy percent of the area consists of swamps and lakes, which freeze solid for 9 or 10 months of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Consequently, the area is sparsely populated, with most peasants who came to Siberia during the Trans-Siberian Railroad construction settling in the warmer south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Despite these challenges, beneath these lands lie some of the world's largest oil and gas deposits, second only to those in the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. These include the massive Urengoy gas field and Russia's biggest oil field, Samotlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## The Push for West Siberian Oil
From 1960 to 1970, the [[soviet_oil_production_in_the_1960s | Soviet Union's total oil production]] surged from under 3 million barrels per day to 7.1 million barrels, roughly 380 million metric tons per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Much of this oil came from the "Second Baku" area of the Volga-Ural province in European Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Soviet geologists had predicted the West Siberian Basin's significant deposits as early as the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. However, the Soviet government initially hesitated to develop these fields, questioning the extent of the reserves and the feasibility of extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. One high-ranking Communist Party member dismissed the claims as "fruit of a sick provincial imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Circumstances forced a change of mind. By the mid-to-late 1960s, the Volga-Ural oil fields began declining much faster than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. From 1971 to 1975, the decline was 261 million tons, far exceeding the planned 150 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

The oil production business had critical functions for the Soviets:
*   It was the country's largest source of foreign currency, over 50%, essential for purchasing goods like wheat from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This highlights the significant [[economic_impact_of_oil_production_on_the_soviet_economy | economic impact of oil production on the Soviet economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   The Soviets had long-term oil export obligations to Eastern Bloc countries, all of which (except Romania) depended on Soviet energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. These deliveries were made through extensive pipelines named "Druzhba" (Friendship) or "Bratsville" (Brotherhood) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

In January 1968, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin visited the Tyumen region, emphasizing its potential for advancing the [[economic_impact_of_oil_production_on_the_soviet_economy | Soviet economy]] and the need for infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. By 1971, Brezhnev urgently pushed for West Siberian development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. A new ministry was established to build oil infrastructure, led by Boris Shcherbina, later known for managing the Chernobyl crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Overcoming Development Challenges
Developing West Siberia posed immense challenges. Unlike older oil regions, West Siberia was virtually unpopulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. The Soviets had to create entire towns from scratch, bringing in hundreds of thousands of geologists, builders, and work crews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Worker settlements were difficult to build due to harsh conditions, and with agriculture nearly impossible, all food had to be transported by rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The cost of living was 1.5 to 1.7 times greater than in European parts of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Unlike Stalin's era, workers now had freedom of choice, so incentives were necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Salaries were 2.2 to 2.5 times higher, and promotions were easier to secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The party ran media campaigns to attract specialists, mostly young workers under 35, seeking to earn significant money quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Production Boom and Environmental Cost
West Siberia soon began yielding its vast riches:
*   **1965:** 5.6 million tons of oil and 1.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **1970:** Oil production reached 31 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **1975:** Oil production surged to 141 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **1977:** An astounding 211 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

By 1973, 113 oil fields had been discovered, including supergiant fields like Samotlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The Soviets built long gas pipelines to transport products to buyers in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. In the second half of the 1970s, 1,400 kilometers of pipeline were laid, moving 130 million cubic meters of soil and tearing up 27.2 million square meters of agricultural land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Pipeline construction rates were three to five times faster than in the West, with costs a third of Western averages, partly because ready-made pieces were trucked from factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

However, this economic success came at a severe environmental cost. The Soviets disregarded ecology to fulfill economic plans, leading to wastewater pollution, torn-up swathes of taiga, and hundreds of abandoned drilled wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. West Siberia was constantly pushed to generate more oil despite warnings about sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## [[influence_of_soviet_oil_exports_on_international_relations | Influence of Soviet Oil Exports on International Relations]]
West Siberia's oil dominance found customers at the right time. International conflicts in the 1950s and 60s demonstrated to Europe that sole reliance on Arab oil was precarious, making Soviet oil an appealing diversification option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Austria was the first Western European country to sign an oil deal with the Soviets in 1968, followed by Italy (1969), West Germany (1970), and France (1972) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. West Germany was a particularly notable achievement for the Soviets, despite domestic controversy over taking Soviet gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. While coal mines were exhausted and domestic gas demand was skyrocketing, political issues like Berlin's division and German reunification were concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. However, the German Ministry of Economics deemed it acceptable if the Soviet share remained below 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The year after West Germany began accepting Soviet gas, the Four Power Agreement of 1971 was signed, with the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic de facto recognizing each other's sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

These agreements led to further economic partnerships throughout the 1970s as part of d√©tente <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. In 1972, the U.S. and Soviet Union agreed on a potential "North Star" energy deal, envisioning liquefied natural gas shipments to the American West Coast from 1980 to 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This deal, which would have brought significant LNG revenues and Western technologies, was eventually denied by Congress due to opposition to granting most-favored-nation status and credit guarantees, and was called off in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. The oil crises of the 1970s, including the Iranian Revolution, further accelerated economic exchanges between the Soviets and Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Eastern Bloc Dependence
Soviet oil and energy exports were a crucial factor holding the Eastern Bloc together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. After World War II, the [[postwar_soviet_union_oil_industry_developments | Soviet Union]] established the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA or Comecon) for Eastern Bloc states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Within the CMEA, the Soviets supplied raw goods, and satellite states sent back manufactured goods, machinery, and agricultural produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Oil deliveries were made on "brotherly terms" at prices far lower than the Western market rate, with the Soviet Union absorbing extraction cost increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

These inter-bloc trade agreements were known to be unfavorable to the Soviets since the mid-1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. As the Soviets developed their lucrative West European energy export industry in the 1970s, the opportunity costs of these "friendship" oil trade agreements became increasingly apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Nevertheless, states like East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary had become heavily dependent on these "brotherly" oil imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Failure to meet these obligations would have had severe political and socioeconomic repercussions, especially as satellite states became more indebted to Western creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

## Stagnation and the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Decline of the Soviet Economy]]
The expectation that the West Siberian energy giant would grow indefinitely proved false; production stalled and declined as fast as it grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Starting in 1975, West Siberia's oil production growth rates rapidly declined, from 23.8% in 1976 to 7% in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This abrupt stagnation had massive ripple effects throughout the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

During the 1960s, [[soviet_oil_production_in_the_1960s | Soviet oil production]] increased by about 9.1% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Between 1971 and 1978, this rate fell to 6.2%, signaling that the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet oil juggernaut]] was sputtering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. By 1981, the country's total oil growth rate dropped to under one percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Without access to more advanced oil drills and pumps from the West, Brezhnev and the Soviets resorted to simply drilling more exploratory wells further out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Annual drilling doubled from 13 million meters in 1977 to over 26 million in 1984, with 16 million of that new drilling in West Siberia alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This meant exploratory teams had to travel further, drill deeper, and work in more complicated formations, doubling drilling costs per meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Despite these efforts, things continued to deteriorate, and in 1984, Soviet oil output fell into negative growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

### An Unproductive Industry
The Soviet energy industry, and eventually the [[economic_impact_of_oil_production_on_the_soviet_economy | Soviet economy]] as a whole, found itself investing more to produce less, caught in a cycle of "throwing good money after bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. The Soviet empire's demand for oil increased; in 1970, it needed the energy equivalent of 0.71 tons of coal to generate a thousand dollars of economic income, which rose to 0.83 by 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. The [[economic_impact_of_oil_production_on_the_soviet_economy | Soviet economy]] had become more energy-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

Cutting consumption was difficult. In the West, a significant share of oil consumption came from flexible car drivers and households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. In the Soviet Union, only 15% of oil consumption came from households, with nearly half from heavy industry, which was far less flexible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. While a push to switch from oil to natural gas yielded some savings, the country's considerable oil export obligations meant the Soviets had little room to cut consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Thus, the oil wells had to produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

By the late 1980s, the Soviet Union remained the world's largest producer of oil and third-biggest producer of coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Despite this, the country's [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | economy stagnated]], consumed by its unproductive energy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Coherence within the Eastern Bloc faded as the Soviets prioritized their own needs over those of their socialist allies, leading satellite states to turn to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

### Collapse of Oil Prices and Dissolution
In 1986, oil prices collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Rising output from Alaska, the British North Sea, and OPEC (particularly Saudi Arabia's drastic quota increase in September 1985) contributed to an oil glut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Oil prices plummeted from $27 a barrel to below $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

This meant all the Soviet investment in oil suddenly turned a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Foreign currency earnings from oil and gas sales evaporated, paving the way for the debt crisis that dissolved the Soviet Union a few years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. High energy revenues had "papered over" the need for much-needed [[challenges_faced_by_the_sovet_economy_in_its_later_years | reforms]] in the [[economic_impact_of_oil_production_on_the_soviet_economy | Soviet economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. There was "no need to improve domestic agriculture if oil money paid for meat and butter from the West; no need to make your own computer if you can just buy them from the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

Energy both sustained and undermined the Soviet Union. It was a pillar that kept the Soviet house standing for longer than it should have, but also a crutch that weakened the country's ability to stand on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. The legacy of the Soviet energy superpower and its [[influence_of_soviet_oil_exports_on_international_relations | influence on European and Asian politics]] continues to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

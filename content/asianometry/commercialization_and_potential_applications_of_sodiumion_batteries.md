Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) recently launched their first generation of sodium-ion batteries for commercial use, marking a renewed interest in this battery technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Scientists initially developed sodium-ion batteries alongside lithium-ion batteries, but lithium eventually became dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This article reviews sodium-ion batteries, their development status, and their implications for the broader renewable energy market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Basic Structure and Comparison with Lithium-Ion

[[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | Sodium-ion batteries]] share a similar structure with lithium-ion batteries, featuring a cathode, an anode, a porous separator, and an electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Ions migrate between the cathode and anode when the battery is in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The primary distinction lies in the different compounds used for their components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. A key advantage is that commercial sodium-ion batteries can potentially share the same engineering and production methods as lithium-ion batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The most significant advantage of sodium-ion batteries is the availability and cost of raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Most of the world's lithium originates from just four countries: Australia, Chile, China, and Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Lithium extraction is neither easy nor environmentally friendly, and other critical elements like cobalt raise significant environmental and humanitarian concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. In contrast, the global supply of sodium is virtually unlimited, with over 1,000 times more sodium than lithium in the Earth's crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This translates to a raw ingredient cost of $150 per ton for sodium, compared to lithium's $5,000 â€“ a 30-fold decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## [[development_history_of_sodiumion_batteries | Development History of Sodium-Ion Batteries]]

The [[development_history_of_sodiumion_batteries | development history of sodium-ion batteries]] began in the early 20th century with the discovery that molten salts could conduct high amounts of sodium ions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

*   **Ford's Sodium-Sulfur Battery (1968)**: Scientists at Ford developed a sodium-sulfur battery for electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. It consisted of metallic sodium and liquid sulfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Ford believed a 350-pound battery could provide 200-300 miles of range for a 1,350-pound car at 40 mph, with a minimum charge time of half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. The major challenge was its high operating temperature (570-660 degrees Fahrenheit or 300-350 degrees Celsius), which caused safety and longevity issues, especially in cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. For instance, aluminum-based container tubes would react and rupture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Ford never commercialized this technology for EVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   **Molten Salt Battery Applications**: While not ideal for mobile electronics, molten salt batteries have real-world applications, including guidance systems in missiles and extreme environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Ford sold this technology to Japanese company NGK, which sells them as stationary battery solutions for peak energy use and grid stabilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Zebra Battery (1985)**: The 1970s oil crises rekindled interest in the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. In 1985, South African researchers developed a new molten salt battery using nickel chloride and sodium tetrachloroaluminate, known as the Zebra battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Lithium-Ion Dominance**: In 1989, Sony successfully commercialized the lithium-ion battery, which rapidly gained industry favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This led to a significant shift in research focus towards lithium-ion technologies, which now dominate the industry for electric vehicles, stationary batteries, and mobile gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Renewed Interest in Sodium-Ion

In the 2000s, concerns arose regarding the supply of raw materials for lithium-ion batteries, as natural lithium sources are limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Another less-discussed factor contributing to renewed interest in sodium-ion batteries is intellectual property rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Numerous patents have been filed around lithium-ion technologies, making it challenging for new companies to innovate without legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. In contrast, sodium-ion battery technologies offer a much larger "green field" for innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Starting in the 2010s, researchers began re-examining sodium-ion batteries, with a focus on developing room-temperature versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The number of publications related to sodium-ion batteries rapidly increased, eventually surpassing those for lithium-ion batteries in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development | Materials and Technologies in Sodium-Ion Battery Development]]

While prototypes vary, scientists have largely converged on a few high-potential [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development | sodium-ion battery chemistries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

*   **Anodes**: Most studies focus on making anodes from "hard carbon," colloquially described as charcoal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Electrolytes**: The electrolyte facilitates sodium ion travel between the anode and cathode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Ideal electrolytes have low viscosity, high conductivity, and electrochemical stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Researchers typically use sodium salts dissolved in organic carbonate solvents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Cathodes**: Much of the recent research is concentrated on the cathode, which is the most expensive component and crucial for overall viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   **Sodium Layered Oxides**: The most common and studied cathode materials are sodium layered oxides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. These have a crystalline structure of metal oxide sheets with sodium ions sandwiched between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Their crystalline structures share similarities with lithium cobalt oxide, the first legitimate cathode material in lithium-ion batteries, making them promising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   **Other Candidates**: Other research candidates include sulfides, phosphates, fluorophosphates, carbon phosphates, and vanadium-based polyanionic compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Commercialization Efforts and Startups

The science has progressed rapidly, and the first sodium-ion battery products are moving towards commercialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

*   **CNRS CEA / Tiamat Energy (2015)**: The first commercially ready sodium-ion battery was an 18650 cell created by the French research agency CNRS CEA in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This standard format battery (18mm wide, 65mm tall, cylindrical) had an energy density of about 90 Wh/kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. In 2017, the research was spun off into Tiamat Energy, aiming to develop low-voltage systems for hybrid vehicles and ensure French technological sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Washington State University (2020)**: In June 2020, researchers at Washington State University and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory announced a more advanced sodium-ion battery, with a speculated practical specific energy of about 160 Wh/kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This is comparable to current [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | lithium-ion phosphate (LFP) batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
    *   **Limitations**: Despite advancements, sodium has a lower ionization potential than lithium, meaning sodium-ion batteries will inherently have lower energy densities and operating voltages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. It is uncertain if they can ever match top-tier lithium-ion batteries in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Other Startups**: Several other technology startups are working to commercialize sodium-ion batteries, including UK-based Faradion Limited, Sweden-based Altris AB, China-based Hina Battery, and US-based Natron Energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## [[CATLs_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries | CATL's First Generation Sodium-Ion Batteries]]

[[CATLs_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries | CATL's first generation sodium-ion battery]] features an anode made of hard carbon, which includes a unique porous structure that extends its cycle lifetime and improves sodium ion movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. For the cathode, CATL has opted for Prussian White <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

*   **Prussian White Cathode**: Prussian White is an analog of Prussian Blue pigment, first synthesized over 300 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. It is cheap, easily made, and non-toxic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Researchers in the early 2010s discovered its suitability for sodium-ion battery cathodes due to good discharge rates and capacity retention over many cycles (some tests show 95% retention after 10,000 cycles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. A drawback is that Prussian Blue cathodes lose significant capacity in the presence of moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Performance**: CATL's first-generation sodium-ion battery can achieve energy densities of up to 160 Wh/kg, comparable to the Washington State battery and current [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | lithium-ion phosphate (LFP) batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Their second generation aims for over 200 Wh/kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Integration**: CATL can leverage the similar engineering and manufacturing processes between sodium and lithium-ion batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This allows them to integrate their sodium-ion offering tightly into their existing lithium-ion infrastructure and product ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

## [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | Cost and Integration]]

Due to the significant overlap in preparatory processes, sodium-ion battery costs will not be drastically lower than lithium-ion batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Most savings will come from cheaper raw material costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. One paper estimates end-users could see 10-30% price savings with sodium-ion batteries, all else being equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

CATL also highlighted battery system integration capabilities, allowing them to mix and match sodium and lithium-ion batteries into a single system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. In such a system, higher energy density lithium-ion batteries are automatically used when sodium-ion batteries fall short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

## [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage | Potential Applications]]

While many new battery chemistries fail to achieve widespread commercialization, factors like inertia play a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. For example, lead-acid batteries, despite lower energy densities and toxic materials, remain widely used due to their low cost and reliability, with nearly $50 billion in global sales in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

Sodium-ion batteries are unlikely to replace lithium-ion in all use cases, such as mobile phones and other electronic gadgets, where high energy density in a small space is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. However, they show strong potential in:
*   **Short-range electric vehicles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>
*   **Stationary power systems**: This includes [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage | energy storage]] for solar and wind renewables, where space is less of a concern and the cost savings are highly valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

CATL's involvement is significant, as they are the world's largest battery company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Their commitment of resources, manufacturing expertise, and R&D capabilities could enable sodium-ion batteries to reach their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

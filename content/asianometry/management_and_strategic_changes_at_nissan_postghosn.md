The abrupt departure of [[Carlos Ghosns impact on Nissan | Carlos Ghosn]] in late 2018 plunged Nissan into disarray, as he had been a critical connector within the company, and his absence threw things into a loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. This marked the beginning of a period of significant management and strategic changes for the automaker.

## Immediate Aftermath and Leadership Turmoil
Carlos Ghosn's arrest in November 2018 on charges of underreporting income and other allegations led to his immediate removal from his positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Ghosn maintained his innocence and later fled Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

The chaos continued when his immediate successor as Nissan CEO, Hiroto Saikawa, also had to resign. It was revealed that Saikawa had violated internal rules regarding his own stock pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

## Navigating Challenges and Strategic Reset (2019-2021)
From 2019 to 2021, Nissan struggled to regain its footing after the excesses of the Ghosn era, compounded by a global pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. During this period, the company implemented several strategic changes:
*   **Job Cuts and Factory Closures**: Thousands of jobs were eliminated, and several factories abroad were closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Sales Strategy Adjustment**: Nissan reduced deep discounts and fleet sales, which had previously diluted brand value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
*   **Dealer Relations Reset**: The company worked to reset its relationships with its dealer network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
*   **Financial Impact**: These changes led to a sizable loss of revenue, although revenue has since recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

## Redefining the Alliance with Renault
A major objective for Nissan post-Ghosn was to reset its unequal shareholding relationship with Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. This process was prolonged and fraught with "toxicity, leaks to the press, massive internal infighting, and tangled ties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

The final deal was sealed in 2023, following Nissan's decision to force out its COO and two directors who strongly objected to the agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. The terms of the deal included:
*   Renault's stake in Nissan was trimmed to 15% through share sales and transfer to a trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.
*   Nissan gained equivalent voting rights for the 15% stake it held in Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
*   In exchange, Nissan agreed to invest in Renault's new EV division, Ampere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

The future of Mitsubishi Motors, the "awkward third child" added to the alliance in 2016 after an emissions scandal, remained cloudy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

Nissan's CEO, Makoto Uchida, acknowledged the turbulent past of the alliance, stating that "the past is the past," and emphasizing the need to focus on the future, especially given the "massive challenge in terms of rolling out electric vehicles in the US" and the "wake-up call" from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

## Impact of the Chinese EV Market
The rapid and aggressive rise of Chinese EV companies presented a significant challenge for Nissan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. These companies, fueled by a powerful EV ecosystem and a large domestic market, produced incredible products at hyper speed, treating cars like consumer electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

Nissan's internal combustion engine joint ventures in China, like Dongfeng Nissan, struggled to keep pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. In 2023, Nissan's sales in China, its top market accounting for a third of its global sales, fell by approximately 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. Similar declines were projected for 2024, with factory utilization in China reportedly at 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. This market challenge was exacerbated by senior management being preoccupied with the share deal with Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

## Proposed Merger with Honda
In late December 2024, Nissan announced a plan to [[nissans_proposed_merger_with_honda | merge with Honda]], described by some as more of a takeover or a "shotgun marriage" arranged by the Japanese government to save Nissan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

The talks for this [[nissans_proposed_merger_with_honda | merger with Honda]] were reportedly initiated when Foxconn, the Taiwanese giant, began exploring the possibility of buying into Nissan through Renault or its trust banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Foxconn, seeking to enter the EV industry and enable a client to access global markets, saw Nissan as an "ultimate play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. The abrupt tie-up with Honda was seen as a way to prevent this, as Nissan is considered "one of Japan Inc's crown jewels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

However, Honda was not "super stoked" about dealing with Nissan's existing problems, which include an aging vehicle lineup and a lopsided cost situation where Japan accounts for less than 20% of car production but nearly half of the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. Honda's CEO famously described Nissan as a business partner as "That's a difficult one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. Honda set a condition that Nissan must triple its profit by 2026 for the [[nissans_proposed_merger_with_honda | merger]] to proceed, which raises the question of why Nissan would need to merge if it could achieve such a feat independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

The overall situation was characterized as a "raging dumpster fire," with the end of Nissan as an independent entity appearing to approach, regardless of whether the merger ultimately happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

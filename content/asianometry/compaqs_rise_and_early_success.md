The early years of the [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] Computer Company are legendary for their absolutely insane growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Founded in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] achieved $111 million in revenue in its first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Following its IPO in December 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, revenue surged to $329 million in 1984, representing 200% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. By its third year, revenue hit $504 million with 53% growth, earning it a spot on the Fortune 500 list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] later reached $1.2 billion in revenue for 1987, achieving this faster than any company in history at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

During this period, [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] led an insurgency of IBM PC clone-makers against Big Blue, overwhelming IBM and unlocking the PC standard for a new generation of PC manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Engine: Product

In its early years, [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] leveraged several growth engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>:

*   **Breakthrough Product**: [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] offered a product that was both compatible with and sufficiently differentiated from the original IBM PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] Portable, while not a true laptop, could be transported, a capability the original IBM PC lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. IBM didn't introduce its own portable until February 1984, over a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The Portable's cheaper price made it a suitable second computer for working professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Compatibility**: [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] went to great lengths to produce a computer fully compatible with IBM's extensive ecosystem of business software, including its flagship productivity spreadsheet software, Lotus 1-2-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This compatibility required the use of a cleanroom, with two teams re-implementing the IBM PC BIOS code, and fidelity to the IBM PC's hardware, even down to the keyboard layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Engine: Speed

[[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] significantly outpaced IBM in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>:

*   **Faster Development Cycle**: IBM's product development cycle was slow, taking about 12 to 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. In contrast, [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] adopted a messy, chaotic approach that brought products to market in just 6 to 9 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Market Leadership**: This speed allowed [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] to bring new technologies to market faster than IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. A classic example is the iconic Deskpro 386, the first IBM PC clone equipped with leading-edge silicon, which hit the market a full year before IBM had a similar product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Availability**: [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] was also quicker than anyone else, including IBM, to fill shelves with product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. IBM's early struggles to meet demand meant frequent stock-outs, making [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] a compelling alternative due to its availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Engine: Distribution

A third major engine of [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]]'s success was its relationship with dealers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>:

*   **Dealer-Only Channel**: While IBM began selling through retailers like Sears, BusinessLand, and ComputerLand, this often led to conflicts as IBM also used its own sales force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]], however, made retailers its *only* distribution channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Dealer Loyalty**: Co-founder and CEO Rod Canion emphasized, "Keep the seller sold" and "A dealer done right can be the best distribution mechanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This strategy saved [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] money by avoiding a large, expensive sales force and fostered strong dealer loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. As one salesman noted, corporations that wanted a large order of IBM PCs would go directly to IBM for a discount, but for [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]], they *had* to come to the dealer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## The High

After the successful launch of the Deskpro 386 and leading the revolt of PC clone makers against IBM, [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] appeared to be performing exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Their instant success was widely admired, with business media praising their ability to select the right products at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Magazines like BusinessWeek published praise-filled profiles about [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]]'s seemingly unique business style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

In 1990, Rod Canion was interviewed by Harvard Business Review, which lauded the company's consensus-oriented culture and seemingly contradictory business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The review highlighted counterintuitive notions such as:
> "In an industry that is driven by innovation, [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] defines innovation as staying within the boundaries of accepted industry standards ..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
> "Because the companyâ€™s labor costs are so low, says the CEO, the company must hire its people very carefully ..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>
> "In a company that has achieved such remarkable financial results, cost ranks relatively low on the list of manufacturing priorities." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>

## Rise of the Clones

The modularity of the IBM PC ecosystem, similar to the Hard Disk Drive (HDD) industry, played a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. A PC is fundamentally a modular box with a keyboard and monitor, powered by an Intel chip on an IBM-derived hardware architecture, running Microsoft OS software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. In the early days of the PC clone industry, careful engineering was required to assemble these components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. However, by mid-1985, the ecosystem's quality improved to the point where components could be easily combined with few issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Ultimately, a computer's perceived performance hinged on Microsoft's OS software and Intel's silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

The Deskpro 386, an iconic computer, inspired a new generation of market entrants from the United States and East Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. It was easy for these companies to acquire a 386 chip and MS-DOS to introduce their own high-powered "super-clone" PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The Fall 1986 Comdex show, a major trade show, saw a multitude of 386-equipped PC clones, many of them prototypes hinting at a rush to market in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## New Innovations

[[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] was adept at quickly integrating new technologies into its computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. However, they produced few of these innovations themselves, investing only about 4% of revenues into R&D in the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This made them beholden to critical partners for their progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. For example, Rod Canion recounted confronting Intel's Andy Grove in late 1989 to prioritize the 486 chip, which Intel had temporarily sidelined for RISC development to compete with [[the_founding_and_early_growth_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This event illustrated [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]]'s reliance on its partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

Despite its success, [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] also missed opportunities in emerging markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. In early 1984, Rod Canion wanted [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] to produce a laptop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. However, market research indicated the market wasn't significant enough at the time, a decision Canion later cited as an example of their pursuit of "informational truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. When Toshiba released the successful Toshiba T3100 in 1986, signaling a market shift, [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] didn't introduce its own laptop, the SLT, until October 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Europe

Despite increasing competition and a lack of self-generated innovation, [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] continued to grow revenues and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. While other companies like Apple Computer and [[the_founding_and_early_growth_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] struggled against the "attack of the clones," [[Compaqs Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]]'s revenues multiplied five times over to $3 billion between 1986 and 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

The secret to this growth was the company's European operations, led by Eckhard Pfeiffer, a former Texas Instruments executive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Pfeiffer joined [[Compaqs Acquisitions and Their Impact | Compaq]] in 1983 and, with minimal guidance from the American HQ, successfully transplanted the dealer-only structure across the UK and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. [[Compaqs Acquisitions and Their Impact | Compaq]] spurred significant growth in this largely untapped market, which had been dominated by IBM, Apple, and Olivetti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. The British subsidiary turned a profit in its first month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Pfeiffer also established new subsidiaries across Europe and oversaw the construction of a factory in Scotland to reduce costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. By 1990, over half of [[Compaqs Acquisitions and Their Impact | Compaq]]'s revenues originated from abroad, primarily Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

[[rise_and_fall_of_daewoo_group | Daewoo Group]], once Korea's fourth-largest business conglomerate alongside Hyundai, Samsung, and LG, rocketed upwards due to a favorable political environment and "heaps of debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. However, the entire group disintegrated in a two-year span under the weight of its liabilities, a crushing recession, and widespread fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Debt as a Foundation for Growth
From its inception, Daewoo leveraged debt for rapid expansion. Kim Woo-joong, the founder, started Daewoo Industrial in 1967 with just $18,000 and four employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The company's de facto monopoly in textile exports provided cash flow for future expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Under President Park Chung-hee's administration, companies that aligned with strategic industries received favorable loans and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Daewoo was one such company, expanding into machinery, shipbuilding, construction, and automobiles primarily through acquisitions and joint ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Daewoo's close ties to the government and its practice of hiring government elites and retired state bankers allowed it to secure "absurdly favorable loans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. While annual inflation reached 40 percent and private banks charged much higher rates, Daewoo's loans were in the six to nine percent range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. These benefits came with the expectation that the chaebol would contribute "hundreds of millions of dollars" to the presidency's slush funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Structural Vulnerability and Moral Hazard
Despite a government mandate in the 1970s for chaebol to take their holding companies public to provide liquidity to Korean stock markets and allow public participation in economic efforts, Daewoo initially resisted, preferring bank funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. When they eventually complied, they established a complex cross-ownership structure, allowing the founder's family to maintain control despite diluting their economic shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. By 1997, Kim Woo-joong and his family owned, on average, only 6.1 percent of shares in [[rise_and_fall_of_daewoo_group | Daewoo Group]] companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. However, with subsidiaries owning about 30 percent of each other, Kim controlled an average of 38.3 percent of the votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This intricate structure and interlocking dependencies made it "difficult to figure out who was making money and who was losing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

The chaebol's reliance on debt was pervasive, with an average debt-to-equity ratio of 400 percent throughout the 1980s and 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. [[rise_and_fall_of_daewoo_group | Daewoo Group]] was particularly vulnerable because it carried the most debtâ€”over $11 billion into the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Unlike other chaebol with a "cash cow" core company, Daewoo's core, Daewoo Corporation, was a trading and financial entity focused on revenues over profits, funding its subsidiaries through borrowings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

### The 1988 Bailout and its Consequences
In 1988, Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery faced near-bankruptcy due to "high debt usage" and an "attitude of revenues over sales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The subsidiary carried about $1.8 billion in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Kim Woo-joong sought a bailout, arguing the shipyard acquisition was at Park Chung-hee's request and the Korea Development Bank had not provided promised equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

The government ultimately bailed out Daewoo Shipbuilding in 1989, providing 200 billion Korean Won in preferential loans and injecting another 50 billion Won directly into the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This "generous rescue plan" reaffirmed Daewoo's closeness to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This created a "moral hazard," where management believed they would not bear all the consequences if things went wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The bailout money for shipbuilding was likely used to fund Daewoo Motors' massive acquisition spree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## Escalating Debt and the Asian Financial Crisis
The [[impact_of_financial_crises_on_south_korean_business_practices | Asian Financial Crisis]] in 1997 had a devastating impact on Daewoo. The Korean Won plunged from 901 to 1961 against the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>, and the economy shrank nearly seven percent the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. While other chaebol pulled back, Daewoo "plunged ahead recklessly," discounting products and acquiring new companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This included the acquisition of SsangYong Motor Company in January 1998, which "added even more debt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

Throughout 1998, despite its "already considerable debts," Daewoo managed to raise another $14.1 billion, becoming "the nation's single most indebted company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. In the third quarter of 1998 alone, they added another 40% in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Investors likely believed the Korean government would eventually initiate another bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

However, the government, realizing the "financial contagion risk of a daewoo debt default" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, instructed financial institutions to limit [[rise_and_fall_of_daewoo_group | Daewoo Group]] debt holdings to five percent of their portfolio, effectively cutting off Daewoo's credit lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Kim Woo-joong's confidence that the government would ease off on chaebol reform and bail out Daewoo again proved misguided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

## Fraudulent Practices and Final Collapse
By late 1998, Daewoo agreed to a downsizing plan, consolidating 51 operating companies into 10, and aimed to reduce its debt ratio from 500 percent throughout 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. However, this "restructuring" lacked teeth, and creditor banks failed to withdraw funding despite the company not hitting its quarterly debt reduction targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

The reality was that by the end of 1998, Daewoo was already a bankrupt entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. While management reported a profit loss of half a trillion Korean Won, they argued core companies were profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. These "profits" were generated through "fictitious overseas asset sales" between sister subsidiaries at inflated prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. Without these fraudulent practices, Daewoo's loss was not half a trillion Won but eight times that amount, or four trillion Won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. Other estimates place the total fraud in 1997 and 1998 as high as 23 trillion Won, or about $19 billion, making it Korea's largest accounting fraud at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. The company was "insolvent, a dead man walking with far more liabilities than assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

In July 1999, Kim Woo-joong made a final attempt to save the company, offering his personal wealth as collateral and asking creditors to inject another 4 trillion Won (roughly $3.4 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. By August 1999, Kim was removed, and Daewoo's subsidiaries were placed into bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. At its collapse, Daewoo owed over $50 billion in debt to 140 banks in over 100 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

## Aftermath
The collapse led to banks and insurance companies losing trillions of Won, requiring the Korean government to inject public funds to prevent their collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. This precipitated extensive reforms in investor transparency and banking oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. The [[impact_and_aftermath_of_daewoos_accounting_fraud | accounting fraud]] also led to reforms in the Korean accounting industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.

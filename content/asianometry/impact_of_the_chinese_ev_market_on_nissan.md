Nissan's presence in China, once a key growth area, has been significantly impacted by the rapid rise of native Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. This shift has contributed to Nissan's current [[challenges_facing_nissan_in_the_automotive_industry | challenges]] and the push for a potential [[nissan_and_honda_merger | Nissan and Honda Merger]].

## Early Engagement and Growth in China

The booming Chinese automotive market was core to [[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Carlos Ghosn]]'s growth strategy for Nissan. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>
In 2000, Nissan established a joint venture (JV) called Fengshen Auto (風神, or "wind god") with state-owned Dongfeng Motor and two other car companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a> This JV was primarily a local assembly operation, producing Chinese variants of Nissan's popular Bluebird car with technical assistance from Taiwanese company Yulon. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a> Fengshen acquired a factory from its JV partner and generated 2 billion RMB in profits. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>

This early success led the Chinese government to seek a deeper partnership. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a> In September 2002, Ghosn negotiated a 50-50 partnership to produce passenger cars and trucks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a> Although the new JV, Dongfeng Nissan, initially faced a rocky start due to misaligned roles (Chinese workers in production, Japanese in sales), <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> these issues were rectified after a 10% sales decrease in 2004. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> By 2005, Dongfeng Nissan's sales exploded by 160%, making it the fastest-growing carmaker in China that year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a> It remained a top-10 carmaker in China for several years, competing with major JVs backed by Volkswagen and General Motors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>

## The Rapid Ascent of Chinese EV Natives

A significant unforeseen development was the fast and aggressive rise of Chinese EV native companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a> These companies approach car development, manufacturing, and sales like consumer electronics. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a> They are fueled by a powerful EV ecosystem and a massive domestic market that enables true economies of scale, allowing them to produce incredible products at hyper speed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>

For example, Xiaomi, a company known for phones, entered the EV market in 2021 and within three years, brought out "amazing cars." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a> Xiaomi's SU7 SUV utilizes scaled components pioneered by BYD, Huawei, and CATL for performance, and integrates its HyperOS operating system for customer differentiation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a> This allows the car to seamlessly connect with 1,000 different gadgets within Xiaomi's ecosystem, justifying its below-cost pricing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a> The Chinese EV industry is described as producing "one of the most formidable class of tech products to ever emerge from anywhere." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>

## Impact on Nissan in China

The "old guard" Chinese internal combustion engine joint ventures, including Dongfeng Nissan, have struggled to keep up with this rapid EV transition. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>
In 2023, Nissan's sales in China fell by approximately 30%, with similar declines projected for 2024. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a> The utilization rate at Nissan's seven factories in China is reportedly as low as 50%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>

China represents Nissan's top market, accounting for a third of its global sales. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a> This decline is not unique to Nissan, as Honda and Toyota also face intense competition in China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a> However, Nissan's internal management chaos, including tussles with Renault over shareholding deals, exacerbated the situation, described as "Fiddling while Rome burns." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>

Nissan's CEO Makoto Uchida acknowledged that China was a "wake-up call" for the company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a> While Nissan was an EV pioneer with the Leaf and Ghosn touted self-driving technology early on, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a> the company's execution in these areas was lacking, leading to missed opportunities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a> For instance, Nissan and Renault developed separate EV platforms (Leaf and ZOE), even disagreeing on battery technology, resulting in expensive cars and lost momentum. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>

## Conclusion

The impact of the Chinese EV market has been profound for Nissan, contributing significantly to its current predicament. What was once a key growth driver became a major liability as Nissan struggled to adapt to the rapid innovation and competitive pricing of Chinese native EV companies. This, coupled with internal challenges, has left Nissan facing a significant uphill battle to regain its footing in its largest market.

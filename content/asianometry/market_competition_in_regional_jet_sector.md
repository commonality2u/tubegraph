The commercial air travel industry utilizes three main types of planes: large jets (seating 100+ people), smaller turboprop planes, and regional jets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:32">[02:45:32]</a>. Regional jets occupy a middle ground, typically seating up to 100 passengers and capable of flying further than standard turboprop planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:19">[02:54:19]</a>. In the United States, these jets primarily transport passengers to large hub-and-spoke airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:19">[03:03:19]</a>.

## Established Players and Market Dynamics

The first regional jets emerged in the early 1990s, designed to replace an aging fleet of turboprop aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:07">[03:09:07]</a>. While the British Aerospace 146 was an early pioneer in this category, it ultimately lost significant market share to Canada's Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:11">[03:16:11]</a>. These two companies have historically held a majority share of the regional jet market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:21">[03:25:21]</a>.

## New Entrants and Increasing Competition

More recently, the regional jet market has seen increased competition from new entrants, including Russia's Sukhoi Superjet 100 and China's [[comparison_between_mitsubishi_spacejet_and_chinas_arj21 | COMAC ARJ21]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:16">[03:29:16]</a>. These new players aimed to capitalize on what was anticipated to be a growing market, at least before 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:23">[03:38:23]</a>.

## Mitsubishi's Entry with the SpaceJet

Japanese industry observers also identified an opportunity to establish a significant presence in this technology space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:03">[03:44:03]</a>. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, leading the project, aimed for a 20% market share of the projected 4,500+ unit market for 70 to 90-seat regional jets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:08">[05:26:08]</a>. The [[history_of_mitsubishi_regional_jet | Mitsubishi Regional Jet]] (later rebranded as the [[history_of_mitsubishi_regional_jet | Mitsubishi SpaceJet]]) was positioned as a high-tech, stylish passenger jet offering comfort, spacious overhead bins, and large windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:03">[05:44:03]</a>.

A key competitive claim for the [[history_of_mitsubishi_regional_jet | Mitsubishi Regional Jet]] was its fuel efficiency. Designed to "sip fuel" at a time when fuel was a significant airline expense, Mitsubishi claimed a 20-30% fuel reduction compared to its competitors, touting it as the "world's greenest craft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:11">[05:53:11]</a>.

### Competitive Challenges and Delays

The market's evolution and competitive landscape directly impacted the [[history_of_mitsubishi_regional_jet | SpaceJet]] program:
*   **Fuel Advantage Erosion**: Critically, the [[impact_of_delays_on_mitsubishi_spacejet | MRJ's]] release schedule faced issues when Embraer's E2 series was set to launch around the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:09">[14:41:09]</a>. Both planes utilized the same Pratt & Whitney engine, which effectively eliminated the [[history_of_mitsubishi_regional_jet | MRJ's]] claimed 20% fuel consumption advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:04">[14:47:04]</a>.
*   **Cost Pressures**: Due to high part costs, Mitsubishi had to significantly raise its sales target from 1,000 to 1,500 units, with a break-even point of 750 planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:11">[12:37:11]</a>.
*   **Scope Clauses**: Mitsubishi rebranded and reworked the [[history_of_mitsubishi_regional_jet | MRJ70]] into the [[history_of_mitsubishi_regional_jet | SpaceJet M100]] in response to concerns from its largest customers, primarily American regional airlines like [[impact_of_delays_on_mitsubishi_spacejet | SkyWest]] and Trans States Holdings (which held 70% of the order book) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:06">[17:15:06]</a>. These airlines operate under agreements with major carriers that include "scope clauses," which limit an airplane's seat number and maximum takeoff weight to protect major airline pilots' earnings from cheaper regional flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:36">[17:35:36]</a>. This redesign naturally impacted the delivery schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:06">[18:01:06]</a>.

## Comparison with China's ARJ21

A comparison between the [[history_of_mitsubishi_regional_jet | Mitsubishi SpaceJet]] and China's [[comparison_between_mitsubishi_spacejet_and_chinas_arj21 | ARJ21]] highlights the challenges in aircraft development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31:07">[19:31:07]</a>. The [[comparison_between_mitsubishi_spacejet_and_chinas_arj21 | ARJ21]] made its maiden flight in 2008, six years after its program began in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:10">[19:36:10]</a>. The [[history_of_mitsubishi_regional_jet | SpaceJet]] reached its maiden flight milestone in a similar timeframeâ€”six years after its 2008 project start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>. The [[comparison_between_mitsubishi_spacejet_and_chinas_arj21 | ARJ21]]'s first commercial flight occurred in 2016, eight years after its maiden flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:36">[19:48:36]</a>. The [[history_of_mitsubishi_regional_jet | SpaceJet]] might have had a chance to surpass this if not for the global pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:19">[19:54:19]</a>.

Recently, there has been significant discussion surrounding SMIC, China's semiconductor national champion, and their production of chips using their "own" seven-nanometer process node, dubbed N+2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This development is set against a backdrop of increasing [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_semiconductor_industry | export bans]] and trade tensions affecting the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## SMIC's N+2 Node and 7nm Technology

The term "seven nanometers" in process node numbers is primarily a marketing device, indicating an improvement in power, performance, or area compared to previous generations, rather than a literal physical dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. SMIC's N+2 node is a progression from their N+1 process, which first taped out in October 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Both N+1 and N+2 utilize DUV immersion lithography with multi-patterning, a technique commonly used by foundries before the widespread adoption of EUV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

SMIC's N+2 node is technically capable of using EUV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. However, the United States has imposed an [[impact_of_american_sanctions_on_chinese_technology | export ban]] on EUV devices from ASML, preventing SMIC from acquiring them and thus blocking this part of their roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Industry analysts have noted that SMIC's N+2 is "99% the same" as TSMC's N7 node, particularly in the physical measurements and placements of its transistors (finfets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. TSMC began shipping N7 chips in high volume in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This places SMIC approximately four to six years behind the leading edge in high-volume production of an N7 equivalent node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. While N+2 is one of the most advanced processes offered by any foundry, its economic competitiveness without EUV is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Foundries with EUV hold economic advantages over those relying solely on DUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Furthermore, an N7 equivalent node relying only on multi-patterning has manufacturing limitations that impose significant design restrictions on chip designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Economic Viability and Trade Secrets

In an open market, SMIC's N+2 node is likely not economically viable due to the existence of superior performing N7 equivalent nodes like TSMC's N6, which is an evolution of N7 and equipped with EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

SMIC's N+2 is so similar to TSMC's N7 that it likely infringes on trade secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. TSMC previously successfully sued SMIC in US courts in 2002 and 2006, resulting in product import bans on SMIC products made with TSMC trade secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. A repeat of such legal action could remove N+2's viability as an export product, limiting its use to domestic Chinese products and exports to friendly countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. While SMIC values its export capabilities to countries like the United States, they may no longer depend on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Domestic Chinese Market and Production Volume

The Chinese chip design and electronics industries have matured significantly since the mid-2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. HiSilicon, Huawei's chip design arm and formerly China's largest semiconductor company, is a strong candidate to utilize N+2 for high-performing Chinese mobile processors and server chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. HiSilicon was a flagship customer of TSMC, familiar with N7 node, and can bring serious production volume to SMIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Foundries heavily rely on massive production volumes to scale and yield-optimize their process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The collaboration between HiSilicon and SMIC could significantly improve N+2 over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Leadership and Policy Priority

China has prioritized leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing since the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. A key figure in this push is SMIC co-CEO Liang Bong-song, a TSMC alumnus known for his technical brilliance and relentless pursuit of the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Upon joining SMIC in 2017, he reoriented the company from a "boring Second Source manufacturer" to a leading-edge focused entity, bringing with him a 200-person R&D team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. As long as Liang remains at SMIC, the company is expected to continue its drive towards the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## Current Export Control Efforts

Access to the latest lithography technologies is critical for SMIC's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The United States government has been pressuring the Netherlands (ASML) and Japan (Nikon) to prevent the [[impact_of_export_bans_and_political_influence_on_chinese_semiconductor_industry | export of their immersion DUV lithography machines to China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This push coincides with SMIC's N+2 shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. While the US has long blocked the export of advanced EUV machines to China, expanding the block to immersion lithography represents a significant escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

Immersion machines improve the resolution of older 193-nanometer ARF laser technology by using water and other fluids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. They are crucial to modern semiconductor manufacturing and have been on the market since 2003, with ASML and Nikon being the only current suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Although dry 193-nanometer ARF machines can be modified into immersion lithography machines, it requires substantial technical effort and expertise, adding to the timeline for an N7 equivalent node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

As of this writing, Japan and the Netherlands have not formally decided on a ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. The Chinese government has responded with accusations of unfairness, questioning the concept of free markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Historically, governments protect nationally important industries; Europe protects automobiles, China protects telecom and internet, and America has protected computing technology since the Cold War era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. [[Impact of government policies and military demand on semiconductor innovation | Export control agreements]] to prevent American technologies from reaching unfriendly countries have been debated for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

### Impact of Potential DUV Ban

A ban on 193-nanometer immersion lithography technology, without a corresponding ban on dry ARF technology (which seems unfeasible), would likely add four to six years to SMIC's progress toward the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. However, such a ban is also expected to stimulate substantial investment in Chinese-made lithography, initially for maintaining existing immersion equipment and then for facilitating the dry-to-immersion transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. While it's debatable if Chinese companies can ever ship complete systems on par with ASML or Nikon, the gap, though several years, is not insurmountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## China's Achievement and American Response

A legitimate seven-nanometer node at high volume and good yield represents a triumph for China's advanced manufacturing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Only three other companies have reached this level of scale and sophistication, making it an accomplishment for China to be proud of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

For the United States, any successful immersion ban would not be a permanent blow, but rather a measure to maintain and slightly expand the Sino-American semiconductor gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. The US administration values these additional years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. The American response to the Japanese semiconductor challenge over 30 years ago serves as a historical example: government involvement bought time, but the industry itself had to innovate, build new markets, improve manufacturing, and adopt new suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The current situation demands a similar self-gathering and improvement from the American semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

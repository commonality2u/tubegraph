[[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Laboratories]] was founded and defined by the singular genius of its founder, [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | An Wang]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. An incredible engineer and brilliant businessman, Wang's ability to create the future drove the company's rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Early Innovations and Core Memory

After receiving his PhD from Harvard, [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | An Wang]] joined the Harvard Computation Lab, working on the Mark 1, one of the world's most powerful computers at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. His focus was on the challenge of storing and reading large amounts of information without clumsy mechanical steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

At the time, data was stored on magnetic tapes, but reading the information would demagnify and destroy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]]'s key insight, realized during a walk through Harvard Yard, was that destroying information during reading didn't matter if it could be immediately rewritten without sacrificing speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This concept was later integrated into magnetic core memory, also known as core memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Core memory succeeded the magnetic drum and was the ancestor of modern RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

In 1949, [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]] applied for a patent for this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This patent application, however, angered his Harvard colleagues who believed such knowledge should be for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Early [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Laboratories]] Products and Consulting

After founding [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Laboratories]] in 1951, [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]] began by producing and selling core memories for about four dollars each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. He also performed custom consulting jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. A notable deal included a consulting agreement with IBM in 1953, which also provided a future option for IBM to buy his patent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

In 1955, IBM paid [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]] between $400,000 and $500,000 (roughly $4.4 to $5.5 million today) for his patent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This money allowed [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]] to shift from consulting towards product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Entry into Calculators

### Linusac
In the early 1960s, [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]] partnered with Compugraphic, a Boston-based company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Compugraphic had an idea for a machine that justified lines of text for publishing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]] helped design and produce this machine, which Compugraphic sold as the Linusac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The Linusac, named for "line per second," was a hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

### Logarithmic Calculating Instrument (LOCI)
In 1964, [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]] sought to capitalize on the calculator industry's shift from mechanical to solid-state, transistor-based electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. He aimed to produce a calculator with Mainframe computer capabilities but significantly smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

[[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]] and a colleague developed a patented transistor logic capable of deriving the natural logarithmic value of any number using just six natural logarithmic values (10, 0.9, 1.01, 0.999, and 1.0001), which could be easily stored in ROM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This innovation led to the Logarithmic Calculating Instrument (LOCI), which debuted in January 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. The LOCI, looking like a typewriter fused to a box, was small yet powerful, capable of finding advanced logarithms with fewer than 300 logic transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. It sold well to science labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Wang 300 Calculator
Recognizing the LOCI's complex, intimidating keyboard, [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]] developed the Wang 300 calculator, introduced in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The Wang 300 was an immediate hit, being easy to use and costing just $1,695 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. It sold not only to scientists but also to stockbrokers and insurance companies on Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The Wang 300 famously revealed a calculating error in a bond trading table that had been in use for three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Transition to Computers and Word Processors

### Wang 700
In 1968, the emergence of the BASIC computer language convinced [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]] that computers were the next big thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Following Hewlett-Packard's announcement of their HP 9100 calculator (which was essentially a computer), [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]] rushed out the Wang 700 in mid-1969 as a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Like the HP 9100, the Wang 700 was called a "calculator" rather than a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. A year after its production, the 700 became [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Laboratories]]' most important product, driving revenues to $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

### Wang 3300 Basic
Alongside the 700, [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]] also developed the Wang 3300 Basic, a more traditional general-purpose computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. Reaching the market in 1970, this "calculating computer" was not successful, taking 40 minutes to program and requiring programs to be loaded via paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

### Wang 1200 Word Processor
Recognizing IBM's dominance but lack of attention in the word processing market, [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]] aimed to create a word processor to replace IBM's Magnetic Tape Selectric electric typewriter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. The first iteration, the Wang 1200 word processor (or Model 1200), was announced in November 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. It was essentially a modified Wang 700 calculator connected to an IBM Selectric typewriter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Initial reliability problems due to improper components in the connection to the typewriter led to slumping sales, though these issues were eventually fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## The Resurgence: Key Products of the 1970s

Despite the challenges, three products brought [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Laboratories]] back from the brink.

### Wang 2200
In May 1973, [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]] released the 2200, a successor to its 3300 Basic calculator/computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. The 2200 maintained BASIC for easy programmability but stored program information on Intel's ROM chips, allowing for instant wake capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Priced affordably between $6,000 and $8,000, the 2200 became a capable small business computer and sold extremely well for a decade and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

### Wang Word Processing System (WPS)
Learning from the 1200's shortcomings, [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]] tasked Harold Koplao and David Morris in September 1975 to redesign the word processing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. They created a powerful, upgradable, and radically easy-to-use system from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Key innovations included:
*   A network of powerful machines, each with its own Intel 8080 microprocessor, capable of independent work but also sharing texts or sending documents to a central storage unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
*   Ditching the reliance on IBM's Selectric and instead using a CRT screen to display words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
*   Simplifying the user interface by incorporating built-in prompts and a menu system for navigation, eliminating the need for secretaries to learn various codes for editing or formatting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

Introduced in 1976, the Wang Word Processing System (WPS) was an immediate hit, bringing the company back from the brink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. By the late 1970s, [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Laboratories]] was the world's largest supplier of CRT-based word processing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

### VS Minicomputer
In 1977, [[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | Wang]]'s third major product, the VS minicomputer, was introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. Minicomputers were smaller and cheaper than IBM's large mainframes and did not require a large team of technicians, yet they were powerful enough to run commercial applications like spreadsheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Competing against Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX line, the VS held its own, being almost as powerful as a mainframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. These three products generated billions for [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Laboratories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

## Later Product Challenges and Decline

Despite the initial success of its products, [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Laboratories]] faced significant [[challenges_and_decline_of_wang_laboratories | challenges and decline]] stemming from product missteps and [[impact_of_family_dynamics_on_wang_laboratories | family dynamics]].

### Wang Professional Image Computer
In October 1983, [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Laboratories]] announced 14 new products, including the Wang Professional Image Computer, armed with image processing technology to manage images in real time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. Other products included Wang Office, a software product enabling communication between different machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. However, all these products were significantly delayed, some by years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. This "vaporware" badly hurt the company's credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

### Resistance to the IBM PC
[[an_wangs_journey_from_china_to_success_in_america | An Wang]] notably resisted the personal computer (PC) revolution, viewing it as another calculator—a future dead-end commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. While his son, Fred [[impact_of_family_dynamics_on_wang_laboratories | Wang]], eventually pushed the company to build its own PC, it lacked compatibility with the IBM PC's massive software ecosystem, rendering it "Dead on Arrival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. This failure to embrace the PC revolution and office software was a major factor in [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Labs']] troubles, as its specialized word processors and 2200 computers were eroded by PCs equipped with word processing and spreadsheet software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

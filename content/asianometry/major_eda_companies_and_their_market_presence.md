[[Electronic Design Automation EDA software | Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software]] is a critical tool for chip designers, without which many of today's most advanced chips cannot be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Even major foundries like TSMC or Samsung use [[Electronic Design Automation EDA software | EDA software]] to verify newly arrived designs for compatibility with their rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This testing, or design rule checking, is crucial, as an error could cost millions of dollars if it proceeds to the fabrication stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Evolution of EDA Tools

In the early stages of chip design, up to the 1970s, designs were drawn by hand on paper and then transferred to photo masks made of ruby lith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. As chips grew in complexity, simple software tools were developed in-house by large companies to assist in the design process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. These early tools automated the placement of blocks and wires on circuit boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

The advent of reasonably priced storage tube class CRT screens in the 1980s made the [[Electronic Design Automation EDA software | EDA]] industry more accessible to designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The industry also pioneered new approaches to chip design, such as the "standard cell" style, where designers choose from a library of standardized gates and decide how they are wired together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This approach allowed the design process to split into separate logical and layout functions, abstracting away low-level details and enabling [[Electronic Design Automation EDA software | EDA software]] to consistently create correct designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Leading EDA Companies

Over time, software firms providing [[Electronic Design Automation EDA software | EDA tools]] consolidated, as tasks became harder and required integration across various stages of the design cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Their proprietary libraries often became the de facto standard for the entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

The two leading companies in the [[Electronic Design Automation EDA software | EDA]] space are:

*   **Cadence** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>
*   **Synopsis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>

Both companies are based in the United States and are publicly traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. As of the transcript, Cadence had a market capitalization of $34 billion, and Synopsis $36 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Market Position and Business Model
These two companies are the result of a long series of acquisitions and have been involved in the industry for a significant period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. They have formed alliances with major players like TSMC and Samsung Foundry to help transition chips from design to the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. New fabless companies looking to enter the semiconductor industry typically need to acquire bundles of software tools from these [[Electronic Design Automation EDA software | EDA vendors]], which can cost millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

Beyond [[Electronic Design Automation EDA software | EDA tools]], these companies own a significant amount of Intellectual Property (IP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. They generate revenue by licensing out useful IP blocks for standard chip functions, such as I/O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This business model, relying on software subscriptions and IP licensing, results in strong gross margins and cash flows, allowing them to invest heavily in research and development (R&D) to further extend their advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Their market positions are considered "pretty rock solid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## Challengers and Alternatives

Despite the dominance of Cadence and Synopsis, a few entities are challenging the incumbents:
*   **Google**: Reportedly developed their own [[Electronic Design Automation EDA software | EDA tool]] to design a recent YouTube chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Chinese Alternatives**: Companies like Empyrean and Celixoff have gained increased attention, partly due to the U.S.-China trade war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Open-Source EDA Tools**: Efforts exist for open-source [[Electronic Design Automation EDA software | EDA tools]], such as those for RISC-V designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

As of now, these alternative efforts remain "undeveloped and lag the market leaders" for [[Electronic Design Automation EDA software | EDA]]-enabled chip design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Future Developments

Exciting new developments are on the horizon for [[Electronic Design Automation EDA software | EDA]]. Programmers are applying machine learning to [[Electronic Design Automation EDA software | EDA software]], showing promising results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. For example, machine learning can help [[Electronic Design Automation EDA software | EDA tools]] find optimal routes for wires between chip circuits or simulate photo mask designs during lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Vendors are also experimenting with new techniques to adapt to the industry trend of Systems on Chip (SoC) designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

In conclusion, without [[Electronic Design Automation EDA software | EDA software]], the cost of creating new chip designs would soar even faster than they already do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. [[Electronic Design Automation EDA software | EDA tools]] are a critical part of the industry, and today's advanced chips would not exist without them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

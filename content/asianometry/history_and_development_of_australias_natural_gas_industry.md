Australia has emerged as the world's leading exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), shipping $25 billion worth of natural gas to Asian markets in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Despite this global leadership, Australia occasionally experiences [[domestic_natural_gas_shortages_in_australia | natural gas shortages domestically]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This paradox highlights the country's vast size, abundant natural resources, and complex energy politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Natural Gas Reserves in Australia
Australia possesses significant proven natural gas reserves, estimated at approximately 3 trillion cubic meters in conventional fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. When factoring in unconventional gas sources like coal seam gas and shale gas, the total potential reserves could be as high as 12 trillion cubic meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. However, much of this gas is unevenly distributed, with about 80% of conventional resources concentrated in the country's northwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Historically, Australia's primary export was coal, with natural gas production reserved for domestic use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Coal mining in Australia dates back to the 1800s, with exports beginning after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Currently, Australia is the world's second-largest coal exporter, trailing only Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The country's first commercial gas field became operational in the 1960s, with natural gas quickly recognized as a premium fuel due to its low pollutant characteristics compared to coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Understanding Natural Gas
Natural gas is a complex mixture primarily composed of methane, along with other hydrocarbons and non-hydrocarbons such as hexane, ethane, propane, butane, and hydrogen sulfide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It is odorless, colorless, and lighter than air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Scientists believe natural gas forms from organic matter trapped within sediment deposits over millions of years, migrating from source rock to underground reservoir rock formations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

Natural gas fields are categorized into two types:
*   **Conventional Gas:** Free gas trapped in porous reservoir rocks like carbonates, sandstones, and salt stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Unconventional Gas:** An umbrella term for other types, generally more difficult to extract. Examples include shale gas (trapped in tiny pores within shale rock deep underground) and coal seam gas (absorbed and trapped in coal deposits near the surface) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Challenges of Natural Gas Transport
One of the primary difficulties with natural gas is its transportation, as reserves are often located far from population centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Pipelines:** Used for almost a century, pipelines are convenient and economical for shorter distances but lack flexibility and can be politically controversial, especially for intercontinental projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG):** For longer distances (beyond 700 miles overseas or 2,200 miles on land), LNG becomes more economical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Natural gas is cooled to -260 degrees Fahrenheit, turning it into a condensed liquid that occupies 1/600th of its original volume, making it easier to transport via tanker ships or trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The major drawback of LNG is the high upfront cost of building expensive liquefaction plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Australia's Fragmented Pipeline System
Australia, despite its vast size, lacks an integrated nationwide gas pipeline system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Its 47,000-kilometer network is divided into three largely separate subsystems: the northern, western, and eastern markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Each market relies on local natural gas fields and separate pipeline systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This patchwork system, a result of physical distance and varying regulatory regimes, contributes to a significant national [[domestic_natural_gas_shortages_in_australia | energy security problem]], preventing gas from being efficiently moved from areas of plenty to areas of need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## The Push Towards Exports and the Northwest Shelf Venture
In the 1960s and 1970s, new natural gas discoveries, particularly a large field in central Australia, attracted foreign interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This sparked economic nationalism, leading Australia's federal government in 1970 to impose a general export embargo on LNG, aiming to ensure domestic requirements were met first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Northwest Shelf Project
The Northwest Shelf project began as a joint venture involving Australian companies (like Woodside Petroleum and Mid-Eastern Oil) and foreign multinationals (Burma Oil, Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, and California Asiatic Oil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. After years of limited success and changes in partnership, significant natural gas was discovered in 1971 at Scott Reef, followed by large discoveries at North Rankin and Goodwin, approximately 80 miles off the coast of Dampier, Western Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. These fields contained over 300 billion cubic meters of natural gas, far exceeding Western Australia's domestic needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

The joint venture proposed a massive $12 billion project to develop these resources, build an LNG plant, and export LNG globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. However, the nationwide natural gas export ban remained in effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The left-wing federal government at the time also sought at least 50% local ownership of the project, resenting foreign multinational involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Due to the ban and the small size of the Western Australian market, the project could not proceed without export capabilities, and an integrated pipeline system to connect to Australia's eastern markets was economically unfeasible given the vast distances (e.g., 3,202 miles from Dampier to Sydney) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

The Whitlam federal government proposed building a national pipeline grid and took over an ongoing pipeline project from Moomba to Sydney in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This project faced significant political and environmental challenges, taking three years to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Lifting the Export Ban and Project Commencement
Political tides shifted in 1975 when a more right-leaning, business-friendly government came to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Obstacles to the Northwest Shelf project began to fall away:
*   The venture naturally met the 50% local ownership threshold after Burma Oil sold its stake to the Australian mining giant BHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   In 1977, the federal government lifted the export embargo, allowing the Northwest Shelf venture to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The government stated it would permit "reasonable quantities of gas" for export only after domestic requirements were considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Initially, the venture was allowed to export 50% of its gas production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   The Western Australian state government enthusiastically supported the project, as it would provide natural gas for Perth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. State governments in the eastern markets, however, were disheartened, having hoped for a national gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   The new government also introduced tax benefits, extending an investment allowance, providing an income tax rebate, and waiving certain oil and resource taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

In 1978, the venture secured deals with eight major Japanese customers to supply LNG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Buoyed by favorable oil market conditions following the Iranian Revolution, construction began in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Northwest Shelf: A Megaproject
The Northwest Shelf venture was Australia's largest project to date and, for a period, the world's single biggest engineering project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Built in two phases, it included:
*   Offshore platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>
*   Undersea gas pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>
*   A massive LNG plant capable of processing 12 million tons of natural gas annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>
*   $800 million (AUD) worth of LNG tankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>
*   A pipeline from Dampier to Perth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>

While the LNG tankers were built abroad, over 75% of the other project materials were locally sourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The first LNG exports to Japan commenced in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Japan has remained a consistent customer, later joined by the People's Republic of China, with the two countries together purchasing 75% of Australia's LNG output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Today, the gas fields of Western Australia continue to account for about 80% of the country's proven reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Over $25 billion has been invested in the project, including the Gorgon Gas Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. The Northwest Shelf project has significantly benefited Western Australia, as a portion of its production is legally reserved for domestic use, supplying 64% of the state's energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## The Rise of Unconventional Gas and Export Expansion
Australia's other two markets, particularly the eastern market encompassing major cities like Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Hobart, face larger supply [[challenges_in_transporting_and_distributing_natural_gas_in_australia | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Domestic energy demand is growing rapidly, with consumption increasing by about 0.6% annually, primarily driven by industrial demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Despite its relatively small population (55th largest globally), Australia ranks 19th in electricity consumption per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

Australia's energy mix has shifted towards renewables, with wind and solar energy contributions surging from 2% in 2010 to 18% in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Renewables have primarily displaced coal, which fell from 81% to 67% of the energy mix, and to a lesser extent, natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

The growing domestic energy demand incentivized new developments in unconventional natural gas, particularly coal seam gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. While the southern and eastern regions lack conventional gas fields, they possess significant coal deposits with absorbed methane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Historically, this methane, a potent greenhouse gas (21 times higher global warming potential than CO2), was vented into the atmosphere during coal mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

Companies like Conoco Australia, Mitsubishi, and Houston Oil & Minerals attempted to harness this methane for commercial production throughout the 1970s and 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. In 1996, BHP successfully broke through at the Bowen Basin in Queensland, initiating a coal seam gas boom in eastern Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Gas production grew ninefold due to domestic eastern market growth, aided by state governments pushing for a switch from coal to gas, such as Queensland's 2005 scheme requiring electricity retailers to produce 13-15% of their electricity from gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

The export markets again beckoned. The Queensland state government approved three consortia to build LNG plants and export coal seam gas to Asian markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. The first of these plants, operated by Santos, came online in December 2014, followed by APLNG in January 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Today, three LNG plants operate from Curtis Island, with a combined capacity of 26 million tons of LNG annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This new capacity leveraged existing energy export infrastructure and eastern Australia's proximity to Asia, providing a price advantage despite higher labor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

## Australia's Current Position and Future Challenges
In 2020, [[australias_role_in_global_lng_exports | Australia dethroned Qatar]] as the world's leading exporter of liquefied natural gas, with the two countries remaining neck and neck for the top spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Australia's rise as a natural gas export power, combined with its reputation as a reliably Western-aligned country, has helped stabilize global energy markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

Despite its export success, Australia's domestic markets face significant energy shortages and rising prices, impeding growth and causing political challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Ideas like a transcontinental pipeline or a nationwide gas reservation policy are discussed, but there is no single solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Resolving Australia's natural gas dilemma will require incorporating these ideas into a coherent nationwide strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

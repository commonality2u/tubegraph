India was one of the first countries to advocate for a global ban on nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. In 1947, Mahatma Gandhi stated that nuclear weapons were a "sinful and diabolical use of science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Following the Japanese atomic bombings, India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, expressed concerns that the bomb would primarily be "a weapon only for killing Asians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. India's official stance was a desire for a world free of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Despite this strong advocacy, India became the sixth declared nuclear power on May 18, 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This shift in policy and eventual detonation reflects a complex journey influenced by domestic needs, regional geopolitics, and a strategic desire to keep nuclear options open.

## Nehru's Dual Approach

While publicly a fierce opponent of nuclear weapons, Prime Minister Nehru also understood the geopolitical realities and sought to maintain India's option to develop them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. He granted [[role_of_dr_homi_bhabha_in_indias_nuclear_development | Dr. Homi Bhabha]], the architect of India's nuclear program, the autonomy to establish the necessary infrastructure for a potential future weapon program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Nehru's primary interest in nuclear science was its potential to accelerate India's [[development_and_expansion_of_indias_nuclear_program_including_international_relations | development and prestige]], providing new energy sources for industrialization and economic advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## External Influences and Growing Pressures

### Sino-Indian War of 1962

The humiliating Sino-Indian War in October 1962, where the People's Liberation Army overran India's positions, served as a significant catalyst for India to reassess its defense capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. In response, India doubled its military budget in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. This conflict led to the first public call from a parliamentary party, the right-wing Jana Sangh Party, for India to build the bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

Despite these calls, Nehru maintained his stance against actively pursuing the bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. He questioned the sincerity of India developing nuclear weapons while simultaneously urging other nuclear powers to halt their tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. However, he continued to increase state support for atomic programs, raising the budget by 76% in 1963, thereby keeping India's nuclear options open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. Nehru consistently believed that nuclear bombs would not contribute to India's growth, though he acknowledged that their necessity might arise one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

### China's Nuclear Test (1964)

The announcement and subsequent [[chinas_indigenous_nuclear_weapon_development | Chinese nuclear weapon test]] on September 29, 1964, had a profound impact on the Indian political class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. China had been open about its bomb development since 1958, and Soviet assistance made the test inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. This event intensified the internal debate within India's ruling Congress Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.

[[role_of_dr_homi_bhabha_in_indias_nuclear_development | Dr. Bhabha]] actively pushed for India to build the bomb, publicly stating in London on October 4, 1964, that India was only 18 months away from a nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. Following the Chinese test on October 16, 1964, the Jana Sangh party escalated its rhetoric, criticizing the government for not pursuing the bomb earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.

### Economic and Political Concerns

Despite the calls for a nuclear weapon, many Indian elites, surveyed by the *Indian Express* in October 1964, urged caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. They highlighted the immense costs of a nuclear weapons program amidst rising inflation and severe food shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. While India's defense budget was substantial ($1.8 billion or 28% of total national spending in 1964), the atomic program itself, at $63 million or 1%, was still rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. [[role_of_dr_homi_bhabha_in_indias_nuclear_development | Bhabha]] attempted to downplay the costs, claiming that 50 atomic bombs would only cost $21 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. However, this figure was misleading as it excluded the costs of reactors, infrastructure, and delivery systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

Many also argued that China's nuclear weapons were aimed at "world powers" rather than India, noting China's restraint during the 1962 war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. For Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, who took over after Nehru's death in May 1964, the immediate priority was solving the food shortage crisis, not developing nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. He continued to advocate for a non-bomb policy, potentially relying on a nuclear umbrella from Western powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

### The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965

The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 brought the threat from Pakistan back to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. During the conflict, China, backing Pakistan, threatened India with nuclear retaliation, an ultimatum that India denied, and China eventually withdrew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. The war led to a cessation of military exports from the US to both India and Pakistan, eroding trust in the West's willingness to provide a nuclear umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>. This further fueled calls within India to build its own bomb, reinforcing the belief that India could only depend on itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.

## Path to Peaceful Nuclear Explosion

Despite the ongoing political debates, a peaceful nuclear explosion program was likely initiated by Shastri and [[role_of_dr_homi_bhabha_in_indias_nuclear_development | Bhabha]] in 1964 after the Chinese detonation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. However, [[role_of_dr_homi_bhabha_in_indias_nuclear_development | Bhabha]]'s death in a plane crash in January 1966, shortly after Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister, temporarily stalled the effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.

By 1968, scientists at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) began work on a practical implosion-type plutonium bomb design, initiated by the new Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) chairperson Homi Sethna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>. While Vikram Sarabhai, [[role_of_dr_homi_bhabha_in_indias_nuclear_development | Bhabha]]'s successor and nominal boss to Sethna, advocated for a large nuclear reactor expansion for civilian use and disliked nuclear weapons, he did not stop the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. Sarabhai's sudden death in December 1971 removed the last major political obstacle to a nuclear explosion test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.

In January 1972, technical teams at BARC began preliminary work on assembling the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. By September 1972, Sethna received formal approval from Indira Gandhi to finalize the device and find an underground test site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. The chosen site was the Thar desert in Rajasthan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.

The explosion, codenamed "Smiling Buddha," occurred on May 18, 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Indira Gandhi, while initially appearing against a weapon in 1966, ultimately gave the final approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. She later stated that the Peaceful Nuclear Explosion (PNE) was conducted when the scientists were ready, denying any political motivation, including upcoming elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

## Aftermath and Conclusion

India's 1974 nuclear explosion had significant ramifications for non-proliferation efforts globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>. India became the first country to use civilian nuclear energy technology to develop a bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>. This led to new international controls on nuclear technology to prevent similar occurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. The international backlash, particularly from Canada, surprised both the Indian scientists and the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. Consequently, India did not conduct another detonation for two decades, and full-scale production of actual nuclear weapons began much later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. Nonetheless, India asserted its right to the Bomb as a Great Power, a stance that remained consistent throughout its program's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

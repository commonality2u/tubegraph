The ongoing semiconductor shortage is primarily impacting **trailing edge semiconductors**, which are older, less "sexy" chips compared to the latest leading-edge technology like extreme ultraviolet lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. These "unheralded workhorses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> are essential for automation, metering, and industrial manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Defining Trailing Edge Nodes

The definition of a trailing edge node can vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>:
*   **TSMC** classifies anything at 16 nanometers or older as trailing edge, accounting for roughly 50% of 2021 revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Mature nodes** are generally considered in the 40 to 450 nanometer range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Legacy nodes** are anything older than that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   Most microcontrollers, such as the Microchip Technology ATSAMD21 MCU, are made with a 110 or 180 nanometer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Globally, there are approximately 200 fabs operating, most of which were built before 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. While initially built for leading-edge chips with high margins, these fabs' products quickly commoditize as the industry advances, but they can remain operational as long as market prices exceed their variable costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Current Supply Challenges

Fab capacity at trailing edge nodes was already relatively tight for several years before the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The initial COVID-19 lockdowns in early 2020 led to automotive companies and other manufacturers halting production and cancelling orders, causing suppliers like ST Microelectronics to cut production by 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

However, a massive, unexpected economic bounce-back in the summer of 2020 led to widespread shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Companies depleted inventories, then began overbuying to replenish stocks and guarantee future output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Simultaneously, the broader [[the_volatility_of_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor industry]] experienced unprecedented demand driven by cloud computing, the 5G transition, and armed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Since 2019, fab utilization rates have consistently been in the mid-90s, indicating that foundries are at their limit with existing fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Investment Hesitation and Challenges

Despite the clear need, [[the_economics_and_costs_of_building_semiconductor_fabs | building out trailing edge capacity]] has been slow, growing at about 2% annually compared to over 25% for leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Microchip executive chairman Steve Sanghi estimates that $150 billion in additional investment is needed over the next five years to meet trailing edge demand growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Yet, out of hundreds of billions of dollars committed to new fabs, only 6% is for mature or legacy node capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Trailing edge chipmakers have been hesitant to invest in new fabs for several reasons:
*   **Customer price expectations** Customers are accustomed to low prices set by foundries with fully depreciated fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Wafers for these nodes are very cheap, accounting for only 10% of total sales revenue despite significant microprocessor volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Risk of underutilization** Building new fabs for these nodes, even with heightened demand, is expected to lead to substantial underutilization and financial underperformance once the current boom subsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Equipment availability** Many foundries use older, niche equipment, such as for 200 millimeter wafers (smaller than the current 300 millimeter standard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. New 200 millimeter equipment is not readily available, and companies prefer refurbished items, leading to equipment shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### The 28-22 Nanometer Generation Gap

The 28 nanometer node is significant because it is likely the most advanced node still using a planar gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Newer nodes require more complex FinFET gates, rampant multi-patterning, and potentially EUV, all of which contribute to increased complexity, lower reliability, reduced yields, and higher costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. As such, 28 nanometers often represents the bottom of the cost curve on a per-100-million-gate basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Customers, particularly automotive companies who prioritize reliability and effectiveness and account for 40% of market demand, often do not need or want to move to faster, more complex nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

Additionally, some chip types, such as analog mixed-signal, radio frequency chips, and MEMS (specialty silicon found in accelerometers), do not scale well to newer nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Demand for these types of chips is currently very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Solutions and Investments

As backlogs for older nodes stretch to 18 months and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, the [[the_volatility_of_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor industry]] is beginning to respond:

### Building New Fabs
*   **TSMC** is building two new trailing edge fabs in Japan and Kaohsiung, operating on the 28-22 nanometer node range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. TSMC recently announced price increases on older nodes, likely to fund these new fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. They are also building an N5 plant in Arizona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Samsung** has committed to investing more in trailing edge semiconductor capacity, marking a significant shift from its historical focus on leading-edge technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's semiconductor manufacturing efforts]] are substantial, with up to a dozen new fabs under construction across the mainland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. SMIC, the leading Chinese foundry, is investing over $9 billion to add trailing edge wafer capacity in Shanghai and Shenzhen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. For more on this, see [[future_prospects_for_chinese_semiconductor_manufacturing | Future prospects for Chinese semiconductor manufacturing]] and [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | Comparison to global semiconductor leaders]].
*   **India** is also making moves, with the conglomerate Vedanta signing an MOU with Foxconn to build a trailing edge fab in the 65 to 28 nanometer range, supported by substantial [[government_subsidies_and_their_effects_on_the_semiconductor_industry | government support]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### Government Incentives
*   The [[us_semiconductor_industry_subsidies | US CHIPS Act]] authorized $2 billion specifically for "mature technology nodes" to incentivize construction and modernization in the American [[the_economics_and_costs_of_building_semiconductor_fabs | semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Improving Existing Fabs
Beyond building new facilities, the industry can improve existing trailing edge fabs:
*   **Wafer upgrades** Moving from 200 millimeter to 300 millimeter wafers can yield over two times as many dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. While a substantial undertaking requiring layout changes and automation, it doubles output without needing a new fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **Design-side improvements** New tools, such as open-source EDA software and Process Design Kits (PDKs) like the 130 nanometer PDK released by Google and SkyWater Technologies, can make hardware development cheaper and facilitate die shrinks onto other nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

These efforts will take time, with supply constraints for trailing edge nodes expected to continue until at least 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. However, signs of progress include slowing revenue growth for trailing edge nodes, increased investment from major players and countries like China and India, and a potential slowing in the macro economy which could dampen demand, allowing supply capacity to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

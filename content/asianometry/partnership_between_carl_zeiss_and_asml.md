[[history_of_carl_zeiss_ag | Carl Zeiss AG]], a Germany-based company, develops lenses and optics for advanced systems worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. When etching patterns the width of a small virus, these are considered "optics systems," massive multi-component systems at the heart of multi-million dollar photolithography machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Without these optics, [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] would have no machines for companies like TSMC, Samsung, or Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. [[asmls_partnerships_and_collaborations | Carl Zeiss]] is one of [[asmls_partnerships_and_collaborations | ASML's closest partners]], creating the optic systems that enable high-energy UV light to etch wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Carl Zeiss SMT

Carl Zeiss SMT is a joint venture between [[history_of_carl_zeiss_ag | Carl Zeiss AG]], which holds the majority share, and [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] itself, holding a 24.9% stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The core product of this company is the optics at the heart of the lithography scanners and steppers that [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] manufactures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. In 2020, the semiconductor division of [[history_of_carl_zeiss_ag | Carl Zeiss]] generated 1.8 billion euro in revenue, growing 12% year-over-year while other divisions saw declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. It contributes 30% of the group's business and holds critical strategic importance in German industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

## DUV Lithography Optics

Deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography uses ultraviolet light rays in the 193 nanometer or 248 nanometer range and powers the majority of process nodes today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

*   **Early Development**: [[history_of_carl_zeiss_ag | Carl Zeiss]] has been building deep ultraviolet imaging systems for nearly 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Carl Abba, a brilliant physicist recruited in 1866, had proposed the possibility of a microscope using ultraviolet light as early as 1874 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. By 1899, the company developed a quartz lens suitable for UV microscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. In the 1960s, the company began leveraging its microscope techniques to build the first-ever lenses for microlithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Optical Challenges**: Microlithography demands tight control over light distortions across a large space to ensure accurate transfer of IC designs onto silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. [[history_of_carl_zeiss_ag | Carl Zeiss]] combined multiple smaller lenses into massive optics systems, often with a "double bulge" or "funny looking bulge and waist structure," to reduce field curvature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, [[history_of_carl_zeiss_ag | Carl Zeiss]] adapted its microscope techniques to improve resolution for IC design projection onto wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Immersion Lithography**: In the 2000s, the discovery of immersion lithography, which replaces the air gap between the wafer and stepper with water, further improved resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. First proposed for semiconductor use by Taiwanese scientist Burn Lin, this technique allowed foundries to etch structures as small as 40 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Today, [[history_of_carl_zeiss_ag | Carl Zeiss]]'s top products for this technique are the Starlith 1900 series, including the 1900i, which are among their best-selling products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The company invested over 450 million euro into a new factory and overcame significant engineering challenges to build these optics systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

## EUV Lithography Optics

[[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography]] is the next step in the semiconductor fabrication roadmap, a disruptive technology for cutting-edge process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. The use of a new wavelength requires radical changes to the optics system because all available materials, including air, absorb high-energy UV light, making traditional lenses impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

*   **Mirror-Based System**: [[history_of_carl_zeiss_ag | Carl Zeiss]] had to craft an optic system entirely out of multi-layer mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. They began work on their [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] optic system with a micro exposure tool in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Collaborating with Lawrence Livermore National Lab and Berkeley Lab in California, they delivered the first prototype in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. The design was refined five times over the following years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Starlith 3100**: In 2015, the first full-field [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] optic system, named the Starlith 3100, was delivered to [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] for integration into their [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]] ADT NXE 3100 (Alpha Demo Tool) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Components**: The Starlith is a multi-component system consisting of:
    *   **Collector optics**: Gathers light from the [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] light source and projects it through an aperture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
    *   **Illumination optics**: Spreads the light evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
    *   **Reticle**: Reflects the uniformly illuminated light, containing the IC chip designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
    *   **Projection optics**: Projects the design onto the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Evolution**: The 3100 pioneered the optical system's core mechanics, which were later refined in subsequent releases like the Starlith 3300 and 3400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Today, it is a critical part of [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV based process nodes]] at seven nanometers or lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

[[history_of_carl_zeiss_ag | Carl Zeiss]] and [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]]'s partnership is unique, with [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]]'s competitors, Japan-based Nikon and Canon, making their own optics systems, an arrangement that has not worked as effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. The complexity of [[history_of_carl_zeiss_ag | Carl Zeiss]]'s DUV and [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] optic systems makes it challenging for any competitor to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

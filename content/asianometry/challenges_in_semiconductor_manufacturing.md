India is a significant powerhouse in semiconductor design, with almost every major semiconductor company having a presence there to design advanced chips. However, once designed, these chips are sent to countries like the United States, China, South Korea, or Taiwan for fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. India has historically struggled to establish its own semiconductor fabrication capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Historical Context: India's Early Attempts

In the 1980s, the Indian government sought to emulate countries like China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, and Singapore by creating its own semiconductor manufacturing national champion, India's Semiconductor Complex Limited (SCL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Despite a promising start, disaster struck, and the company, along with India's entire semiconductor manufacturing industry, has not recovered since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Earlier, in the mid-1960s, Fairchild Semiconductor considered building a factory in India but was deterred by the formidable Indian bureaucracy, opting instead for Malaysia and the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Key Factors for Semiconductor Manufacturing Success

Creating a successful, high-performing semiconductor factory depends on four main categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>:

1.  **Financial Capital**: Significant investment is required for expensive chip manufacturing equipment, especially in photolithography and chip testing, which also need constant upgrades and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. For India, much of this equipment must be imported from Europe or Japan, involving import duties and complex documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
2.  **Human Capital**: A skilled workforce, including engineers who can operate expensive equipment and PhDs for research and development, is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. India has a strong pool of talent in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
3.  **Government/Infrastructure**: Near 100% government buy-in, stable power, and water supply are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The manufacturing process is also quite toxic, necessitating environmental considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. India faces [[water_shortages_and_droughts_impact_on_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenges]] with infrastructure, where a single power outage or water shortage can ruin months of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
4.  **Manufacturing Technology**: To quickly catch up, companies need to acquire older process node technology through technology transfer deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. World-class semiconductor companies closely guard their technology, and transfers are almost always for older processes, never for leading-edge advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## SCL's Challenges and Failure

SCL started with sufficient financial capital, smart personnel, and government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. They licensed 5-micron process technology from American Microsystems Inc. (AMI) in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, and later acquired technology from Rockwell (for microprocessors) and Hitachi (for electronic wristwatch components) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This allowed SCL to advance quickly, reaching 0.8-micron process technology by the late 1980s, only one semiconductor generation behind the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### The Devastating Fire of 1989

In 1989, a devastating fire broke out at SCL, the cause of which remains unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. While some speculated arson due to military processor production, semiconductor fires are common, with insurance records from 1986-1995 showing them as a leading cause of operational losses due to flammable and toxic chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The fire, which likely triggered water sprinkler systems, caused extensive damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

It took SCL eight years and over $50 million USD for production to restart in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. During this period, new entrants like TSMC (founded 1987) and Samsung rapidly gained global market share and scale, leaving India far behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### Post-Fire Struggles and Restructuring

After the fire, the Indian government's proposals to recover lost ground largely failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Attempts to sell the fab failed due to disagreements with potential private investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Retooling the fab for smart card chips instead of telephone exchange chips also did not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

In 2005, SCL was restructured as an R&D center within the Department of Space, ending its chances of being a competitive commercial entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Even with government contracts, SCL could not turn a profit due to a lack of economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Financial and Technological Lag

Even before the fire, SCL faced financial strain from the costs of competing in the semiconductor business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. The costs of advancing to 800 nanometers forced them to drop projects like the BBC Acorn computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Talented SCL personnel also consistently left for better opportunities in the private sector or abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

Today, SCL's old 6-inch wafer fab primarily focuses on R&D, reaching the 180-nanometer node only in 2019, a process that took nearly a decade since 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. This is far from the leading edge, which currently involves fabs costing tens of billions of dollars, a trend that significantly ramped up around the 14-nanometer node generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

## Modern Challenges for India

The single most significant obstacle for India in establishing a viable semiconductor manufacturing industry is the sheer amount of capital required to build competitive and productive fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Even major private Indian entities find these costs difficult to bear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. For example, TSMC plans to spend $20 billion USD on just one gigafab over two years, while building three such facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This immense investment must yield returns in the volatile electronics market, which is not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

Despite repeated government attempts to revive the industry, all efforts have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   A 2006 "Fab City" project for manufacturing faced setbacks, with AMD pulling out due to poor industry conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   In 2013, customs duties were lifted on imports of semiconductor manufacturing parts and machinery, but this did not stimulate foundry efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   In 2014, two investor groups, including one with TowerJazz and IBM, were approved to build fabs costing $10 billion, with substantial government financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. However, one consortium pulled out in 2016 due to debt and commercial non-viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. The other consortium, led by Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (HSMC) with expertise from STMicroelectronics and Siltera, also failed by 2019 due to lack of commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

India currently lacks substantial semiconductor fabrication capacity, importing 100% of its chips (logic, memory, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. In 2019, India imported $21 billion worth of semiconductors, a number growing by about 15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. This dependency led to disruptions during the 2020 worldwide semiconductor shortage, affecting critical Indian businesses like smartphone manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. A significant portion of these imports (37% in 2019) comes from China, raising geopolitical concerns given the tense Sino-Indian relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

For India, the market has long passed the phase where a private entity can seed a thriving semiconductor manufacturing industry without external government assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Consistent, long-term government direction and substantial financial commitment are crucial for India to catch up in semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

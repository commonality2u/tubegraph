Trailing edge semiconductors, often referred to as "workhorses," are crucial components used in a wide range of applications such as automation, metering, and industrial manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Unlike the "sexy leading-edge" chips (e.g., 3-nanometer monsters), these components are built using older process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Defining Trailing Edge Nodes

The specific definition of a trailing edge node can vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. TSMC, for instance, classifies any node at 16 nanometers or older as trailing edge, which accounted for approximately 50% of its 2021 revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. These nodes can be further subdivided:
*   **Mature Nodes** – Generally considered to be in the 40 to 450 nanometer range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Legacy Nodes** – Anything older than the mature node range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Most microcontrollers, for example, are manufactured with a 110 or 180 nanometer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## The Chip Shortage

The current chip shortage significantly impacts the trailing edge segment, with many related systems being out of stock until 2023 or beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Causes of the Shortage

The [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics | global semiconductor supply chain dynamics]] leading to the shortage are complex:
*   **Pre-Pandemic Tightness** – Trailing edge node capacity was already relatively tight for several years before the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Pandemic-Induced Cuts and Rebound** – In early 2020, pandemic lockdowns caused a sharp decline in economic activity, leading automotive companies and other manufacturers to halt production and cancel orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. STMicroelectronics, for instance, cut production by 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. However, an unexpected economic bounce-back occurred in the summer, leading to a scramble for product and subsequent shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Demand Surge** – Companies first depleted existing inventories, then began over-ordering to replenish stocks and secure future output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Concurrently, the broader semiconductor industry experienced unprecedented demand driven by cloud computing, the 5G transition, and armed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Capacity Limits** – Since 2019, fab utilization rates have consistently exceeded their long-term target of 80%, reaching levels in the mid-90s, indicating that foundries are at their maximum output from existing facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Investment Challenges

Microchip executive chairman Steve Sanghi estimated that an additional $150 billion in investment is needed over five years to meet trailing edge demand growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. However, building out trailing edge capacity grows at about 2% annually, significantly slower than the 25%+ for leading-edge capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Despite hundreds of billions committed to new fabs globally, only 6% is allocated to mature or legacy node capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Trailing edge chipmakers have been hesitant to invest due to:
*   **Price Sensitivity** – Customers expect prices set by foundries with fully depreciated fabs, making wafers for these nodes very cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Low Revenue Contribution** – Despite contributing significant microprocessor volume, trailing edge nodes account for only 10% of total sales revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Fear of Underutilization** – Investing hundreds of millions or billions in a new fab is expected to lead to substantial underutilization and financial underperformance, making companies prefer to manage backlogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Operational and Technological Hurdles

Several factors contribute to the [[challenges_in_semiconductor_forecasting_and_supply_chain | challenges in semiconductor forecasting and supply chain]] for trailing edge nodes:
*   **Aging Equipment** – Many foundries rely on older, niche equipment. Over 200 fabs still utilize 200-millimeter wafers, smaller than the 300-millimeter industry standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. New 200-millimeter equipment is scarce, leading companies to purchase refurbished items, which are now in short supply due to high fab utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Slowing [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Generational Shifts in Semiconductor Manufacturing]]** – The trend of scaling up designs to newer nodes has slowed. Customers must balance benefits against costs, and some chip types, like analog mixed-signal, radio frequency, and MEMS, do not scale well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Demand for these chips is very high, particularly due to conflicts like the Ukrainian war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **The 28-22 Nanometer "Generation Gap"** – The 28-nanometer node is the most advanced still using a planar gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Newer nodes require more complex FinFET gates, rampant multi-patterning, and potentially extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. These complexities lead to less reliable products, lower yields, and higher costs, making 28nm the bottom of the cost curve on a per-100 million gate basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Customers often don't need faster chips if it means these trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Automotive Industry Demand** – Automotive companies, major consumers of trailing edge chips (accounting for 40% of market demand), prioritize reliability and effectiveness over bleeding-edge performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## [[efforts_to_increase_trailing_edge_chip_production_capacity | Efforts to Increase Trailing Edge Chip Production Capacity]]

As backlogs for older nodes stretch to 18 months or longer, the industry is beginning to address the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Building New Fabs

*   **TSMC** – While building a leading-edge N5 plant in the United States, TSMC is also constructing two new trailing edge fabs in Japan and Kaohsiung, operating on the 28-22 nanometer node range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. TSMC has also announced price increases on older nodes, likely to fund these new fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Samsung** – Traditionally focused on leading-edge technology, Samsung has announced increased investment in trailing edge semiconductor capacity, marking a significant shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **China** – As part of [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | challenges and advancements in Chinese semiconductor industry]], up to a dozen new fabs are under construction across the mainland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. SMIC, the leading Chinese foundry, is investing over $9 billion to add trailing edge wafer capacity in Shanghai and Shenzhen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **India** – Addressing [[challenges_in_indias_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenges in India's semiconductor manufacturing]], the conglomerate Vedanta, in partnership with Foxconn, is building a trailing edge fab in the 65 to 28 nanometer range with substantial government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **United States** – The U.S. CHIPS Act authorizes $2 billion specifically for "mature technology nodes," with the definition to be determined by the Secretary of Commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Improving Existing Fabs

Beyond new construction, the industry can enhance the performance of existing trailing edge fabs:
*   **Wafer Upgrades** – Converting from 200-millimeter to 300-millimeter wafers can more than double the output per wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. While this requires substantial changes to floor layouts and automation systems, it avoids building an entirely new fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **Design-Side Improvements** – Open-source EDA software and Process Design Kits (PDKs) can make hardware development cheaper and easier for designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. An open-source 130-nanometer PDK from Google and SkyWater Technologies, for example, could encourage delayed die shrinks, leading to faster and better chips for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## Outlook

These efforts will take time, with supply constraints for trailing edge chips expected to persist until at least 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. However, signs of progress include slowing revenue growth for trailing edge nodes, new fab construction by major players, China, and India, and a potential slowdown in the macro economy which could dampen overall demand, possibly aligning with new supply capacity hitting the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

National Steel Corporation (NSC), once a source of pride for Philippine industry and a significant employer in Iligan City, ultimately collapsed by 1999 due to a combination of factors, notably problematic privatization processes and the involvement of incompetent foreign investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Early Attempts at Privatization: NASCO and ISMI

The journey toward a national steel industry began post-World War II, with the Philippines possessing abundant metallic minerals like iron, copper, gold, and nickel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. To industrialize, President Carlos Garcia advocated for domestic steel production to reduce reliance on importing finished steel from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

In 1950, the government established the National Shipyard and Steel Corporation (NASCO) in Iligan City as a state-owned enterprise, initially focused on turning scrap metal into various steel products, primarily for shipbuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Foreign Loan Conditions and Partial Privatization

By 1955, NASCO was granted 50 million pesos to develop pig iron plants, aiming to become an integrated steel mill, making it only the second such facility in Asia after Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. However, a currency crisis in the Philippines necessitated foreign loans for equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. In 1958, a $62.4 million loan was secured from the United States Export-Import Bank (Exim Bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This loan came with two crucial conditions:
1.  The funds could only be spent on American steel-making equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
2.  NASCO had to be privatized, with 49% of shares sold to a private investor, though the government could retain a 51% stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

The Exim Bank's insistence on privatization was reportedly due to past bureaucratic inefficiencies in government initiatives, though some accounts suggest American steel companies pushed for it to protect their interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This led to the formation of Iligan Integrated Steel Mills (IISMI) as a joint venture, with Jacinto Steel winning the bid as the private investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. By 1962, the Jacintos had acquired full ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### ISMI's Struggles Under Private Ownership

The privatization process itself caused delays and problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The initial loan proved insufficient to build a full integrated steel mill, only covering a cold and hot rolling mill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. ISMI consistently struggled to turn a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Conflicting views exist regarding its failures: some suggest the Jacinto family diverted ISMI's funds to other ventures, while others contend the government failed to adequately protect the company from domestic competition and did not provide the same level of support seen in other Asian steel industries, like Japan's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Government Re-acquisition and NSC's Golden Age

The economic turmoil of the 1970s, marked by global oil price shocks and peso devaluation, severely impacted indebted industrialists like ISMI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. President Ferdinand Marcos, who did not favor the Jacinto family, saw the Development Bank of the Philippines foreclose on ISMI's loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Following the declaration of martial law in 1972, the military seized ISMI's assets and transferred them to National Steel Corporation (NSC), a subsidiary of the Development Bank, by 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

Under government ownership, NSC thrived. Its primary goals were to stabilize the industry, retain jobs, and save creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. NSC absorbed other bankrupt local steel factories, expanding its capacity significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. By 1979, it was the country's 11th largest corporation, holding a monopoly over the Philippines' steel industry for the next two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. NSC excelled in flat steel products, exporting to China, Indonesia, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

NSC was a major contributor to Iligan City, providing up to 75% of its total revenues in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The company also offered generous benefits, high salaries, and low employee turnover, fostering immense pride among its 4,000 workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Despite challenges like reduced tariffs and cheap imports from Taiwan and [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | South Korea]] in the 1980s, NSC remained profitable and invested in upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Second Privatization and Foreign Ownership: The Beginning of the End

Despite its continued profitability into the 1990s, NSC's flat steel market was declining due to cheaper imports, and the company needed to invest heavily to become fully vertically integrated, particularly in iron and steel making capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The government, with too much exposure to state-owned corporations, lacked the funds for these necessary investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. President Fidel Ramos publicly stated that the government was not meant to run a steel company, leading to the decision to seek a private investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

### Wintek Holdings (Malaysia)

In 1993, the government auctioned off a majority share in NSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. The winner was Malaysian company Wintek Holdings, with the transaction finalized in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. This marked the beginning of NSC's rapid decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

The key issue was that Wintek Holdings, despite being from the steel industry, were primarily foreign steel *traders*, not steel *makers* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Top management had little understanding of steel production, and the Philippine government, which retained a 12.5% share, failed to recognize this fundamental flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

Wintek's management exhibited immediate incompetence and mismanagement:
*   The CEO did not relocate to the Philippines, incurring high commuting costs to Kuala Lumpur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   They ceased holding planning and update meetings, eroding employee trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   Suppliers were switched to their own trading corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   A massive quantity of raw steel goods was ordered at peak prices in late 1995, causing significant financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   Financial disclosures to banks were clamped down, creating opportunities for fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

Losses skyrocketed. NSC laid off employees for the first time since 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. In 1996, a year of strong economic growth in the Philippines, NSC recorded an unprecedented loss of 2 billion pesos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### Haotic Investment Limited (Malaysia)

Early in 1997, Wintek sold NSC to another Malaysian trading firm, Haotic Investment Limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Haotic was highly leveraged, having borrowed approximately $800 million USD to complete the acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. The onset of the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 proved disastrous for their plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

Haotic introduced another Malaysian management team that was equally inexperienced in steel making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Planned upgrades never materialized, and existing infrastructure suffered from a lack of maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The crisis led to another massive devaluation of the peso, making NSC's U.S. dollar-denominated loans and raw materials prohibitively expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Creditors and suppliers severed ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Despite an attempted intervention by Iligan City, NSC ceased operations in November 1999, resulting in 1,800 job losses and a significant drop in city revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

## Failed Revival Attempt: Global Steel Philippines Inc. (India)

In 2004, an Indian group, Global Steel Philippines Inc. (GSPI), connected to ArcelorMittal (then Mittal Steel), the second-largest steel company globally, purchased NSC's mothballed assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. While GSPI's management did possess legitimate experience as steel makers, the company ultimately failed to take off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. It produced some flat steel but operated far below capacity due to a chronic lack of funds, an inability to secure additional government support, and an adversarial relationship with the local community and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This led to another closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[rise_and_fall_of_national_steel_corporation_in_the_philippines | rise and fall of National Steel Corporation in the Philippines]] serves as a cautionary tale regarding the complex interplay of privatization, foreign investment, and economic shocks. While cheap imports played a role in challenging NSC's original markets, the company remained profitable until its privatization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Ultimately, it was the transfer of NSC to incompetent foreign management teams that proved fatal, exacerbating existing challenges and leaving the company vulnerable to the unprecedented financial crisis of 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Despite occasional proposals for revival, the 145-hectare plant now stands as a stark reminder of what could have been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

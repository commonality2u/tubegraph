[[ASML and highvolume EUV systems | Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography]] has become a commercial reality after more than 20 years of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Multi-million dollar machines from [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] utilize EUV light to create extremely small patterns on wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The EUV light source is a critical component, driving [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]]'s $150 million lithography machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This light is generated by lasers firing pulses at tin droplets to produce powerful 13.5 nanometer wavelength light for microprocessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

This article primarily focuses on the EUV approach developed by Kymer, an [[ASMLs partnerships and collaborations | ASML]] subsidiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Another company, Gigaphoton (a Komatsu subsidiary), is also working on reliably generating UV light using its own methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## The Push for Shorter Wavelengths

For a significant period, the semiconductor industry relied on 193 nanometer wavelength light for etching chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Engineers extended its lifespan through techniques like:
*   **Immersion lithography**: Shooting light through ultra-pure water to achieve sharper focus and smaller features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Double patterning**: Using additional exposures to enhance feature density, effectively making a "double pass" through the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Despite these advancements, the industry eventually needed to transition from 193 nanometer technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. EUV light, with its 13.5 nanometer wavelength, emerged as the next crucial step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Key Requirements for EUV Light Sources

Scientists and engineers identified two primary requirements for the next-generation EUV light source:

### 1. High Conversion Efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
The source needed to:
*   Generate sufficient EUV light at the precise 13.5 nanometer wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   Emit light in the correct direction â€“ backwards towards the light collector optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Operate with relative energy efficiency, avoiding excessive power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### 2. Debris Mitigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
Firing lasers at targets creates significant debris, which can contaminate and degrade the performance of the critical optic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Mitigating this debris was essential to meet cost of ownership requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. These two seemingly simple requirements proved incredibly difficult to overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Early Experiments and Challenges

The story of the EUV laser began in 1986, with Japanese researcher Hiro Kinoshita experimenting with x-ray wavelengths to etch transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Early work achieved 500 nanometer half-pitch patterns, followed by Bell Labs with a 50 nanometer half-pitch print in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

These initial experiments used synchrotron radiation, a type of particle accelerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. However, synchrotrons were not practical for industrial use because they emitted UV light over too broad a field of view, meaning insufficient light would enter the collector mirror, failing the first major requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Shifting Goalposts and Optics Challenges
Initially, EUV was planned for the 100 nanometer node, meaning less stringent requirements for light source power and print resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. However, as delays mounted, it was rescheduled for the 70 nanometer, then 50 nanometer nodes, demanding increasingly powerful light sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

This escalating demand impacted the entire design, particularly the EUV optics system meticulously crafted by German optics maker Carl Zeiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. To increase print resolution, Zeiss had to add more mirrors to the projection and illumination systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Each mirror, even perfectly made, reflects at most only 70% of the EUV light, absorbing the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This meant [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] required a much stronger, more brilliant point of plasma light, capable of at least 250 watts, to be competitive with existing 193 nanometer laser technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Laser Produced Plasma (LPP) Development

Researchers extensively experimented with Laser Produced Plasma (LPP), where a laser strikes a target to create plasma that emits UV light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The main concern was always debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

Different target materials were tested, including lithium, tin, and xenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Xenon**: Initially promising, especially rare xenon gas in gaseous or ice form with YAG lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Experiments suppressed xenon ice particles from reaching optics using a gas jet, but the xenon ice plasma emitted high-energy ions that still degraded the optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Tin**: Tin plasma emits significant UV light at the required wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. However, early attempts with tin plates showed terrible conversion efficiency and generated substantial tin debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Even a 1.2 nanometer thick tin layer can cause a 20% decline in collector efficiency and a 10% decline in total tool output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

Despite these issues, various companies began experimenting with firing lasers at tin droplets instead of plates, yielding good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### The Shift to Tin Plasma

In 2002, leading minds in the semiconductor industry convened in Dallas to discuss the future of EUV light sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. They concluded that the xenon laser option had a fundamental roadblock: its conversion efficiency was too low (less than 1%) and could not generate more than several tens of watts of EUV light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:09:02]</a>.

While the tin option presented a "debris nightmare" on the development roadmap, it was believed that engineering could overcome this, as there was "no fundamental physics issue ahead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Thus, the industry made a pivotal decision to pursue tin plasma as the target material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## Innovations in Tin Plasma Generation

### Enhancing Conversion Efficiency
The initial tin plate target had a very low spectral efficiency (around 1%) because the plasma generated was too opaque, blocking 13.5 nanometer light from reaching the mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. To address this, a new, more concave target shape was proposed to increase spectral efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### The Two-Shot Laser Approach
To achieve the desired concave shape with minimal debris, engineers developed a "two-shot" laser system hitting a falling tin droplet twice, 100,000 times a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
1.  **Pre-pulse**: A low-energy laser pulse hits the tin droplet, creating strong pressure waves that reshape it from a sphere into a concave sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Precise aiming is crucial to prevent tilting and damage to the main laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
2.  **Main pulse**: An amplified carbon dioxide (CO2) laser, operating at 10 micrometers wavelength, delivers a powerful blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This vaporizes the droplet, remaking it into an acorn shape and creating dense plasma that emits the 13.5 nanometer EUV light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This plasma is hotter and denser than lightning-created plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

The introduction of the pre-pulse in 2016, combined with more powerful CO2 lasers, allowed [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] and Kymer to drastically increase EUV light source power levels from 10 watts to over 200 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Debris Mitigation with Hydrogen Gas
To protect the collector optics from tin debris particles, high-energy ions, and neutrals from the plasma, Zeiss and [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]] decided to pump hydrogen gas into the vacuum chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This hydrogen buffer gas cools the plasma, blocks a percentage of tin ions, and etches layers of tin from the mirror surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This system ensures the collector mirror can survive over 100 billion pulses or 30,000 hours of operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

## The EUV Machine: Key Components

The EUV machine's core components include:
*   **High-powered CO2 laser**: Comprising a master oscillator and a power amplifier (MOPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This large component often requires installation beneath the clean room floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Beam transport system**: Manages laser focusing and positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Vacuum vessel**: Filled with low-pressure hydrogen gas, it houses the droplet generator, metrology modules, and the EUV collector mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The collector mirror has a hole for the laser to fire through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
*   **Droplet generator**: Shoots 30 micrometer wide tin droplets into the vessel at 50,000 cycles per second (50 kilohertz) and a speed of 80 meters per second (288 km/h) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. This high speed creates sufficient separation between droplets to prevent plasma interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

## Commercial Success and Future Outlook

This intricate setup yields a final conversion efficiency of 6%, a significant improvement from the less than 1% seen in earlier YAG laser experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This breakthrough allowed [[ASMLs role in semiconductor manufacturing | ASML]]'s EUV machines to achieve the stable 250-watt power level necessary for its clients to operate at 125 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. There is even a pathway toward 450 watts in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### Empirical vs. Theoretical Approaches

The [[Challenges in developing commercial EUV systems | development and history of ASML lithography technology | development of EUV]] stands in contrast to earlier lithography advancements, like 193 nanometer argon fluoride lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. The earlier technologies could largely be developed through empirical trial-and-error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

However, with [[Development of UV and EUV lithography technology | EUV]], such an approach is impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Overcoming the thorny energy efficiency and debris mitigation issues, while meeting commercial needs, required a deep understanding of physics and fundamental dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. Researchers first calculated precise parameters like opacity, temperature, droplet size, ion density, and emission duration years in advance, and then built a machine to achieve these specifications in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This systematic, knowledge-driven approach represents a "modern day moon landing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

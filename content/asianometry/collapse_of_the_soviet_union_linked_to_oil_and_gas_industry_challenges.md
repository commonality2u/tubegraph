From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

In 1979, the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union]] was the world's leading producer of oil, pumping 11.5 million barrels daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The country finished the 1960s as the second-biggest oil-producing nation, with its most plentiful oil and natural gas bounties still untapped beneath Siberia's frozen swamps and lakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union]]'s journey to becoming an [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | energy superpower]] ultimately contributed to its eventual dissolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The West Siberian Basin

Located approximately 600 miles east of the Ural Mountains, the Soviet [[development_of_oil_and_gas_infrastructure_in_west_siberia | West Siberian Basin]] is a vast, flat area covering 3.4 million square kilometers, nearly five times the size of Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. About a third of this area, almost one million square kilometers, is potentially oil-bearing, exceeding the combined size of Texas and Oklahoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The region is undeveloped, harsh, and remote, characterized by short summers, long and severe winters with temperatures plunging to -27 degrees Celsius, and common frost and fog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Swamps and lakes cover 60 to 70 percent of the area, and these lakes freeze solid for 9 or 10 months a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Consequently, the area is sparsely populated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Despite the challenging conditions, these lands hold some of the world's largest oil and gas deposits, second only to those in the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. These deposits, dating back to the Triassic and Jurassic periods, include the massive Uren gas field and Russia's largest oil field, Samotlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Shifting Focus to West Siberia

From 1960 to 1970, the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union]]'s total oil production increased from under 3 million barrels per day to 7.1 million barrels, roughly 380 million metric tons per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Much of this new oil came from the "Second Baku" area of the Volga-Ural province in the European regions of the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

As early as the 1930s, Soviet geologists predicted that the [[development_of_oil_and_gas_infrastructure_in_west_siberia | West Siberian Basin]] contained significant deposits potentially larger than those in the Volga-Ural region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. However, the Soviet government initially hesitated to explore and develop these fields due to uncertainties about the volume and extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. A high-ranking Communist Party member even dismissed the claims as "the fruit of a sick provincial imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Declining Older Fields Prompt Action
Circumstances eventually forced the Soviets to change their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Starting in the mid-to-late 1960s, the Volga-Ural oil field declined much faster than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. From 1971 to 1975, the decline was 261 million tons, significantly more than the planned 150 million tons per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

This decline was critical because the oil production business served two vital functions for the Soviets:
*   It was the country's largest source of foreign currency, over 50%, used for purchasing wheat and other goods from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   The Soviets had long-term oil export obligations to Eastern Bloc countries, all of whom, except Romania, depended on Soviet energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. These deliveries were made through extensive cross-country pipelines like "Druzba" (Friendship) and "Bratsville" (Brotherhood) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

In January 1968, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin visited the Tyumen region of [[development_of_oil_and_gas_infrastructure_in_west_siberia | West Siberia]], emphasizing its economic potential and the need for infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. By 1971, Brezhnev began urgently pushing the Soviet economy towards developing [[development_of_oil_and_gas_infrastructure_in_west_siberia | West Siberia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. A new ministry, led by Boris Shcherbina (who later managed the Chernobyl crisis), was founded to build oil infrastructure there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Challenges and Incentives for Development

[[development_of_oil_and_gas_infrastructure_in_west_siberia | West Siberia]] presented a significant development challenge due to its sparse population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Unlike Baku or the Volga-Ural regions, which had existing urban areas or experienced population surges, developing [[development_of_oil_and_gas_infrastructure_in_west_siberia | West Siberia]] meant creating entire towns from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Hundreds of thousands of geologists, builders, and work crews were needed to tap its oil and gas bounty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Worker settlements were difficult to build due to harsh conditions, and with agriculture impossible, all food had to be transported by rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The cost of living in [[development_of_oil_and_gas_infrastructure_in_west_siberia | West Siberia]] was 1.5 to 1.7 times greater than in European parts of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Since the days of Stalin's forced relocations were over, workers had freedom of choice, requiring incentives to move to this "wasteland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Salaries in [[development_of_oil_and_gas_infrastructure_in_west_siberia | West Siberia]] were 2.2 to 2.5 times higher than elsewhere, and promotions were easier to obtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The party ran media campaigns in older oil and gas regions to recruit specialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The majority of these workers were young, under 35, seeking to earn significant money over a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Rapid Growth and Environmental Costs

[[development_of_oil_and_gas_infrastructure_in_west_siberia | West Siberia]] quickly began yielding its vast riches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **1965**: 5.6 million tons of oil and 1.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
*   **1970**: Oil production reached 31 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>
*   **1975**: Oil production reached 141 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>
*   **1977**: Oil production reached 211 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>

By 1973, 113 oil fields had been discovered, including supergiant oil and gas fields like Samotlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

To transport products to European buyers, the Soviets built long gas pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. In the latter half of the 1970s, they laid 1,400 kilometers of pipeline, moved 130 million cubic meters of soil, and tore up 27.2 million square meters of agricultural land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Ready-made pieces were trucked from factories to speed up construction, resulting in gas pipeline construction rates three to five times faster than in the West, and costs per kilometer a third of Western averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Economically, it was a success, but environmentally, it was a disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The rapid construction came at the cost of ecology, leading to wastewater pollution, torn-up taiga, and hundreds of abandoned drilled wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. The drive to fulfill economic plans often disregarded warnings about sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## International Influence and Obligations

[[development_of_oil_and_gas_infrastructure_in_west_siberia | West Siberia]]'s oil dominance found the right customers at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. International conflicts in the 1950s and 60s demonstrated to Europe that sole reliance on Arab oil was unsustainable, making Soviet oil a compelling diversification option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

Austria was the first Western European country to strike an oil deal with the Soviets in 1968, followed by Italy (1969), West Germany (1970), and France (1972) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. West Germany was a particularly notable achievement, despite domestic controversy over taking Soviet gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. The decision was influenced by the decline of German coal mines and skyrocketing domestic gas demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Political issues like Berlin's division and German reunification were concerns, but the German Ministry of Economics believed it would be fine if Soviet share remained under 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. The year after West Germany began accepting Soviet gas, the Four Power Agreement of 1971 was signed, leading to de facto recognition between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

These agreements spurred further economic partnerships throughout the 1970s as part of détente, with the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union]] reaching out to various Western countries, including the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. In 1972, a potential "North Star" energy deal was agreed upon, where Soviet natural gas would be liquefied and shipped to the American West Coast from 1980 to 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This deal, which would have involved Japan, promised much-needed LNG revenues and Western technologies for the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. However, it was eventually nixed by Congress in 1974 due to denials of most-favored-nation status and credit guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

The oil crises of the 1970s, including the Iranian Revolution, further accelerated these economic exchanges between the Soviets and Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Despite the Soviet's reputation as an erratic trade partner, many of these energy relationships persist to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### Economic Dependence of the Eastern Bloc
After World War II, the [[rise of the Soviet Union as an energy superpower | Soviet Union]] established the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) for Eastern Bloc states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Within the CMEA, the Soviets supplied raw goods to its satellites, which in turn sent back manufactured goods, machinery, and agricultural produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Oil deliveries were made on "brotherly terms," significantly below Western market prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The [[rise and decline of Soviet economic strategies | Soviet Union]] could not pass on increased extraction costs to these satellite states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

By the mid-1960s, these inter-bloc trade agreements were known to be unfavorable to the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. As the Soviets developed their lucrative Western European energy export industry in the 1970s, the opportunity costs of these "friendship" oil trade agreements became increasingly clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Despite the unfavorable terms, states like East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary had grown dependent on these "brotherly" oil imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Failing to meet these oil obligations would have had severe political and socio-economic repercussions, especially as the satellites became increasingly indebted to Western creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

## Stagnation and Decline of Soviet Oil Production

While people and policymakers expected the [[development_of_oil_and_gas_infrastructure_in_west_siberia | West Siberian]] energy giant to grow indefinitely, production stalled and gave out almost as fast as it grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Starting in 1975, [[development_of_oil_and_gas_infrastructure_in_west_siberia | West Siberia]]'s oil production growth rates rapidly declined, from 23.8% in 1976 to 7% in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

This abrupt stagnation had massive ripple effects throughout the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. In the 1960s, Soviet oil production increased by about 9.1% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Between 1971 and 1978, this average rate fell to 6.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. By 1981, the country's total oil growth rate fell to under one percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Without access to more advanced oil drills and pumps from the West, Brezhnev and the Soviets felt compelled to simply drill more exploratory wells in search of new fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. The country doubled its annual drilling from 13 million meters in 1977 to over 26 million in 1984, with 16 million of that new drilling occurring in [[development_of_oil_and_gas_infrastructure_in_west_siberia | West Siberia]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This meant exploratory teams had to travel further, drill deeper, and work in more complicated formations, doubling drill costs per meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Despite these efforts, conditions continued to deteriorate, and in 1984, Soviet oil output fell into negative growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

This meant the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet energy industry]], and eventually the [[rise_and_decline_of_soviet_economic_strategies | Soviet economy]] as a whole, found itself investing more to produce less, a seemingly inescapable cycle of "throwing good money after bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

### Economic Strain and Inflexible Consumption
The Soviet empire demanded more oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. In 1970, the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union]] required the energy equivalent of 0.71 tons of coal to generate a thousand dollars of economic income; by 1987, that ratio had risen to 0.83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The [[rise_and_decline_of_soviet_economic_strategies | Soviet economy]], like many developed economies, had become more energy-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

There were no easy answers for cutting consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. In the West, a significant share of oil consumption comes from car drivers and households, who can adjust their usage during oil shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. In the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union]], only 15% of oil consumption came from households, with nearly half from heavy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. These industrial users were not flexible, though a push to switch from oil to natural gas did yield some savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Given its considerable oil export obligations, the Soviets had little room to cut consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

## The 1986 Oil Price Collapse and Dissolution

By the late 1980s, the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union]] was still the world's largest oil producer and third-biggest coal producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Yet, despite this, the country's [[soviet_economic_stagnation_and_need_for_reform | economy had stagnated]], consumed by its unproductive energy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Coherence within the Eastern Bloc faded as the Soviets prioritized their own needs over their socialist allies, leading satellite states to turn to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

Then, in 1986, oil prices collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Rising output from Alaska, the British North Sea, and OPEC contributed to an oil glut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Saudi Arabia specifically raised oil quotas in September 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Oil prices plummeted from $27 a barrel to below $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

This meant all the investment the Soviets had poured into oil suddenly started turning a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Foreign currency earnings from oil and gas sales evaporated, paving the way for the [[hyperinflation_and_economic_crisis_in_soviet_russia | debt crisis]] that dissolved the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union]] a few years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

The Soviets might have been better off in the long run had they never exploited the oil and gas of [[development_of_oil_and_gas_infrastructure_in_west_siberia | West Siberia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. High energy revenues "papered over" the need for [[soviet_economic_stagnation_and_need_for_reform | much needed reforms]] in the [[rise_and_decline_of_soviet_economic_strategies | Soviet economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. There was "no need to improve domestic agriculture if oil money paid for meat and butter from the West," and "no need to make your own computer if you can just buy them from the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

Energy both sustained and ultimately undermined the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. It was the "pillar that kept the Soviet house standing for far longer than it should have" and the "crutch that weakened the country's ability to stand up on its own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. The [[postwar_soviet_oil_expansion_and_political_influence | legacy of the Soviet energy superpower]] and its influence on European and Asian politics continues to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

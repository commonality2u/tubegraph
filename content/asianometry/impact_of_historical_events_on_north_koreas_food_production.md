From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

For a long time, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), or North Korea, has pursued self-sufficiency in food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Achieving this is a significant challenge for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Reliable information about the nation's food situation is difficult to obtain, as official government channels are not considered credible, leading to reliance on anecdotes or rumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Historical Context and Geography

Historically, the northern part of Korea was its industrial heartland, while the south served as its breadbasket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This specialization is reflected in North Korea's geography, with 80% of its land composed of mountains and uplands, and only about 15% of the country's land being arable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Most farms are situated on the west coast, where conditions are more favorable for growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

The cropping season is generally short, with harsh winters, and short, hot, humid, and rainy summers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. A significant portion of the DPRK's rain (60%) falls between June and September, making the country vulnerable to droughts and floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. These extreme climate events are exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure and deforestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Post-War Economic Structure

Upon its founding, the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) inherited an advanced industrialized society from the Japanese occupation government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Even after World War II damage, North Korea held 72% of the peninsula's industrial capacity and over 90% of its hydroelectric capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Much of this was seized by the WPK regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

Land belonging to Korean landlords and Japanese colonialists was also seized and redistributed to the peasantry throughout 1945 and 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. While this could have unlocked agricultural capacity, the Korean War (1950-1953) intervened, ravaging the peninsula, causing immense population upheaval, and annihilating industrial infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

After the war, the DPRK sought aid and guidance from China and the Soviet Union for rebuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Leveraging the deteriorating Sino-Soviet relations, North Korea extracted maximum concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

Domestically, the DPRK adopted an orthodox centrally planned economy, suppressing markets, with the state owning all businesses and providing all jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The state seized all land and established two types of farms: cooperatives and state farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Farmers were restricted to working on these collective farms, with the state owning and confiscating all food grown for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### [[north_koreas_agricultural_selfsufficiency_efforts|Collectivization Efforts]] and Early Challenges
Eternal Leader Kim Il-sung pushed for this [[impact_of_collectivization_on_soviet_agriculture|collectivization]] to achieve self-reliance in food production, aligning with the country's official state ideology of Juche (self-reliance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This approach also increased North Korea's distance from the Soviet Union, which advocated for a very tight economic relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

The [[impact_of_collectivization_on_soviet_agriculture|collectivization]] drive, criticized even by its communist bloc peers, led to food shortages in the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. In response, the North Korean government heavily promoted the use of fertilizers, pesticides, tractors, and irrigation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. While yields stabilized, this made the agricultural sector dangerously dependent on raw inputs like oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Decline of Support and Famine (1990s)

Over the years, North Korea accumulated vast debts to its main benefactors, the Soviet Union and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. These unpaid debts led to the Soviets withdrawing various subsidies in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

That same year, the DPRK instituted a range of [[north_korean_economic_and_agricultural_reforms|new agricultural reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. They intensified double cropping and fertilizer use to expand arable land, raised forests, reclaimed tidal land, and cleared hillsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This was an attempt to compensate for the loss of Soviet aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. However, such intense practices led to soil depletion and acidification, and the newly cleared land was often marginal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Food production still fell short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

The collapse of the Soviet Union caused North Korea to lose its main source of coal, oil, and steel, as the Soviets had provided up to two-thirds of their two-way trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The loss of oil significantly hampered their ability to produce fertilizers and run irrigation infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

The DPRK then turned to China for compensation; by 1993, China supplied 77% of North Korea's fuel and 68% of its food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. However, in 1994, China began experiencing its own grain issues and reduced trade with North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### The Great Famine
In 1994, North Korean radio broadcasts began admitting the existence of hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. While the exact start of the famine is unknown, studies of mortality rates imply that certain provinces were experiencing famine conditions by 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

*   **1993**: Rations were delayed or suspended in some provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **1994**: The government ended food shipments to four provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **1995**: Coercive seizures of grain from farms began, and prison camps were established for those caught foraging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Refugees from hard-hit provinces flowed into China, leading to horrific media reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

Compounding the crisis, the country's four western provinces, where most farms are located, experienced severe flooding in 1995 and, to a lesser extent, in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The floods collapsed terraces and silted fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The North Korean government claimed 5 million people were displaced, over 1 million tons of grain lost, and an estimated $15 billion in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. While floods were severe, the government likely exaggerated the damage, as food shortages predated the floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Playing up the damage allowed the government to save face while requesting [[role_of_international_aid_and_markets_in_north_koreas_food_security|aid from South Korea or Japan]] and deflect outside criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

[[role_of_international_aid_and_markets_in_north_koreas_food_security|International food aid]] did help, but not all of it reached those most in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Many charitable organizations eventually withdrew due to disputes and a lack of accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

The famine of the 1990s was severe, though its full extent, death toll (estimates range from 220,000 to 3.5 million), and precise start/end dates remain uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## Post-Famine Developments and Current Challenges

Since the 1990s, the country's agricultural production has improved due to a combination of [[role_of_international_aid_and_markets_in_north_koreas_food_security|international aid]], favorable weather, and [[north_korean_economic_and_agricultural_reforms|economic reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Much of what is known about North Korea's agricultural situation today comes from international aid programs operating in the country since at least 2011, though their information is subject to interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

After the famine, the government allowed households to own and cultivate private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. These small gardens, where potatoes, corn, and vegetables are grown, are well-cared for due to private ownership and have significantly improved the country's food security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

In 2012, the Kim Jong-un government implemented [[north_korean_economic_and_agricultural_reforms|economic policy changes]] to devolve more authority to lower levels, allowing workers on collective farms to make more of their own decisions regarding material and investment planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. While not as extensive as China's agricultural reforms under Deng Xiaoping, it represents a step forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. The extent and impact of these reforms remain unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### [[challenges_in_north_korean_agricultural_practices|Ongoing Agricultural Challenges]]
Despite improvements, North Korean farmers continue to face several [[challenges_in_north_korean_agricultural_practices|crop growing challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>:

*   **Deteriorating Soil Quality**: Intensive plowing, tilling, and heavy use of chemical fertilizers have caused soil acidification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This hinders the soil's ability to absorb air and water and the plants' nutrient uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Double Cropping**: Planting multiple crops in the same area or year has deteriorated the land's capacity over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This practice, combined with a lack of organic matter, results in reddish soil and significantly lower yields compared to the 1980s (e.g., paddy rice yield dropped from 8.0 to 3.9 tons per hectare) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Farmers are reluctant to implement soil-preserving crop rotations, like legumes, due to fear of not meeting government production goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Lack of Technology**: Farmers often lack adequate farming technology like tractors suited for their fields, and even when available, energy or parts shortages prevent their operation and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Deforestation and Land Degradation**: Intensive efforts to expand arable land involve cutting down trees on hillsides for terraces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. During the famine, cultivation was allowed on slopes above 15% where soils are poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Satellite imagery shows 1 million hectares on slopes above 10 degrees cleared for cereals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Without trees to hold soil, big rainstorms cause erosion and siltation, damaging growing capacity and increasing flood dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Floods have been more destructive since the 1980s when deforestation began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Deforestation also impacts energy generation, as 77% of the rural and 28% of the urban population rely on wood for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### Collapse of Distribution Networks
Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen's work highlights that famines occur not only due to crop failures but also due to collapsed food distribution networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. During the DPRK's central planning era, the state collected all harvests and distributed food rations based on occupation and household size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. During the great famine, even when food was available, oil shortages made distribution difficult, leading to the collapse of the rationing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

Ordinary North Koreans resorted to illegal private markets for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. These "black markets," often run by women, were initially targeted by government crackdowns but were later formalized with housing, facilities, and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Today, defector surveys indicate that most ordinary North Koreans obtain food from these markets and private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. While the government has attempted to revitalize the old food ration system, its extent is unclear; rations are likely reserved for political and economic elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

Kim Jong-un has repeatedly emphasized the importance of improving people's lives through increased food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. However, his government has been short on concrete policy solutions, often offering vague proposals like a "seed revolution" or more of the same, like double cropping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. While food distribution has improved and famine is no longer a major threat, the country's farms have suffered real abuse and soil damage over the decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Fundamental changes to the agricultural situation are needed for North Korea to achieve food self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

[[economic_impact_of_siemens_investment_in_north_tyneside | Northeast England]] was once a major [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | heavy industry]] center, but its economy significantly declined when these industries struggled to find a new growth sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This article examines the historical [[economic challenges of early soviet union | economic challenges]] faced by the region, culminating in the failed attempt to establish a [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductor manufacturing]] facility in [[economic_impact_of_siemens_investment_in_north_tyneside | North Tyneside]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Historical Economic Dependence and Decline

[[economic_impact_of_siemens_investment_in_north_tyneside | Northeast England]] is the least populated first-level region within England, with under 2.7 million residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Its residents have the lowest median gross annual earnings in England and, as of 2012, the highest proportion of the population claiming income support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The region has experienced a significant employment gap with the rest of the UK since at least the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. In 1995, the unemployment rate stood at 9.1%, 50% higher than the rest of the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The region's [[economic challenges of early soviet union | economic challenges]] stem from historical conditions and its long-standing dependence on [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | heavy industry]] and rich coal mines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. After World War II, the British government nationalized the coal and steel industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The Ministry of Fuel and Power argued against introducing new male-employing manufacturing industries, aiming to maximize output and employment in these existing [[natural_resource_dependence_and_economic_challenges | resource economies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This policy left [[economic_impact_of_siemens_investment_in_north_tyneside | Northeast England]] dangerously dependent on these two sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Impact of De-industrialization
When de-industrialization began in the 1980s, residents had few alternative industries to turn to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Tensions escalated with the Miners' Strike of 1984-1985, where miners fought not for wages but to prevent mine closures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Upon the strike's defeat, many mines were found to be depleted of cheaply mined coal, and imported coal was more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This resulted in thousands of job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

By the 1990s, [[economic_impact_of_siemens_investment_in_north_tyneside | Northeast England]] was marginalized in the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. There was a perception that London did not adequately care for the region, especially compared to other areas like Scotland, which received substantially more public spending via the Barnett formula and offered more attractive investment packages to multinational companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## The Siemens Semiconductor Fab Project

In this dire economic context, the prospect of a [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductor manufacturing]] facility was highly anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. In 1995, Siemens, a German company founded in 1847, approached the "Invest in Britain" bureau about establishing a wafer fabrication facility (fab) in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

Siemens, having successfully completed a similar fab in Dresden, planned for the UK facility to be an exact copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The project was estimated to cost 1.1 billion British pounds (785 million USD) and directly create 2,000 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. If fully realized, it would have been the UK's largest inward investment to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

Siemens considered multiple locations, including Ireland, Austria, Israel, Singapore, and Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. [[economic_impact_of_siemens_investment_in_north_tyneside | North Tyneside]] checked all the boxes:
*   **Skilled Workforce**: Availability of skilled technicians willing to work shifts, and educated electronics/computing graduates from local universities or nearby Scotland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Lower Salaries**: Salaries were 50% lower than in Austria or Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure**: Excellent water and power infrastructure, with the government offering a direct connection to the national grid â€“ a first for a private company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Geological Stability**: A crucial factor for fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Government Support**: Local development agencies actively courted Siemens officials, offering entertainment, tours, university presentations, and substantial government aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. UK public support totaled 64 million pounds (45 million USD), though not all was used, including tax exemptions, grants, and job training subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

The investment was seen as a significant opportunity to establish [[economic_impact_of_siemens_investment_in_north_tyneside | Northeast England]] as a [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductor]] hub, attracting suppliers and potentially sparking an entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The UK government also hoped to transfer technology and skills to the local population and reduce [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductor]] imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Rapid Construction and Public Enthusiasm
Siemens aimed for rapid construction, breaking ground before even owning the land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. They used an innovative steel frame to accelerate building, completing the fab in just 376 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Production began in May 1997, and Queen Elizabeth II toured the facility, proclaiming that the fab brought the country to the forefront of [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductor manufacturing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## The Collapse of the Siemens Fab

Despite the initial optimism, the [[economic_impact_of_siemens_investment_in_north_tyneside | North Tyneside]] fab was always on thin ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. The DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) market is notoriously volatile, prone to oversupply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. These memory chips are a cheap commodity, with little differentiation, competing primarily on price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. There are many competitors, particularly in Asia, with [[the_impact_of_historical_legacies_on_south_koreas_economy | South Korea]] holding 40% of the market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

Siemens' decision to equip the fab with older 16-megabyte memory technology was perilous, as it was already becoming outdated by 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. The goal was to profit from older modules by producing them in a cheaper location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### Market Crash and Closure
In 1998, the [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductor]] market crashed, especially for memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The price per megabyte plummeted from $27 to just $4 by the time the [[economic_impact_of_siemens_investment_in_north_tyneside | North Tyneside]] plant opened in 1997, and then further to $2 by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Chips that sold for $50 in 1995 were selling for just $1 in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. [[the_impact_of_historical_legacies_on_south_koreas_economy | South Korean]] [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductor]] giants, teetering from the Asian financial crisis, flooded the market to stay afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

Siemens Semiconductor, which had made a profit in 1997, incurred a stunning loss of 1.2 billion Deutsche Mark (722 million USD) by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. To cut costs, the UK plant was chosen for closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. It lacked scale, being only a third of the capacity of the Dresden plants, and had no strong internal or external backers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Pro-British management within Siemens lost their jobs, and the new CEO was pro-Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. The closure, announced in July 1998, came just 15 months after operations began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

## Aftermath and Lingering Challenges

The closure of the [[economic_impact_of_siemens_investment_in_north_tyneside | North Tyneside]] fab cost nearly a quarter of a billion dollars and required Siemens to repay some government grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. In August 1999, Siemens Semiconductor was spun off as Infineon Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

An attempt to revive the facility occurred in September 2000 when Atmel, a [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductor]] firm specializing in higher-value products like flash memory and microcontrollers, acquired the fab for 25 million pounds (35 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Atmel pledged a 700 million pound investment to retool the facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. However, the dot-com crash in 2001 impacted the electronics industry, leading Atmel to lay off 26% of its workforce and interrupt its [[economic_impact_of_siemens_investment_in_north_tyneside | Northeast England]] investment plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. By 2006, Atmel shifted to a "fab-light" model, selling off four fabs, including the [[economic_impact_of_siemens_investment_in_north_tyneside | North Tyneside]] site in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. TSMC bought the equipment, and the empty buildings were sold off, effectively ending the [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductor]] dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

### Broader De-industrialization
The closure of the [[economic_impact_of_siemens_investment_in_north_tyneside | North Tyneside]] fab was not an isolated incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. In 1998 alone, 3,400 manufacturing jobs were lost in [[economic_impact_of_siemens_investment_in_north_tyneside | Northeast England]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Factories belonging to Electrolux and Pringle also closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. The [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | Fujitsu]] fab, which opened in 1989, also eventually closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

The underlying curse of the local economy was its lack of native corporate leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. These manufacturing jobs were provided by foreign companies with little attachment to the region, who favored their homelands during financial crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. Today, the former fab facility is the Cobalt Business Park, hosting government offices, call centers, and regional offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

## Future Prospects

[[economic_impact_of_siemens_investment_in_north_tyneside | Northeast England]] has yet to fully return to its past glory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. However, there are emerging "green shoots" in the [[future_prospects_and_renewable_energy_investments_in_northeast_england | energy sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. [[future_prospects_and_renewable_energy_investments_in_northeast_england | Renewable energy]] companies have begun investing in the region, leading to a growing wind industry, with the Darker Bank wind farm poised to become one of the world's largest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

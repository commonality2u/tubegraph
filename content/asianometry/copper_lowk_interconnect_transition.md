An integrated circuit (IC) can contain a billion transistors, but they are useless if they cannot be connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This is where interconnects come in, acting as wires to transmit electrical signals between transistors and other circuit elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. For over 30 years, these interconnects were made from aluminium, with silicon dioxide as the insulating layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. However, by the late 1990s, new materials became technically necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This video details the semiconductor industry's significant [[aluminium_to_copper_transition_in_interconnects | transition to copper and Low-K interconnects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Metallization
The process of laying down these metal interconnects is called "metallization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. As a "back end of the line" process, metallization occurs after transistors are fabricated on the silicon wafer in the "front end of the line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

During metallization, layers of fine metal wiring, known as "metal layers," are deposited on top of the transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. These metal layers are separated by insulating dielectric material layers, technically termed "intermetal dielectric layers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Holes, called "vias," are cut into these dielectric layers to connect multiple metal layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Modern integrated circuits are complex, multi-layered structures, akin to a densely built city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## RC Delay
A critical challenge in interconnect design is RC delay, which stands for resistance-capacitance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Resistance (R)**: All wires have resistance, which impedes electron flow, degrading signals and losing energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Resistance depends on material and is proportional to length; thus, thicker, shorter, and wider wires have less resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Capacitance (C)**: This refers to objects' ability to store charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Due to the close proximity of wires and the insulating dielectric layers between them, the setup mimics a capacitor, storing unwanted charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This higher capacitance slows down signal transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

RC delay is the extra time an electrical signal takes to travel through an interconnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. A longer RC delay means signals propagate slower across the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Types of Interconnects
A single microchip incorporates several types of interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### [[local_and_global_interconnects_in_microchips | Local Interconnects]]
The lowest layers of metal wires, placed directly on top of transistors, are called [[local_and_global_interconnects_in_microchips | local interconnects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. They connect local "blocks" of adjacent elements, similar to small neighborhood roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. These are designed to be thinner and closer together because they don't span long distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Being close to the transistor layer, they require high heat resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Common materials for [[local_and_global_interconnects_in_microchips | local interconnects]] include poly-silicon, tungsten, or aluminium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### [[local_and_global_interconnects_in_microchips | Global Interconnects]]
Higher up on the chip are [[local_and_global_interconnects_in_microchips | global interconnect]] layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. These are larger, longer connections that span significant portions of the chip, akin to city avenues or highways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. [[local_and_global_interconnects_in_microchips | Global interconnects]] also deliver critical signals like clock signals for synchronization and power for chip operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. To cover large distances with minimal resistance, they are made as thick as possible and use low-resistivity metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Intermediate layers between [[local_and_global_interconnects_in_microchips | global]] and [[local_and_global_interconnects_in_microchips | local]] layers are known by various names, such as semi-global or intermodule interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Logic versus Memory
Logic chips generally have more metal layers (sometimes 10-15) than memory chips (3-5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This is because memory has a repetitive, dense structure that requires fewer interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Logic chips are more irregular with lower device density but need extensive and precise connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Materials
Initially, silicon dioxide was used for the intermetal dielectric layer, and aluminium for the interconnects, particularly [[local_and_global_interconnects_in_microchips | global]] ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Both materials were chosen for their ease of manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Silicon dioxide could be easily laid down using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Aluminium has the fourth lowest resistance (after silver, copper, and gold) and works well with silicon dioxide in manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. When aluminium is deposited on silicon dioxide, they react to form a protective alumina layer, preventing aluminium atoms from diffusing into the silicon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This process worked effectively for the first 30 years of semiconductor technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Getting Denser
As chips became denser and transistors shrank, more interconnects were needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Designers scaled interconnect systems by shrinking their size (e.g., pitch, the distance between parallel wires) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This increased wire resistance, leading to more RC delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Engineers then made wires relatively taller, but this had limits due to manufacturing difficulties with the step-like structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Denser wire clusters also led to more unwanted capacitance, further increasing RC delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Adding more metal layers also introduced process challenges, increasing the chances of defects and worsening yields, making chips less economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## The Big Problem
Initially, RC delay was less significant than delays from the circuit devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. However, as chips grew more complicated, RC delay became a major contributor to the chip's speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. By the mid-1990s, it was clear that the existing approach was unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. For example, by the 100-nanometer process node, transmitting a signal through a 1-millimeter interconnect would take six times longer than through an equivalent-sized transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## Copper & Low-K
To address the RC delay issue, scientists decided to replace the interconnect system's materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

First, the interconnect metal was changed from aluminium to copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Copper lines offer 35% less resistance than their aluminium counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

Second, unwanted capacitance was reduced by changing the insulating dielectric layer material from silicon dioxide to a "low-K dielectric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This new material needed a dielectric constant (k-value) lower than silicon dioxide's 3.9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The combination of copper and low-K dielectrics could potentially cut RC delay by a factor of four, allowing for fewer metal layers and thinner wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## IBM's Big Announcement
In September 1997, IBM announced it had successfully produced copper interconnects, a culmination of 15 years of secret work on the "red aluminium" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The achievement, featuring six layers of copper interconnects, was a significant milestone in semiconductor history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. IBM intended to mass-produce copper-wired wafers by early 1998, with Apple Computer's Power Macs as the first chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Copper Problems
IBM's announcement was momentous due to the significant manufacturing challenges posed by copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Copper Poisoning**: Copper atoms can quickly diffuse into silicon or silicon dioxide, accumulating and degrading chip performance, a phenomenon known as "copper poisoning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. A "diffusion barrier," typically made from tantalum, is required to prevent this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This barrier must adhere to both copper and low-K insulation layers, resist corrosion, and be easily and evenly deposited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
*   **Inability to Etch**: Unlike aluminium, copper cannot be easily etched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

### Damascene
Because copper cannot be directly etched, IBM reversed the traditional manufacturing sequence, adopting the "damascene" method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
The damascene process involves:
1.  Laying down the intermetal dielectric layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
2.  Using lithography to transfer interconnect patterns (trenches and vias) onto the dielectric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
3.  Etching the pattern into the dielectric layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
4.  Applying a diffusion barrier (e.g., tantalum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
5.  Filling the trenches with copper, typically using electroplating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
6.  Sanding off excess copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
7.  Applying a capping layer to prevent copper diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
This intricate process, named after the ancient metal inlay technique from Damascus, was critical for copper implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

## The Copper Road
IBM's breakthrough was built upon several cumulative technological advancements:
*   **Diffusion Barriers**: Research on tantalum and tantalum nitride as effective diffusion barriers began in the late 1980s and progressed into the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **Damascene Method**: IBM invented the damascene method around 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   **Trench Filling**: The most significant hurdle was filling trenches and vias without defects, as traditional methods like sputtering or CVD left seams or voids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. In 1989, a small IBM group discovered "super-filling" or "bottoms-up growth" using electroplating, which filled the trench from the bottom up like a liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
*   **Multi-Level Copper Wires**: By 1993, an IBM team combined diffusion barriers, damascene, and electroplating to produce multi-level copper wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.
*   **Dual Damascene**: The initial damascene method was not economically viable due to throughput and yield issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. In 1995, an IBM team led by Dan Edelstein re-engineered the process with a "dual damascene" methodology, producing both trenches and vias simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This new recipe met internal requirements, leading to IBM's commitment to high-volume production and the public announcement in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## Bringing it to the Fab
Implementing copper interconnects in high-volume production presented formidable challenges for IBM's chip foundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. Since copper can "poison" silicon and cause defects, tools on the copper lines had to be isolated from the rest of the fab, a complex task in shared-tool environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Additionally, copper dissolves in water and is toxic, necessitating new waste disposal technologies in the fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

## Rumblings
Initially, IBM was seen as 1-3 years ahead of competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. However, just two weeks after IBM's announcement, Motorola also declared it had produced copper interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. Before 1989, IBM was the only company researching copper interconnects, but the entire industry realized aluminium's deficiencies thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. Other companies, including Motorola (starting in 1990 via its PowerPC alliance with IBM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>, AMD (around 1995) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>, and AT&T's Bell Labs (around the same time, developing its stack independently) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>, began their own efforts. Surprisingly, Intel did not start its copper interconnect program until 1997, despite its own researchers having published on copper electroplating in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

### Rapid Catch-up
The number of published articles on copper interconnect technology steadily rose before IBM's announcement, much of it facilitated by Sematech, an R&D consortium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Inspired by IBM's early releases, executives directed public R&D funds to universities, and the findings were released into the public domain, allowing other companies to hire trained graduate students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Thus, despite IBM's secrecy regarding certain details, the rest of the industry rapidly caught up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

## 180 Nanometers
The 180-nanometer node (or 0.18 microns), scheduled for high-volume production in 1999, introduced a series of major technical changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>:
*   **Copper Interconnects**: It featured the introduction of copper interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   **Feature Size Reduction**: Another 30% reduction in feature size, as per Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
*   **New Lithography Tools**: Fabs simultaneously started receiving new 193-nanometer DUV excimer laser lithography tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.
*   **300mm Wafer Delay**: The transition to 300-millimeter wafers, initially planned for this node, was pushed back to the 130-nanometer node due to the multitude of other changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

In 1998, IBM launched the 180-nanometer generation with the PowerPC 750CX, which saw its speed jump from 300 to 400 Megahertz due to copper interconnects, giving IBM a technological lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. Motorola followed, releasing a 220-nanometer "half-node" in late 1998 with PowerPC G4 chips, used in Apple's PowerBook G4 and iBook G4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

The semiconductor manufacturing industry had more players at the time, each adopting their own variants of the 180-nanometer generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. Intel's 180-nanometer process, for instance, did not use copper interconnects because they were late to copper and needed a process that could scale rapidly for massive PC CPU production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. Intel only implemented copper interconnects in November 2000, with the 130-nanometer node, and even then, only six out of seven layers were copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

## TSMC and UMC
Across the Pacific, Taiwan's foundries, TSMC and UMC, started further behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. Until 1997, they had not seriously considered copper but now had to learn quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. TSMC struggled with its 250-nanometer process, allowing UMC to catch up rapidly in market share and capacity by 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.

TSMC CEO Morris Chang initiated a crash effort to develop an in-house copper interconnect implementation, led by a team of six elite scientists, including Dr. Chiang Shang-yi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. UMC, conversely, joined an IBM-sponsored research consortium, benefiting from IBM's patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>. Both approaches yielded results, and by 1999, both UMC and TSMC shipped 180-nanometer chips with the top two metal layers made of copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. While lagging behind IBM's six-layer copper chips, it was a significant step toward full copper integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

## The Low-K Problem
While copper addressed increasing wire resistance, the other half of the interconnect system—a good [[challenges_in_implementing_lowk_dielectrics | Low-K dielectric material]] for cutting down unwanted capacitance—remained a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. The industry lacked a suitable replacement for silicon dioxide that could fit well into the process flow without falling apart or failing reliability metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. Unlike copper, where the challenge was materials engineering, with Low-K, the industry often didn't even know what materials to engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.

### TSMC Spins Around
The semiconductor industry attempted to implement Low-K dielectrics three times:
1.  **250-nanometer node**: They used Fluorinated Silicon Glass (FSG), silicon dioxide doped with fluorine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. FSG had a slightly lower K-value (3.5) than traditional silicon dioxide (3.9) and was applied via CVD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.
2.  **180-nanometer node**: The industry tried Hydrogen Silsesquioxane (HSQ), with a lower K-value of about 2.8, applied using a "spin-on" technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. While HSQ passed internal tests, it failed to scale in high-volume production because the spin-on method, combined with high fab temperatures, stressed the HSQ layer, causing distortion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. TSMC and Texas Instruments faced this problem, leading to delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.

### The Legendary 130
The 130-nanometer node, following a minor 150-nanometer node by TSMC, was expected to complete the copper interconnect transition and introduce a "true" [[challenges_in_implementing_lowk_dielectrics | Low-K dielectric]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.

In April 2000, IBM, UMC, and Infineon announced their adoption of Dow Chemical's proprietary Low-K material, SiLK, with a K-value of 2.6 (potentially 2.2), applied using the spin-on technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>. This was a bold choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. However, others, like Texas Instruments, favored "Black Diamond" from Applied Materials, which had a K-value of 2.8 but was exclusive to CVD, not spin-on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.

The semiconductor industry split on the Low-K dielectric choice: IBM, UMC, and affiliates chose SiLK, while Texas Instruments and TSMC chose Black Diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. TSMC's Dr. Chiang personally vowed never to use the spin-on technique again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. Intel, due to its massive capacity needs, stuck with the older FSG technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

Ultimately, the SiLK + spin-on setup failed to ship products for IBM and UMC's customers, incurring significant financial and strategic costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. On October 2001, TSMC became the first to ship 130-nanometer chips with both copper interconnects and [[challenges_in_implementing_lowk_dielectrics | Low-K dielectric]] (Black Diamond) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. TSMC also offered an alternate FSG dielectric version to ensure customer supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. Yields for products like Nvidia's NV30 started low but reached 70% by late 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>.

UMC signaled defeat in late 2001, abandoning SiLK for a CVD process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. IBM eventually switched to CVD as well, but their initial SiLK decision led to public criticism from customers like Xilinx, highlighting IBM Micro's manufacturing weaknesses despite its technological strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.

## Conclusion
TSMC's successful implementation of the 130-nanometer node, particularly with copper and [[challenges_in_implementing_lowk_dielectrics | Low-K dielectric]], distinguished the Taiwanese giant from its competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. Their R&D team, "the Six R&D Horsemen," received the 2003 Outstanding Scientific and Technological Worker Award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. This achievement transformed TSMC's image from a mere factory meeting excess demand to a recognized innovator and a force to be reckoned with in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>.

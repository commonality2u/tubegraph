The [[rise_and_decline_of_soviet_economic_strategies|Soviet economy]] experienced significant growth for generations, outpacing most other developing countries except Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. However, it later faced [[soviet_economic_stagnation_and_need_for_reform|stagnation]] as its initial growth strategies ran their course and it failed to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Early Industrialization and the Command Economy

Prior to the Soviet Union, the Russian Empire in 1913 was the world's largest country by area and third in population, but its populace was largely poor and agricultural, with incomes on par with Japan and Latin America, far behind the rest of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. World War I devastated the Russian Empire, causing national income to fall by 80% and inflation to rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

After the Bolshevik takeover in 1917, the government initially attempted to establish a command economy by confiscating food, nationalizing industry, and seizing estates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This effort was interrupted by a brutal five-year Civil War (1918-1923), which further annihilated infrastructure, transportation, and industry, leading to incomes falling to pre-modern levels ($600 in today's dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

In 1921, Lenin introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP), backing off the command economy in favor of policies like a progressive tax on agricultural surplus, which spurred recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

By 1928, Stalin discarded the NEP and, with the first Five-Year Plan, re-established the command economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. The Soviet economy at this time was characterized by a shortage of capital (infrastructure, factories) and a surplus of labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. Stalin's core strategy for growth was heavy capital investment in "producer goods" such as machinery, factories, power stations, and railways, creating a feedback loop where these goods produced more steel, electricity, and machinery, which were then reinvested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

A significant driver for the command economy and its heavy industry focus was the Soviet Union's heavily militarized nature due to foreign hostility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. This "permanent war economy" prioritized military heavy industry like tanks, guns, and explosives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. This focus also led to state secrecy in economic central planning, preventing open discussion and siphoning resources from other economic sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

Stalin's drive increased the investment rate from 8% in 1928 to 20% in the mid-1930s, making massive government investment a cornerstone of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. While some investments were genuinely helpful, there was also much wasteful and unproductive infrastructure built, like building the world's biggest dams while people went hungry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

Collectivization, the replacement of individual peasant farms with collective ones, occurred during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. Although it led to famines and the deaths of millions, it did spur migration from the countryside to cities, fueling the industrial sector's labor needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. Gross national product (GNP) rose by over 5% annually from 1928 to 1970, largely attributed to capital accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

## Shifting Priorities and Emerging Technological Lag

By the 1960s, the Soviet government, recognizing its powerful heavy industry, sought to reorient the economy towards consumer goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. Nikita Khrushchev declared in 1956:
> Now that we possess a powerful heavy industry developed in every respect, we are in the position to promote rapidly the production of both the means of production and consumer goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>

This shift was prompted by the sputtering of the traditional engines of [[rise_and_decline_of_soviet_economic_strategies|Soviet economic strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>:
*   **Exhaustion of Labor Surplus**: The initial growth was fueled by moving unemployed agricultural workers and women into the industrial workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. By the 1950s, this agricultural unemployment ended, and nearly all women (51% of the workforce by 1973) were already in the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. The old heavy industry growth model stopped working as this labor source was depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.
*   **Agricultural Underperformance**: Farms suffered from under-investment and poor management, leading to lower yields compared to other European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. Despite efforts to mechanize and modernize, and the Soviet Union's vast size, it had relatively little farmable land compared to countries like the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. Attempts to create new fertile land, such as draining the Aral Sea for cotton, proved to be wasteful and environmentally disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
*   **Outdated Industrial Equipment**: [[challenges_in_soviet_computer_production|Soviet industrial factories]] struggled with outdated equipment. While adept at installing new capital equipment, they were not good at retiring and replacing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. In 1970, 28% of equipment was over 10 years old, rising to 34% by 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. Plant managers often avoided work stoppages for fear of missing production quotas, opting to refurbish existing equipment, a "disastrous waste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

## Technological Lag

A critical reason for the failure to upgrade equipment was the lack of available technologically advanced alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. While the [[soviet_computer_development_history|Soviet Union]] employed "fantastic minds" and pioneered incredible sciences and technologies (e.g., in computer chips, landing on Venus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>, these advancements primarily occurred within the military and government sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. This meant they remained state secrets and did not spill over into the civilian sector for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.

Unlike the American military-industrial complex, which saw technological spillover effects like GPS and the internet benefiting private entities, the Soviet economy, centered on military capacity, prevented this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. As foreign tensions rose in the 1980s, the military's grip on the economy only tightened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. This created a massive [[soviet_versus_western_computing_capabilities|technological gap]] between the US and USSR's civilian sectors despite the USSR's scientific capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. Soviet urbanites seeking quality goods resorted to importing them from the West, necessitating hard currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.

With agricultural, industrial, and consumption sectors struggling, the government turned to natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. The Soviet Union was rich in oil, gas, iron ore, and coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. By the 1970s, ore mines were aging, and the government invested heavily to extract more from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. The 1973 oil embargo by OAPEC dramatically increased oil prices, benefiting the Soviet Union as a major oil supplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. Soviet exports to the West grew 26% from 1970 to 1980, largely due to oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

However, these oil fields were also losing productivity. From 1975 to 1985, oil investment costs surged from 28% to 39% of the total Soviet investment budget, and employment rose by 25%, yet actual oil output fell by 21% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. The economy became trapped in a resource dependency, using hard currency from oil sales to fund imports of food and consumer goods, a non-sustainable model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>. The collapse of oil prices in the 1980s due to an oil glut ultimately spelled the beginning of the end for the [[soviet_economic_stagnation_and_need_for_reform|Soviet economy]], as it lacked sufficient foreign currency income to sustain operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>.

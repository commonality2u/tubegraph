Patents have played a significant role in shaping the development and global adoption of [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.

## Early Discoveries and Challenges

The fundamental structure of the lithium-ion battery, with its focus on cathodes, was discovered and patented by American scientist Dr. John Goodenough, a Nobel laureate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. Dr. Goodenough also pioneered the LFP cathode itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.

However, the LFP chemistry as initially invented by Goodenough was not commercially performant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. A key issue was poor electrical conductivity, meaning charge carriers could not move efficiently between the cathode and anode during charging and discharging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

## Key Innovations and Patent Consolidation

Years later, crucial innovations, including carbon coating and advanced process technologies, were developed that made LFP a commercially competitive product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. These advancements were patented by researchers primarily at universities and public entities in Canada and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>.

All these patents were subsequently consolidated under a single Swiss entity responsible for managing global licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

## The "Patent Shield" for China

According to the IEA, a deal was struck in the 2000s or 2010s that granted Chinese battery manufacturers free access to these LFP battery patents, but *only* for their local markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. All other international entities were required to negotiate and pay a license fee to use the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

This unique arrangement, effectively a "patent shield," allowed the Chinese battery industry to heavily invest in and develop expertise in [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | LFP technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. Meanwhile, EV battery makers in the rest of the world often hesitated to pursue LFP structures due to the patent licensing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.

## Patent Expiration and Market Impact

These crucial patents eventually expired in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. This meant that foreign battery makers could finally access and use the LFP chemistry without concerns about licensing fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.

However, by the time of patent expiration, [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | Chinese battery manufacturers]] had already established an immense proficiency in the LFP supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:05]</a>. This included advanced cell-to-pack innovations like BYD's Blade Battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>, massive economies of scale, robust materials sourcing networks, and developed talent pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. Consequently, foreign companies trying to enter the LFP market found themselves at a significant disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>.

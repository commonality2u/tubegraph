Semiconductor manufacturing has seen significant advancements driven by continuous innovation and intense competition among leading companies like TSMC, Samsung, and IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## Key Technological Milestones

### Copper Interconnects
For decades, the semiconductor industry relied on aluminum for interconnects (wires connecting circuit elements on a chip) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. However, copper interconnects offered superior performance with 40% less resistance, 15% faster speed, and the ability to be made much smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. Despite challenges like copper atom diffusion into silicon, IBM first invented, patented, and announced copper interconnect implementation in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

In the early 2000s, IBM offered to license their technology to TSMC, but TSMC's R&D team, while recognizing copper as the future, rejected IBM's offer to develop their own solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. In approximately one year, a team of six TSMC R&D scientists developed their own 130 nanometer process node with copper interconnects, shipping wafers in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. This development was critical, allowing TSMC to surpass IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

### Lithography Advancements
Further advancements in manufacturing technology included the industry transition to 193 nanometer emerging lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. ASML's adoption of immersion lithography allowed them to overtake Japanese lithography makers Canon and Nikon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.

### FinFET Technology
[[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Generational shifts in semiconductor manufacturing]] have been characterized by major architectural changes. The transition to FinFET gate implementations was a monumental undertaking for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>. TSMC named its FinFET node 16 nanometers, while Samsung called it 14 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>.

Liang Mong-Song, a specialist in FinFET technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>, played a critical role in bringing this technology to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. After his defection to Samsung, he ended Samsung's plans for a 20 nanometer process, instead pushing them to directly jump from 28 nanometers to 14 nanometers, adopting FinFET simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. This multi-generational leap was incredibly rapid, allowing Samsung to announce a 14 nanometer process node ahead of TSMC's 16 nanometer in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. This move secured significant customers like Qualcomm and Apple for Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>.

### Process Node Evolution
The relentless pursuit of smaller and more efficient process nodes defines [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | semiconductor manufacturing advancements]].
- **130 nanometer:** Developed by TSMC with copper interconnects and shipped in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
- **28 nanometer and 20 nanometer:** These nodes represented the end of planar scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. Samsung rapidly made ground in process node development, achieving 45 nanometer, then 32 nanometer, and finally 28 nanometer nodes in just two years after 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>. SMIC also unveiled their 28 nanometer process node in February 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[21:43:00]</a>, later raising its yield from 60% to over 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>. However, UMC achieved 98% yield rates with their 28 nanometer node, impacting SMIC's business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>.
- **14 nanometer and 12 nanometer:** SMIC, under Liang's guidance, pursued another multi-generational jump to 14 and 12 nanometers, achieving a 95% yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:14:00">[22:14:00]</a>.
- **10 nanometer, 7 nanometer, and 5 nanometer:** After being temporarily overtaken by Samsung, TSMC mobilized a massive R&D effort to retake node leadership at these advanced process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>. The 7 nanometer node is noted as the last possible node achievable with older DUV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:46:00">[22:46:00]</a>. As of the video's writing, TSMC remains the leading semiconductor foundry with Samsung in second place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>.

## Beyond Leading Edge (More Than More)

TSMC initiated a "Beyond More" or "More Than More" initiative to expand its [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | trailing edge foundry capabilities]] into new verticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. This includes areas such as MEMS, automotive sensors, and chiplet-style advanced packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. Today, this is a growing business for TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.

## The Human Element in Innovation
The story of Liang Mong-Song, a "semiconductor renegade," highlights that beyond advanced machinery like EUV machines, the people and their dedication are what truly drive the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:27:00">[24:27:00]</a>. TSMC, for instance, is characterized by "brilliant, maniacally driven people" who make the impossible mundane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:39:00">[23:39:00]</a>. Their ability to navigate technically challenging decisions has allowed companies to "leapfrog rivals" repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. This drive has significantly contributed to [[recent_trends_and_future_directions_in_semiconductor_materials | recent trends and future directions in semiconductor materials]] and process innovation.

## Challenges for Chinese Semiconductor Industry
[[developments_in_chinas_domestic_semiconductor_ecosystem | Developments in China's domestic semiconductor ecosystem]] have faced unique [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | challenges and advancements in Chinese semiconductor industry]]. SMIC, a China-based company, appointed a new chairman in 2015 with the goal of bringing SMIC back to the leading edge in direct competition with TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>. However, their efforts to acquire an EUV machine from ASML were blocked by the US government, leading some at SMIC to focus on [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | trailing edge nodes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>. This illustrates the significant [[impact_of_government_policies_and_military_demand_on_semiconductor_innovation | impact of government policies and military demand on semiconductor innovation]] in the global landscape.

The silicon wafer is the fundamental building block for semiconductors, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and solar cells, serving as a substrate for microelectronics devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. Over the past 70 years, extensive research and engineering have gone into creating cutting-edge semiconductor wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Current Wafer Sizes and Production Challenges

Generally, silicon wafers are produced in 150, 200, and 300 millimeter sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. Producing larger wafers is more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. However, if they are manufactured correctly with a good yield, bigger wafers are far more economical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. The current industry standard is 300 millimeters, a size that took ten years of unprecedented industry coordination, on par with the transition to [[economic_impact_and_cost_considerations_of_euv_technology | EUV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>.

## The Push for 450 Millimeter Wafers

The proposed next step is to migrate to 450 millimeter wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.
The idea has been circulating for a while, but the industry is in a deadlock over it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

### Proponents and Their Reasoning
Intel, TSMC, and Samsung are in favor of this transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>. From their perspective, a 450 millimeter wafer has a surface area twice as large as a 300 millimeter wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>. While there are some considerations for photolithography and cleaning with a larger wafer, the processing equipment would only cost about 30 percent more, presenting a definite advantage for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>.

### Opponents and Their Reasoning
Equipment and wafer suppliers, such as Shin-Etsu Chemical, Lam Research, and Applied Materials, are not in favor of the transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>. Their reasons include:
*   Slower throughputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>
*   Increased spending on silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>
*   Lower yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>
*   The need to retool brand new equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>
    *   These efforts must be financially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>.

### Timeline and Challenges
While there are no technical boundaries to producing 450mm wafers, substantial economic and engineering challenges exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>. The first 400 millimeter crystals were grown as early as 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>. The original roadmap projected the first 450 millimeter wafers to be available in 2014, but this timeline has continuously been pushed back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.

## The Future of Silicon Wafers

Despite discussions about moving away from silicon for future generations of semiconductors, silicon is expected to remain central to the industry for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. It is a sector valued at over $10 billion and forms the literal foundation of the $400 billion semiconductor world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>.

However, silicon may not be the ultimate answer for all future applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>. As Moore's Law stalled, the industry sought better end-user performance through other methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>. This includes the system-on-chip approach, where different components optimized for specific use cases are integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>. For instance, parts of a chip requiring high power or high voltage, with band gap requirements that silicon cannot fulfill, might be fabricated using materials like gallium nitride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. These gallium nitride parts can then be matched with traditional silicon to deliver enhanced end-user performance without relying on further transistor scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>. Wafer technologies will need to adapt to these new developments, adding further engineering sophistication to their production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.

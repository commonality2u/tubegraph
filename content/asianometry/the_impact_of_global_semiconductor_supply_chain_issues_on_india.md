India is recognized as a [[indias_design_capabilities_in_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor design powerhouse]], with nearly every major semiconductor company maintaining a presence in the country for advanced chip design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Tens of thousands of Indian engineers are directly involved in VLSI design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. However, once these designs are completed, they are sent abroad—to countries like the United States, China, South Korea, or Taiwan—for fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. As of this writing, 100% of India's logic and memory chips must be imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## Historical Context: Semiconductor Complex Limited (SCL)

In the 1980s, the Indian government attempted to establish its own semiconductor manufacturing industry, following the example of countries like China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, and Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This effort led to the founding of Semiconductor Complex Limited (SCL) in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

*   **Establishment and Goals**
    *   SCL was a 100% state-owned enterprise with a goal to design and manufacture leading-edge circuits and electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The vision was for SCL to be the foundation for a native Indian electronics industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   The government invested between $40-70 million USD into the venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   SCL was headquartered in Mohali, Punjab, which was emerging as an electronics industry center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   The company recruited young graduates from top technical universities like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institute of Science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Technology Acquisition and Progress**
    *   SCL licensed 5-micron process technology from American Microsystems Inc. (AMI) in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   Further technology was acquired from Rockwell for microprocessor manufacturing and Hitachi for electronic wristwatch components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   The company also performed third-party assembly, notably assembling the BBC Acorn computer for an Indian government program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
    *   Through these agreements and academic partnerships, SCL rapidly advanced from 5-micron to 0.8-micron (800 nanometer) process technology in the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. At this point, SCL was only one semiconductor generation behind leading companies like NTT, Toshiba, and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **The Devastating Fire of 1989**
    *   In 1989, a fire broke out at SCL, the cause of which remains unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. While some speculate arson due to military processor production, semiconductor fires are common due to flammable chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   The fire was a devastating setback, releasing toxic and corrosive gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    *   Production did not restart until 1997, after eight years and over $50 million in financial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
    *   During this period, new entrants like TSMC (founded 1987) and Samsung quickly gained global market share, leaving India far behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## SCL's Decline and Restructuring

Following the fire, the Indian government made several failed attempts to revive SCL as a competitive entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>:

*   **Failed Commercialization:** Proposals to sell the fab to private investors failed due to disagreements on terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Retooling the fab from telephone exchange chips to smart card chips also did not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Restructuring as R&D Center:** In 2005, SCL was restructured as an R&D center within the Department of Space, effectively ending its commercial aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Commercial Weakness:** Even with government contracts, SCL's offerings were not competitive domestically or abroad, leading to losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. By its final year as a commercial entity (2005-2006), SCL reported a $2 million USD loss on $3.5 million revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Slow Development Today:** SCL's old 6-inch wafer fab mostly performs R&D work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. In 2019, they announced the ability to accept chip designs at the 180 nanometer node, which is far from the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This progress was extremely sluggish, taking nearly a decade to reach that node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

## Current [[challenges_in_indias_semiconductor_manufacturing | Challenges in India's Semiconductor Manufacturing]]

The [[government_efforts_and_obstacles_in_reviving_indias_semiconductor_industry | government has attempted to revive]] India's semiconductor manufacturing efforts since SCL's decline, but all efforts have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

*   **Prohibitive Capital Costs:** The sheer amount of capital required to build competitive fabs is cited as the single most significant obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Today's leading-edge chip factories cost tens of billions of dollars, a trend that escalated around the 14 nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. For context, TSMC spends $20 billion on just one gigafab over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Failed Initiatives:**
    *   **2006 Fab City Project:** A $3 billion dollar project for manufacturing was announced, with interest from AMD for an assembly and test facility, but it was shut down due to poor industry conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
    *   **2013 Customs Duty Lift:** India lifted customs duties on all imports for semiconductor manufacturing, but it did not jumpstart any foundry efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
    *   **2014 Fab Proposals:** Two investor groups, including one involving JP Associates, Israel's TowerJazz, and IBM, and another led by Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (HSMC) with expertise from STMicroelectronics and Silterra, proposed building fabs costing $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The government offered significant financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. However, JP Associates pulled out in 2016 due to debt and commercial viability concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. HSMC's proposal was canceled in 2019 due to a failure to submit commitment documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## Current [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics | Global Semiconductor Supply Chain Dynamics]] and [[impact_of_the_pandemic_on_semiconductor_supply_chains | Impact on India]]

India's reliance on imports exposes it to significant risks and impacts from global supply chain issues:

*   **High Import Dependency:** India imported $21 billion worth of semiconductors in 2019, a number growing at about 15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability to Shortages:** In 2020, India was affected by the worldwide semiconductor shortage, disrupting critical Indian businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. For example, India is the world's second-largest smartphone maker, an industry that grinds to a halt without the necessary chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **[[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_semiconductor_industry | Geopolitical Repercussions]]:** A significant portion of these imports (37% or $7 billion in 2019) comes from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Given tense Sino-Indian relations, this dependency poses critical geopolitical risks and potential for further disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

### Conclusion

While India possesses world-class [[indias_design_capabilities_in_the_semiconductor_industry | chip design capabilities]] and human talent, the [[challenges_in_indias_semiconductor_manufacturing | lack of substantial semiconductor fabrication capacity]] leaves it entirely dependent on imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. For India, the market has long passed the point where a private entity can seed a thriving semiconductor manufacturing industry without external assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. To address this, consistent, long-term direction from the government and substantial financial commitment are required to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

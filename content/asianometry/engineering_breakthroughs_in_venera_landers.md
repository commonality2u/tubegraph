The **[[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Soviet Union's Venera program]]** in the 1970s and 1980s achieved the remarkable feat of landing five probes on the surface of Venus, each surviving for over 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This represented a stunning engineering achievement, given the incredibly hostile Venusian environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Challenges of Venus

Venus is considered one of the most difficult places in the Solar System to land, second only to the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Often called Earth's "evil twin," Venus started similarly to Earth but underwent a runaway greenhouse effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Key challenges include:
*   **Extreme Temperatures** The surface reaches 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 Celsius), hotter than Mercury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Immense Pressure** Surface pressure is equivalent to being over 0.5 miles (1 kilometer) underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Corrosive Atmosphere** Clouds are made of sulfuric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Atmospheric Entry Heat** Friction during entry can heat a probe to 11,000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

While Americans focused on lunar landings, they never attempted to land a legitimate probe on Venus, a feat the Soviets accomplished five times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Early Attempts and Lessons Learned (Venera 4, 5, 6)

The Venera project, named after the Russian word for Venus, aimed to land a probe on the planet's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Despite 11 prior failures, the program transferred to the Lavochkin aerospace company for Venera 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Venera 4 (1967)
Venera 4 was a large probe, 11 feet (3.5 meters) tall, with its lander consisting of instruments and a battery inside a pressure shell with a parachute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Entry**: The probe entered the atmosphere, enduring temperatures of 11,000 degrees Celsius and forces up to 450G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Failure**: It transmitted atmospheric data but was crushed 93 minutes into the mission, 27 kilometers above the surface, at 22 atmospheres of pressure and 530 degrees Fahrenheit (277 Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Realization**: Data shared with the American Mariner 5 probe confirmed Venus was far hotter, drier, and more hostile than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Venera 5 and 6 (1969)
Due to tight deadlines, major redesigns for Venera 5 and 6 were impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Engineers could only strengthen the landing probes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Venera 5**: Transmitted for 53 minutes before succumbing to 27 atmospheres and 600 degrees Fahrenheit (320 Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Venera 6**: Lasted 51 minutes, descending 37.8 kilometers before being crushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Mastering the Environment (Venera 7 and 8)

For the 1970 launch window, engineers were determined to reach the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, now understanding the extreme conditions: 840 degrees Fahrenheit (450 Celsius), 100 atmospheres, and corrosive acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Engineering for Survival (Venera 7)
*   **Design Consultation**: Engineers consulted submarine designers for tips on surviving deep pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Materials and Testing**: Sourced new materials and utilized a hotter, stronger test chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Parachute Modification**: Modified the parachute to make the lander fall faster, with a restricting cord designed to melt at 390 degrees Fahrenheit (200 Celsius) to fully open the chute for a soft landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Lander Structure**: Built in an egg shape from smooth titanium, minimizing ports, welds, or sub-structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Internal Protection**: Lined with shock absorbers and an unknown insulation layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. The chamber was pre-chilled to freezing temperatures before entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Venera 7's Landing and Discovery
Venera 7 reached Venus in December 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Descent**: Transmitted data for 35 minutes through the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Mishap**: Six minutes into the second stage, the chute melted or tore, causing a free-fall impact at 35 miles (60 kilometers) per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Unexpected Survival**: Despite the hard landing, which misaligned its antenna, Venera 7 continued transmitting a weak signal for 23 minutes, reaching temperatures hot enough to melt zinc or lead before its shell cracked and it melted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This data, along with that from Venera 8 (a similar design launched in 1972), paved the way for a new generation of probes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## Photographic Triumphs (Venera 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14)

By 1975, with five years of experience since Venera 7, Soviet engineers understood what to expect and designed probes for more ambitious goals, including sending back the first photographs of the Venusian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Venera 9 and 10 (1975)
New rockets allowed for significantly larger probes; Venera 9 and 10 were five times heavier than their predecessors, weighing 5 tons (5,000 kilograms) each at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Components**: Each mission included an orbiter and a lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Entry Capsule**: A spherical capsule covered in an asbestos composite, designed to endure heat and split in half to eject the lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Lander Design**:
    *   **Hermetically Sealed Sphere**: A 6.5-foot (2-meter) tall lander housed a hermetically sealed titanium sphere (2.6 feet / 80 centimeters wide) for instruments, bolted with gold wire seals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
    *   **Heat Management**: Inside, beryllium shelves and electric fans evenly dispersed heat to prevent instrument failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
    *   **Advanced Insulation**: The sphere's interior was lined with a forgotten polyurethane foam, wrapped in 5 inches (12 centimeters) of honeycomb composite insulation, and then another layer of titanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
    *   **Shock Absorption**: A shock-absorbing ring was placed at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
    *   **Aerobrake**: A titanium disk, resembling a hat, served as an aerobrake, replacing the problematic two-stage parachute design. The parachute detached at 30 miles (50 kilometers) above the surface, with the aerobrake handling the rest of the descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This was tested by throwing it from an airplane at 8.7 miles (14 kilometers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Cameras**: Two cameras were placed in the middle of the lander, equipped with "goldfish bowl lenses" and protected by special pure quartz pressure windows, capable of capturing both the surface and horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Images were 512x128 pixels, transmitted one line every 3.5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Survival**: Scientists estimated the probes would last about an hour on the surface, sufficient for sending the full panorama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Success**: Both probes landed as planned, with their parachutes cutting at 50 kilometers, hitting the ground at about 15 miles (25 kilometers) per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Venera 9 sent back the first pictures of the Venusian surface, and both transmitted for 50-60 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

### Venera 11 and 12 (1978)
These missions performed interesting science, but camera failures due to a mysterious electrical anomaly meant their achievements were largely forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### Venera 13 and 14 (1982)
These probes refined the successful principles of Venera 9 and 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Improvements**: Enhanced cameras, scientific instruments, and new heat-resistant technologies were incorporated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Guaranteed Lifespan**: They were rated to last at least 30 minutes on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
*   **Color Imaging**: Capable of taking color images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **External Sensors**: Many sensors and instruments could now be mounted *outside* the spherical pressure chamber, made of platinum and covered in acid-resistant enamel, demonstrating engineers' deep understanding of the Venusian environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Audio Capture**: Probes also carried microphones, though the audio wasn't immediately released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

## Conclusion

Venera 15 and 16, launched later, replaced the lander components with radar to map Venusian topography from orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. The Venera series stands as an amazing engineering achievement and the pinnacle of **[[soviet_space_exploration_achievements_and_failures | Soviet space exploration]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. Despite the shift in focus to the Moon and Mars in subsequent space programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, the **[[future_possibilities_for_venus_exploration | possibility of sending another lander to Venus]]** remains, as engineers now know it can be done, even with decades-old technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Overcoming the immense **[[challenges_of_landing_on_venus | challenges of landing on Venus]]** required innovative solutions that paved the way for our understanding of the planet.

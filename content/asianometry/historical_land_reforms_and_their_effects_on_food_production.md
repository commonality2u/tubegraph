The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), also known as North Korea, has long pursued a goal of becoming [[north_koreas_quest_for_food_selfsufficiency | self-sufficient in food production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Reliable information about the country's [[challenges_and_reforms_in_north_koreas_agricultural_sector | agricultural instability]] and the [[government_reforms_and_international_relations | government's]] actions is often difficult to obtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Geographical and Historical Context

Historically, the northern part of Korea was its industrial heartland, while the south served as its breadbasket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The [[impact_of_geography_and_climate_on_north_korean_agriculture | geography]] of North Korea reflects this, with 80% of its land composed of mountains and uplands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Most of the country's 25 million people reside on the coastal plains and lowlands of the west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Only about 15% of North Korea's land is arable, though this is still more than the global average of 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The majority of farms are located on the west coast, where conditions are more favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The cropping season is short, with harsh winters and short, hot, humid, and rainy summers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. A significant 60% of the DPRK's rain falls between June and September, making it vulnerable to droughts and floods, exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure and [[environmental_impact_of_irans_dam_and_agricultural_projects | deforestation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Post-War Land Reforms and Collectivization

Upon its founding, the DPRK's Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) inherited an industrialized society from the Japanese occupation government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. North Korea held 72% of the peninsula's industrial capacity and over 90% of its hydroelectric capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Much of this was seized by the WPK regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Land belonging to Korean landlords and Japanese colonialists was also seized and redistributed to the peasantry between 1945 and 1946, which could be considered a land reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:49]</a>.

However, the Korean War (1950-1953) ravaged the peninsula, causing immense population upheaval and annihilating its industrial infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:12]</a>. After the war, North Korea turned to China and the Soviet Union for aid and guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:25]</a>. Domestically, the DPRK adopted a centrally planned economy, patterned after the Soviet Union, aiming to suppress markets. The state owned all businesses and provided all jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:56]</a>.

The state seized all land and established two types of farms: cooperatives and state farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:04:02]</a>. Farmers were restricted to working on these collective farms, with no private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:07]</a>. The state owned all food grown on these lands and confiscated it for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:11]</a>. Eternal Leader Kim Il-sung pushed for this collectivization to make the DPRK [[north_koreas_quest_for_food_selfsufficiency | self-reliant in food production]], aligning with the state ideology of self-reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Initial Challenges and Responses

This collectivization drive, criticized even by communist bloc peers, led to food shortages in the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:41]</a>. In response, the [[government_reforms_and_international_relations | North Korean government]] heavily promoted the use of fertilizers, pesticides, tractors, and irrigation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:52]</a>. While yields stabilized, the [[challenges_and_reforms_in_north_koreas_agricultural_sector | agricultural sector]] became dangerously dependent on raw inputs like oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Economic Decline and Famine (1980s-1990s)

North Korea accumulated vast debts to the Soviet Union and China over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:05]</a>. This led to the Soviets withdrawing various subsidies in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:12]</a>. In the same year, the DPRK instituted a range of new [[economic_policies_and_their_influence_on_north_korean_agriculture | agricultural reforms]], emphasizing double cropping, increased fertilizer use, and expanding arable land by raising forests, reclaiming tidal land, and clearing hillsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:27]</a>. These intense practices led to [[challenges_and_reforms_in_north_koreas_agricultural_sector | soil depletion and acidification]] and yielded only marginal new land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:41]</a>.

The collapse of the Soviet Union caused North Korea to lose its primary source of coal, oil, and steel, which had accounted for up to two-thirds of its two-way trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:57]</a>. The loss of oil significantly hampered fertilizer production and irrigation infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:06:03]</a>. North Korea turned to China, which by 1993, provided 77% of its fuel and 68% of its food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:14]</a>. However, in 1994, China began experiencing its own grain issues and reduced trade with North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:24]</a>.

By 1993, certain provinces were already experiencing famine conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:51]</a>. Food rations were delayed or suspended, and by 1994, the [[government_reforms_and_international_relations | government]] entirely ended food shipments to four provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:07:05]</a>. In 1995, coercive seizures of grain from farms began, and prison camps were established for those caught foraging for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:14]</a>. Concurrently, major floods affected the country's western provinces in 1995 and 1996, damaging terraces and silting fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:37]</a>. While the [[government_reforms_and_international_relations | government]] exaggerated the extent of the damage, floods contributed to the food crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:58]</a>.

[[government_reforms_and_international_relations | International food aid]] helped, but not all of it reached those most in need due to disputes and a lack of accountability, leading many charitable organizations to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:34]</a>. Death estimates for the 1990s famine range from 220,000 to 3.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Post-Famine [[economic_policies_and_their_influence_on_north_korean_agriculture | Economic Reforms]]

Since the 1990s, North Korea's [[challenges_and_reforms_in_north_koreas_agricultural_sector | agricultural production]] has improved due to a combination of [[government_reforms_and_international_relations | international aid]], favorable weather, and [[economic_policies_and_their_influence_on_north_korean_agriculture | economic reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:17]</a>.

After the famine, the [[government_reforms_and_international_relations | government]] allowed households to own and cultivate private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:46]</a>. These small gardens, where people grow potatoes, corn, and vegetables, are well-cared for and have significantly improved the country's food security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:58]</a>.

In 2012, the Kim Jong-un [[government_reforms_and_international_relations | government]] implemented [[economic_policies_and_their_influence_on_north_korean_agriculture | economic policy changes]] to devolve more authority to lower levels within collective farms, allowing workers to make more decisions regarding material and investment planning instead of just following party orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:16]</a>. While not as sweeping as China's agricultural reforms, this marked a step forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:23]</a>. The extent of these reforms and their impact on the bottom line remain uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Ongoing Agricultural Challenges

North Korea continues to face significant challenges in its [[challenges_and_reforms_in_north_koreas_agricultural_sector | agricultural sector]]:

*   **Deteriorating [[challenges_and_reforms_in_north_koreas_agricultural_sector | Soil Quality]]**: Aggressive plowing and tilling, coupled with heavy use of chemical fertilizers, have caused [[challenges_and_reforms_in_north_koreas_agricultural_sector | soil acidification]], hindering air and water absorption and nutrient uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:11:13]</a>. The aggressive practice of double cropping also depletes the land's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Reluctance to Adopt Sustainable Practices**: Despite the benefits of rotating in legumes to improve [[challenges_and_reforms_in_north_koreas_agricultural_sector | soil fertility]] (e.g., increasing nitrogen and water retention) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:12:08]</a>, farmers are reluctant due to fear of not meeting government-set wheat production goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Lack of Technology and Funding**: Farmers often lack adequate farming technology like tractors suited for smaller, irregularly shaped fields, and face shortages of energy or parts to maintain existing equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:46]</a>. This is partly attributed to the country's inability to raise funds, with the DPRK blaming American trade sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **[[environmental_impact_of_irans_dam_and_agricultural_projects | Deforestation]]**: Intense efforts to expand arable land have involved cutting down trees on hillsides for terraces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:50]</a>. Lands with slopes above 15 percent, with poor quality soils, have been cultivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:59]</a>. This [[environmental_impact_of_irans_dam_and_agricultural_projects | deforestation]] exacerbates floods by removing trees that hold down soil, leading to erosion and siltation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:21]</a>. Floods have been noticeably more destructive since the 1980s when these efforts began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:36]</a>. It also impacts the rural population, 77% of whom rely on wood for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:50]</a>.

## Food Distribution Networks

Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen notes that famines result from both food crop failure and the collapse of food distribution networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:15:00]</a>. During the DPRK's central planning era, the state collected harvests and distributed rations based on occupation and household size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:19]</a>. During the famine, oil shortages made food distribution difficult, leading to the collapse of the rationing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:27]</a>.

Ordinary North Koreans resorted to illegal private markets, often run by women, for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:47]</a>. After the famine, the [[government_reforms_and_international_relations | government]] initially cracked down but eventually formalized these markets, providing housing, facilities, and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:16:00]</a>. Today, defectors report that most ordinary North Koreans acquire food from these markets and private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:13]</a>. While the [[government_reforms_and_international_relations | government]] has attempted to revitalize the old food ration system, it is believed that rations primarily go to the country's political and economic elites to retain their support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:44]</a>.

Kim Jong-un has repeatedly emphasized improving people's lives through increased food production, though concrete policy solutions for agricultural improvement remain vague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:32]</a>. While distribution has improved and famine is no longer a major threat, North Korea's [[challenges_and_reforms_in_north_koreas_agricultural_sector | agricultural situation]] still falls short of [[north_koreas_quest_for_food_selfsufficiency | self-sufficiency]] due to decades of soil damage and abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:58]</a>.

The semiconductor industry is currently facing a significant [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | chip shortage]], with its greatest impact felt not at the [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | leading edge]] of technology, but in [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | trailing edge]] semiconductors [00:00:44]. These older, less "sexy" chips are unheralded workhorses [00:01:17] and are critical for a wide range of applications, including automation, metering, and industrial manufacturing [00:00:21].

## What are Trailing Edge Semiconductors?
Most chips are not advanced three-nanometer devices [00:01:16]; instead, they are built using [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | trailing edge]] process nodes [00:01:24].
*   **Definition** TSMC defines [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | trailing edge]] nodes as anything 16 nanometers or older, which accounted for approximately 50% of their 2021 revenue [00:01:33].
*   **Subdivisions** [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | Trailing edge]] nodes can be further subdivided into:
    *   **Mature nodes** Generally considered to be in the 40 to 450 nanometer range [00:01:52].
    *   **Legacy nodes** Anything older than mature nodes [00:01:59].
*   **Examples** Most microcontrollers (MCUs), such as the ATS AMD 21, are made with 110 or 180 nanometer processes [00:02:01]. This particular MCU, a 48 megahertz ARM chip, is currently out of stock for the next year [00:00:26].
*   **Fabrication** There are approximately 200 active fabs globally, most of which were built before 2000 [00:02:10]. These factories, initially equipped to produce leading-edge chips with high margins, eventually see their product prices collapse as they commoditize [00:02:17]. However, once built, a fab can continue operating as long as the market price is above its variable costs [00:02:46].

## The Shortage in Trailing Edge Semiconductors
Capacity for [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | trailing edge]] nodes was already tight for several years before the pandemic [00:03:00].
*   **Pandemic Impact**
    *   **Initial Downturn** In early 2020, pandemic lockdowns led to a sharp decline in economic activity, with automotive companies and other manufacturers halting production and canceling orders [00:03:10]. This caused suppliers like ST Microelectronics to cut production by 50% [00:03:25].
    *   **Unexpected Bounce Back** The summer of 2020 saw a massive, unexpected economic rebound, leading to a scramble for products and resulting shortages [00:03:38]. Companies depleted inventories, then began ordering more than needed to replenish stock and guarantee future output [00:03:50].
*   **Increased Demand** The broader semiconductor industry has experienced unprecedented demand due to the cloud, the wireless 5G transition, and armed conflict [00:04:02].
*   **Capacity Limits** Since 2019, fab utilization rates have soared to the mid-90s, far exceeding their long-term target of 80%, indicating that foundries are at the limit of what they can produce from existing facilities [00:04:13]. Microchip executive chairman Steve Sanghi estimates that $150 billion in additional investment is needed over the next five years to meet [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | trailing edge]] demand growth [00:04:29].

## Obstacles to Expansion
Despite the clear need, building out [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | trailing edge]] capacity is very slow, growing at about 2% annually compared to over 25% at the leading edge [00:04:41]. Only 6% of the hundreds of billions committed to new fabs is for mature or legacy nodes [00:04:50].

### Financial Hesitancy
*   **Price Expectations** [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | Trailing edge]] chipmakers are hesitant to invest because customers are accustomed to low prices set by foundries with fully depreciated fabs [00:05:15].
*   **Low Margins** Wafers for these nodes are very cheap, and despite contributing significant microprocessor volume, they account for only 10% of total sales revenues [00:05:25].
*   **Underutilization Risk** Even with heightened demand, spending hundreds of millions or billions on a new fab carries the expectation of substantial underutilization and financial underperformance, leading companies to prefer sticking with existing backlogs [00:05:35].

### Equipment and Technology Challenges
*   **Older Niche Equipment** Many [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | trailing edge]] fabs use older, niche equipment. Over 200 fabs, for instance, make 200 millimeter wafers, which are smaller and older than the current 300 millimeter industry standard [00:05:53]. New 200 millimeter equipment is not readily available, so companies buy refurbished items from resellers [00:06:04].
*   **Slowing Upscaling Trend** The industry trend of companies scaling up their designs to newer nodes has slowed [00:06:32]. It's becoming harder to move to the next node, as customers must balance benefits against increasing costs [00:06:35].
*   **Non-Scaling Chips** Some types of chips, such as analog mixed-signal, radio frequency chips [00:06:44], and MEMS (specialty silicon found in accelerometers) [00:06:50], do not scale well to smaller nodes [00:06:43]. Demand for these is through the roof, especially given global conflicts [00:06:56].
*   **The 28-22 Nanometer Generation Gap**
    *   **Planar vs. FinFET** The 28 nanometer node is likely the most advanced that still uses a planar gate [00:07:05]. Anything newer requires dealing with more complex FinFET gates, rampant multi-patterning concerns, and potentially [[challenges_in_developing_commercial_euv_systems | EUV]] lithography [00:07:14].
    *   **Complexity and Cost** These newer technologies contribute to additional complexity, less reliable products, lower yields, and higher costs [00:07:23]. The 28 nanometer node represents the bottom of the cost curve on a per 100 million gate basis, with costs increasing at newer nodes due to these factors [00:07:30].
    *   **Customer Needs** Customers often do not need chips that are much faster, especially if it means dealing with these trade-offs [00:07:42]. Automotive companies, in particular, prioritize reliability and effectiveness in challenging conditions [00:07:49] and are major consumers of [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | trailing edge]] chips, accounting for 40% of market demand [00:07:56].

## Efforts to Address the Shortage
The industry will eventually have to act as backlogs for older nodes stretch to 18 months or longer [00:08:03].
*   **Building New Fabs**
    *   **TSMC** Is building two new [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | trailing edge]] fabs in Japan and Gaoxiong, operating on the 28-22 nanometer node range [00:08:30]. TSMC recently announced price increases on older nodes to help fund these new fabs [00:08:39].
    *   **Samsung** Has announced increased investment in [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | trailing edge]] semiconductor capacity, a significant step for a company typically focused on the latest technology [00:08:46].
    *   **China** Has up to a dozen new fabs under construction [00:08:58]. SMIC, a leading Chinese foundry, is spending over $9 billion to add [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | trailing edge]] wafer capacity in Shanghai and Shenzhen [00:09:03].
    *   **India** The conglomerate Vedanta and Foxconn are partnering to build a [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | trailing edge]] fab in the 65 to 28 nanometer range with substantial government support [00:09:14].
    *   **U.S. CHIPS Act** This American bill authorizes incentives for the construction and modernization of the semiconductor industry, appropriating $2 billion specifically for "mature technology nodes" [00:09:26].

*   **Improving Existing Fabs**
    *   **Wafer Upgrades** Converting from 200 millimeter wafers to 300 millimeter wafers can yield over two times as many dies [00:10:00]. While a substantial upgrade requiring floor layout changes and automation, it doubles output without needing a new fab [00:10:12].

*   **Design-Side Improvements**
    *   **Open Source EDA/PDKs** New tools and open-source EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software and PDKs (Process Design Kits) aim to make hardware development cheaper and easier for designers [00:10:27]. This includes enabling easier die shrinks onto other nodes [00:10:37]. An example is the open-source 130 nanometer PDK released by Google and SkyWater Technologies, which could lead to long-delayed die shrinks and provide consumers with faster, better chips [00:10:43].

## Outlook
These solutions will take time, at least one to two years [00:10:59], meaning [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | trailing edge]] supply constraints are expected to continue until at least 2023 [00:11:02]. However, some positive signs are emerging: revenue growth for [[leading_edge_vs_trailing_edge_semiconductors | trailing edge]] nodes is slowing, major players and countries like China and India are building new fabs, and an apparent slowdown in the macro economy could dampen overall demand, potentially aligning with new supply capacity hitting the market [00:11:08].

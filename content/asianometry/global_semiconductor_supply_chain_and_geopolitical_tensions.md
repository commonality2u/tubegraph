In late August 2023, Huawei began selling its own phone chips again with the release of the Huawei Mate 60 Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The phone's system-on-a-chip (SOC), the Kirin 9000s (麒麟9000s), is a 7-nanometer class chip, likely manufactured by SMIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This development has caused a significant stir in the global semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## The Huawei Mate 60 Pro and its Kirin 9000s Chip

The Kirin 9000s chip is a 107 square millimeter die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, slightly larger than previous Kirin 9000 series chips, which were briefly produced using TSMC's 5-nanometer process until American sanctions halted that partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This new 7-nanometer class chip is estimated to be about 5-6 years behind the current leading edge, with [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]] shipping 3-nanometer class chips for devices like the iPhone 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Teardowns and speed tests indicate the Kirin 9000s supports 5G connectivity, although Huawei appears to be concealing this functionality in press releases and the phone's operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The SoC features a customized CPU core based on Arm IP and a new custom GPU designed by Huawei or HiSilicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

Initial reports suggest that SMIC's early yields for this node are higher than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. As more phones are sold, yields are expected to ramp up, similar to how [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]] scaled its N7 yields for iPhone launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The development of this 7nm chip represents significant progress for SMIC in approximately one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Why the Surprise?

The appearance of this chip was, in some ways, anticipated. Previous discussions hinted at a HiSilicon (Huawei) chip utilizing SMIC's N+2 process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Furthermore, Nikkei Asia had mentioned SMIC and Huawei collaborating on a new 5G chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. News of the SMIC N+2 process emerged in July 2022, initially used for Bitcoin miners, which are simpler chips beneficial for node improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

Experts like Dr. Burn Lin, a former [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]] R&D director, had stated in January 2022 that SMIC could fabricate even 5-nanometer class chips using only multi-patterning with immersion lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Immersion lithography, while decades old, remains critical, with 193-nanometer immersion machines performing 70-80% of lithography work for leading foundries even today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The US initially banned EUV lithography exports, but a ban on 193i machines was delayed until June 30, 2023, when the Netherlands and Japan joined export restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This suggests SMIC still possesses sufficient machines to ramp up 7nm production and potentially move to 5nm in the next 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## An Emerging China-Only Supply Chain

The Mate 60 Pro goes beyond a high-performing chip; it is largely built within an ecosystem of domestic Chinese suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Bloomberg reported the phone's many domestic suppliers, including for the radio frequency front-end module and satellite communications modem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. With the exception of memory, which appears to be from SK Hynix, the entire phone is essentially a China-only ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

This indicates the formation of a self-contained ecosystem within the People's Republic of China capable of producing various domestic electronics, including smartphone SOCs, CPUs, edge AI NPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The emergence of such a robust domestic supply chain will likely impact companies like Qualcomm, Apple, and MediaTek, as Kirin 9000s and similar chips are expected to replace sales previously made by non-Chinese semiconductor makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This also suggests the potential for Chinese 7-nanometer AI accelerators in 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## Geopolitical Implications and Future Strategies

### China's Approach

China aims to widely distribute the Mate 60 Pro to scale up production and improve yields, fostering profitability and funding further advancement to 5 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This includes targeting not only domestic consumers but also markets in Europe, Australia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Huawei is actively promoting ways to integrate Google products onto its phones to overcome challenges related to their absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

Additionally, SMIC should focus on replicating and reviewing advanced packaging technology for future AI applications, including chiplets and 2.5D die-stacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. The Chinese Government will also need to strengthen its domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment ecosystem to replace foreign suppliers like ASML, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, Lam Research, and metrology companies, as foreign equipment may be subject to remote disabling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### United States' Response

The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security justified its October 7th restrictions on foreign support for "advanced semiconductors," defined as logic ICs at 16/14nm or below, citing concerns about [[national_security_concerns_related_to_semiconductor_technology_transfer | military modernization]], weapons of mass destruction, and human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The US government believes that China's ability to manufacture advanced logic chips has significant implications for the regional military balance of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

Given SMIC and Huawei's progress, if the US government perceives a Chinese 7-nanometer node as a national security threat, it may intensify efforts to halt its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This would require better understanding and control of semiconductor manufacturing equipment still reaching China, as SMIC relies on foreign equipment for this node, and domestic suppliers remain years behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

Currently, equipment companies like Applied Materials, Lam Research, Tokyo Electron, and KLA can sell most of their tools, even those usable for 7nm and 5nm processes, ostensibly for lagging-edge nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. To prevent China from developing leading-edge capacity at scale, the US government, in cooperation with allies, should consider tighter export controls on tools being repurposed, such as Argon Fluoride Immersion lithography, mask, and CMP equipment, and limit licenses for firms like SMIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Kirin 9000s chip is a significant milestone, drawing parallels to Samsung's historical achievement in 1986, when its 1-megabit DRAM chip closed the Korean-Japanese semiconductor gap from five years to just one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Two years later, Samsung achieved parity with Japanese technology with its 4-megabit chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. China appears to be adopting a similar strategy to South Korea in semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. This development marks a visible point in technology history, creating ripples that extend far beyond the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

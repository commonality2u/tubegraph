Today, Europe is a minor producer and consumer of chips, with EU firms accounting for a small percentage of semiconductor design, fabrication, and assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While there are world-leading equipment and chemicals companies like ASML, STMicroelectronics, and Infineon, the overall presence is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This position was not inevitable, as Europeans independently invented the first transistor just months after the Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Early Semiconductor Development and Decline (1940s-1950s)

Europe, particularly France, was an early research pioneer in semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This early optimistic lead was, however, squandered, leading to a persistent lag in the decades since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### The European Transistor

In 1948, just six months after Bell Labs created the first transistor in 1947, two scientists in Paris, Herbert Matera and Heinrich Welker, announced a similar invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Matera and Welker had studied semiconductor materials during World War II for the German radar program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. After the war, unable to conduct research in occupied Germany, they relocated to France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. In Paris, at a Westinghouse subsidiary, they worked on mass-producing germanium rectifiers and concurrently studied an electrical effect Welker had observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This led to their development of the point-contact transistor, conceptually similar to Bell Labs' invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

France's Secretary of Post, Telephones, and Telegraphs, Eugene Thomas, urged them to patent their invention, which he named "Transistron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. In May 1949, Thomas held a press conference announcing the Transistron's superiority to vacuum tubes, an achievement lauded in the French press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Patents for the Transistron were granted in the U.S. in 1951 and France in 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Westinghouse built a factory in France capable of producing tens of thousands of Transistrons monthly for telephone systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Early Challenges

Despite early achievements, the French effort consistently struggled with manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. The unpredictability of early semiconductor manufacturing led interdisciplinary teams to turn towards more abstract and theoretical research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Several factors contributed to this early decline:
*   **Government Priorities**: Shortly after the Transistron announcement, the French government shifted its focus and resources to developing nuclear technology, leaving the telecommunications industry as private industry without government funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Struggles**: France's early semiconductor achievements by 1949 were impressive, but the French effort constantly struggled with manufacturing. This caused them to turn towards more abstract research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Lack of Industry-Government Initiatives**: France lacked joint business-government initiatives to bring theoretical breakthroughs to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Pierre Aigrain, a prominent French physicist, taught a generation of semiconductor researchers, most of whom remained in theoretical space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Underinvestment in R&D**: French businesses underinvested in R&D, with a survey showing less than a quarter of companies having in-house R&D labs between 1880 and 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The French electronics industry continued using outdated vacuum tube technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Transistorized French radios did not widely appear until around 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Economic Instability**: France experienced economic and political crises in 1957-1958, partly due to the Algerian War, leading to austerity policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The French transistor industry, 90% dependent on government funding, suffered from cuts, forcing consumer electronics companies to turn to imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Falling currency values eroded profits and impeded future investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

By the end of the 1950s, the French semiconductor industry had squandered its early lead, falling behind Japan and other European peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### Contrast with the American Approach

The American semiconductor industry, by contrast, corralled early unpredictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>:
*   **Knowledge Dissemination**: Bell Labs openly held symposia, detailing production knowledge and liberally granting licenses due to antitrust concerns and a belief in spreading knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Licensees, including Texas Instruments, contributed new innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Interdisciplinary Teams**: American teams were more interdisciplinary than French teams, exemplified by the "Traitorous Eight" co-founders of Fairchild Semiconductor, recruited by William Shockley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Hands-on Process Improvement**: Shockley encouraged scientists to handle technological processes themselves, leading to innovations like Dr. Jean Hoerni's planar process, which allowed Fairchild to produce reliable transistors at high scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## The Integrated Circuit Era (1960s)

The 1960s saw the rise of the integrated circuit (IC), jointly invented in 1958 by Texas Instruments and Fairchild Semiconductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Military Demand vs. Consumer Demand

The U.S. military played a critical role in shaping the American semiconductor industry, buying half of its total output by the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Projects like the Minuteman II ICBM and the Apollo program (the largest consumer of integrated circuits between 1961 and 1965) drove demand for smaller, lower-power, and reliable devices, forcing American firms to develop high-performing technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

In contrast, European semiconductor demand in the 1960s primarily came from the consumer sector, not government or military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Military demand was 50% of the U.S. market in 1960, but only 29% in France and 8% in West Germany and Italy in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Consumer demand, focused on price, led European electronics giants like Philips and Siemens to prioritize evolutionary improvements to their in-house transistor technologies, often using germanium, which was cheaper but had mechanical performance limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. They believed silicon was only suitable for high-temperature applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

American companies like Fairchild, Intel, and AMD, focused on semiconductors as an end product, discovered more disruptive silicon-based technologies, widening the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Fairchild's mass production of silicon planar transistors obsoleted the entire alloy-junction transistor space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

### Comparison with Japan

Japan, starting in a similar position to France or Germany, rapidly adopted transistor technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
[[comparative_analysis_of_semiconductor_industry_growth_in_europe_us_and_japan | The Japanese consumer electronics industry]] rapidly adopted transistor technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. The Japanese government encouraged radio and television adoption, and gated imports, allowing its industry to build semiconductor manufacturing competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Mass semiconductor production grew 125 times in the latter half of the 1950s, matching American levels by 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Japanese companies also signed over 250 technology licensing agreements from 1952 to 1968, mastering acquisitions and producing their own innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. In contrast, while foreign companies like IBM and Texas Instruments built factories in Europe, successful technology transfer did not happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

### French Policy and Production Scale

In 1961, the French government's plan to support its domestic calculator and computer industries inadvertently turned them against the nascent semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Computer companies claimed French semiconductors were not competitive in quantity or quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. In 1966, France launched "Plan Calcul," a computer development program driven by IBM's dominance and U.S. export restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. With the primary goal of a national computer as quickly as possible, the domestic French semiconductor industry slipped to the back burner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

Europe's semiconductor gap in the mid-1960s was not due to a lack of innovation, but rather a struggle with production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. French chip makers could not gain sufficient production scale or compete with aggressive cost-cutting by firms like Fairchild, which sold ICs below manufacturing cost to stimulate demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. European manufacturers survived in niche markets, such as analog circuits (e.g., Philips' analog signal receiver IC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

## The LSI/VLSI Era (1970s-1980s)

The 1970s brought rapidly increasing complexity with Intel's introduction of the first microprocessor, the Intel 4004, in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. This new era of Large-Scale Integration (LSI) meant significant resources were required for new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

### Demand Structure and Technological Lag

By 1969, computers overtook military demand as the leading driver for semiconductors in the U.S., requiring high-performance devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. Europe lacked both the production capability for high-performance LSI devices and a strong source of demand for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. European computer companies were far smaller than American ones, and traditional demand industries (military, telecommunications, consumer electronics) could not fill the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

*   **Military/Avionics**: European military and avionics demand was weak and tended to favor a small circle of large established firms, hindering disruptive technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.
*   **Telecommunications**: The Telecom market demand was fragmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   **Consumer Electronics**: European consumer electronics companies like Philips and Siemens continued to prioritize cheaper, less leading-edge chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

By 1974, Japanese IC output was only a quarter of the American industry's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. By 1978, Japan held 20% of the worldwide IC market, trailing America's 74% share, while Europe had just 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

### Government Initiatives and Their Limitations

**Japan's VLSI Project**: Alarmed by IBM's dominance, Japan launched the Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) project in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. Budgeted for hundreds of millions of dollars, it united computer makers to cooperatively develop next-generation VLSI technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. Though it didn't achieve its "one-chip computer" goal, it helped Japanese semiconductor makers hone techniques for high transistor density, rocketing them into a generational lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>.

**West Germany's Approach**: West German industrial policy was more market-oriented and decentralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Large flagship companies like Siemens and AEG, while significant domestic producers, lagged American firms by about a decade in the late 1960s, a gap that widened with LSI and VLSI technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. Despite the government budgeting $1.4 billion from 1974-1979 to advance the domestic semiconductor industry, the money was primarily funneled to these large electronics firms (Siemens receiving $1.3 billion and AEG $0.4 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. This over-reliance on conservative corporate giants like Siemens, which preferred investing in bonds over technology, proved frustrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. The decline of AEG in the 1970s further highlighted these issues, as it lost competitiveness and market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

## 1980s and 1990s: Intensifying Competition

By the 1980s, high-performing semiconductors were being made on European soil, and Europe had large semiconductor makers, but no producer capable of challenging Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. A decade of encouraging foreign chip makers to build factories in Europe only increased pressure on domestic companies like Siemens and Philips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. Europe's IT trade deficit grew significantly, reaching almost $7 billion in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>. In 1985, Siemens was the only European firm in the top 10 for gate array manufacturing, and none were in the top 10 for silicon CMOS technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

### Technology Alliances

European tech companies often formed technology alliances with American firms. For example, Ericsson's component subsidiary, Rifa, allied with National Semiconductor, then later with GEC, Plessey, AMD, and Texas Instruments, helping Ericsson build one of Europe's few fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. Philips also allied with AMD, RCA, and Texas Instruments, while Siemens partnered with Intel, Toshiba, and Fujitsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. Only 25% of European IT companies formed alliances with other European companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

### Coordinated Efforts

*   **France's Microelectronics Plan**: In 1982, President François Mitterrand unveiled a five-year microelectronics plan to spend 4.5 billion francs annually on chip R&D, university-industry connections, and company subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. However, French subsidies, while driving new investment, paled in comparison to the economic might of the Americans and Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.
*   **West Germany's Mega Project**: In 1984, West Germany launched a semiconductor R&D program with a billion Deutsche Marks over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. The high-profile Mega project involved West German and Dutch governments supporting Siemens and Philips in developing a 4-megabit DRAM and a 1-megabit SRAM by 1988, dubbed "Europe's last chance against the Japanese chip Invasion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. Siemens debuted its 4-megabit chip in March 1987. However, Siemens had to license its 1-megabit DRAM technology from Toshiba, and Philips worked with Matushita for its SRAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. The space was moving too fast, with Japan's NTT already debuting a 16-megabit DRAM chip by March 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
*   **JESSI Project**: The Mega project evolved into JESSI (Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative) in 1989, a €4 billion pan-European consortium to develop 6-megabit DRAMs and advanced custom chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. JESSI faced serious issues: Philips withdrew from memory entirely in 1990, Britain's ICL was ejected after being acquired by Fujitsu, and Siemens allied with IBM, abandoning its 16-megabit memory plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. JESSI's budget shrank, impairing its function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>. Belgium's microelectronics R&D subsidies, however, led to the founding of IMEC, a leading semiconductor research facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

By 1991, European companies had less than 30% of their own market, down from 60% of world semiconductor production in 1979 to 10% in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

### Barriers and Competition in the 1990s

The 1990s saw technological and financial barriers to semiconductor entry skyrocket, with a 250-nanometer memory fab costing $1-2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. Competition intensified with Asian companies like TSMC, Chartered Semiconductor, and Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. TSMC's pioneering independent foundry model opened gates for semiconductor outsourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

Demand structures continued to disfavor Europe:
*   Europe lost the consumer electronics space to Asian firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.
*   Military and government spending declined after the fall of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
*   Computing remained dominated by American firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.

Europe's positions in industrial, telecommunications, and automotive fields remained strong but did not capture the majority of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

## Conclusion: Why Europe Fell Behind

Europe's semiconductor decline was not due to a single reason but a situation compounded over half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>.
*   **1950s**: Europe fell behind the U.S. due to political, technological, and production issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.
*   **1960s**: Strong American military spending drove technological progress and competence, favoring smaller, disruptive spin-offs and startups over traditional vertically integrated giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.
*   **1970s**: As semiconductor competence compounded, European policy focused on building larger computers to match IBM, incorrectly disregarding semiconductors as a future focus, a mistake Japan avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.
*   **1980s-1990s**: Despite R&D successes, the semiconductor manufacturing outsourcing trend and the rise of the Asian supply chain intensified market competition, relegating European manufacturers to specialty markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

## Current State and Outlook

In the 2020s, the EU announced plans to build strategic autonomy by increasing its share in high-end chip fabrication, aiming to double Europe's share in semiconductor production from its current 10% to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>. This market share has been around 10% since 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. Historically, European governments and the EU have shown willingness to financially support their semiconductor industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. However, previous rounds of government money, R&D coordination, and forced company consolidations have not reversed the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. The question remains whether the [[eu_efforts_and_initiatives_to_revitalize_the_european_semiconductor_industry | EU Chips Act]] will change course or simply be "more of the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.

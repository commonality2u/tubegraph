[[Development of UV and EUV lithography technology | Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography]] is currently the most advanced lithography technology available for semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Its commercialization through [[ASML and highvolume EUV systems | ASML's TWINSCAN NXE series]] is anticipated to be more cost-effective for producing chips at sub-10nm nodes compared to other techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## Production and Capacity Constraints
[[ASML and the commercialization of EUV lithography | ASML]], a vital supplier of semiconductor lithography machinery, is limited in its production of [[ASML and highvolume EUV systems | high-end EUV lithography machines]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. According to [[ASML and the commercialization of EUV lithography | ASML's]] CEO, the company can only produce 50 such machines annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This constraint means that foundries like Intel and TSMC cannot increase their output of [[Technological advancements in semiconductor manufacturing | 5nm chips]] without more EUV machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

The process of assembling these machines is immensely challenging, involving thousands of suppliers and complex integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Revolutionary Nature and Supply Chain Re-engineering
[[Development of UV and EUV lithography technology | EUV]] technology fundamentally alters many traditional semiconductor fabrication principles, described as a "revolutionary" rather than "evolutionary" technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. This necessitates a complete re-engineering of [[ASML and the commercialization of EUV lithography | ASML's]] entire supply chain to accommodate the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. The shift to [[Development of UV and EUV lithography technology | EUV]] caused [[ASML and the commercialization of EUV lithography | ASML]] to radically change how it creates its machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Engineering Challenges
### Light Source
A key challenge for [[Development of UV and EUV lithography technology | EUV]] lithography is maintaining a high etching rate of wafers while minimizing yield defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. [[Engineering challenges of the EUV light source | EUV mirrors]] have low reflectivity (less than 70%), requiring an exceptionally powerful light source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This is achieved by:
*   Firing a CO2 laser at tin droplets to create plasma and ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   Using droplets specifically to reduce tin debris and prevent contamination of the light-collecting mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

Early experiments with target material delivery for the light source included a rotating cylinder, thin target tape, spray jet, and liquid filament, before settling on tiny droplets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. The narrow margin of error in the power source has wide-ranging consequences for the supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Cleanliness Standards and Pellicles
Older lithography methods use a pellicle, a 1-micrometer-wide polymer film, to prevent particles from casting shadows and ruining etched wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. However, in the [[Development of UV and EUV lithography technology | EUV]] realm, these traditional pellicles can absorb and weaken the [[Development of UV and EUV lithography technology | EUV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

Before recent advancements, this meant earlier generations of [[Development of UV and EUV lithography technology | EUV]] machines across the entire supply chain had to adhere to ultra-strict cleanliness standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>:
*   A particle as small as 52 nm (the size of a small virus) could contaminate an [[Development of UV and EUV lithography technology | EUV]] supply component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   Maintaining such cleanliness pushes the boundaries of technical feasibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   New proprietary detectors were installed at supplier premises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   Particle flushing steps were added throughout the entire build process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

These challenges contributed to the delay in [[Challenges in developing commercial EUV systems | EUV commercialization]] for several decades, despite the science proving feasible in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

::info
It has recently been announced that [[Challenges in EUV Photoresist and Metrology | pellicles]] are now available for [[Development of UV and EUV lithography technology | EUV]] machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. This development is expected to reduce the need for such stringent cleaning in the workflow, improving wafer yields and costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Cost Implications
[[Development of UV and EUV lithography technology | EUV]] equipment significantly contributes to the high cost of building new leading-edge fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Each [[Development of UV and EUV lithography technology | EUV]] machine can cost $150 million, comparable to a Boeing airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Individual components and replacement parts for these machines frequently exceed a million dollars each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

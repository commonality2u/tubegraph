While x86 chips, predominantly made by Intel and [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | AMD]], have historically been prominent in the tech community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, [[Chinas semiconductor manufacturing efforts | China's semiconductor manufacturing efforts]] have increasingly shifted towards ARM and RISC-V architectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

## Understanding ARM and RISC-V

ARM and RISC-V refer to families of instruction set architectures (ISA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. A chip design company utilizes an instruction set like ARM or RISC-V to implement and create a CPU micro-architecture, which can then lead to a family of chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Different companies can share instruction sets but still produce radically different designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. For example, Apple's self-developed ARM chips perform differently from other chips using the ARM instruction set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

Unlike x86, which was developed and popularized by Intel and then licensed out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, ARM (the company) operates on a different paradigm, licensing out its IP to other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. These companies can then manufacture and sell their own chips for use in devices such as smartphones and IoT gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. RISC-V, on the other hand, is an open-source instruction set development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

## Growing Prominence of ARM and RISC-V

While x86 CPUs still dominate for PCs, game consoles, and servers, and handle compute-intensive tasks, driving 481 of the world's top 500 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>, ARM is beginning to gain ground in areas traditionally dominated by x86, including desktops and servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

## China's Strategic Focus

[[Chinas semiconductor manufacturing efforts | China]] has long been interested in developing domestic alternatives to American technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This interest is driven by several factors:
*   The Edward Snowden revelations regarding American spying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   Increasing competition between China and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   A desire to cultivate homegrown "national champions" in critical industries like computer chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.
*   Concerns spurred by the Trump administration's actions to cut off companies like [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | Huawei]] from American technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

Within [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's indigenous semiconductor efforts]], x86 development is considered a niche industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. Chips made in this area are primarily for domestic consumption, as they cannot likely be exported due to litigation and lack competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

For China, ARM is the dominant force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. An estimated 95% of computer chips designed in China are ARM-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. Furthermore, if not ARM, the focus shifts to RISC-V <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. The development of RISC-V is supported by major players like Alibaba Cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>, and HiSilicon has notably released its first RISC-V chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

Despite the activity in domestic x86 chips, they still lag many years behind their American-made counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. This suggests that ARM and RISC-V represent the more significant and strategic directions for [[future_prospects_for_chinese_semiconductor_manufacturing | China's future prospects for Chinese semiconductor manufacturing]] in achieving self-sufficiency and technological advancement.

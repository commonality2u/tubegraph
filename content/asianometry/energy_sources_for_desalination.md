Desalination, the process of removing salts from salty sea and brackish water to produce fresh water, is an energy-intensive process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Historically, these processes have often been powered by burning fossil fuels like oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. However, the considerable environmental damage caused by burning fossil fuels has led to the exploration of alternative energy sources, notably [[nuclear_energy_in_desalination | nuclear energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Energy Consumption by Desalination Technologies

Different [[desalination_technologies_and_processes | desalination technologies]] have varying energy demands:

*   **Thermal Processes (MSF and MED)**: [[desalination_technologies_msf_and_reverse_osmosis | Multi-stage flash (MSF)]] and [[desalination_technologies_msf_and_reverse_osmosis | multi-effect distillation (MED)]] are thermal processes that use heat to evaporate seawater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. These methods typically require about 10 to 15 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per cubic meter of water produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. While highly scalable and reliable, and not requiring pre-treatment like RO, energy efficiency tends to be a secondary concern in regions with abundant energy, such as the Gulf countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Reverse Osmosis (RO)**: [[desalination_technologies_msf_and_reverse_osmosis | Reverse osmosis (RO)]] is a membrane-based technology that uses electricity to push salt water through semi-permeable membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. RO processes, excluding pre-processing costs, are more energy efficient, requiring about 5 kWh per cubic meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This efficiency has contributed to its faster recent adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## [[nuclear_energy_in_desalination | Nuclear Energy]] as an Alternative

Given the energy intensity of desalination, [[nuclear_energy_in_desalination | nuclear energy]] has been explored as a viable, stable, and cleaner alternative to fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Integration with Desalination Processes
Most existing [[nuclear_energy_in_desalination | nuclear desalination]] systems cogenerate power and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

*   **For Reverse Osmosis (RO)**: [[nuclear_energy_in_desalination | Nuclear power plants]] generate electricity that directly powers the RO process, which is relatively straightforward due to RO's energy efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **For Thermal Processes**: The nuclear reactor generates steam, which first goes into a turbine for electricity generation. The remaining steam is then routed to a heat exchanger to heat salt water for the desalination process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

Many nuclear power plants are already located near saltwater sources for cooling, making cogeneration an economically attractive option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### Economic and Environmental Considerations
While [[economic_considerations_of_desalination | nuclear energy's capital costs]] are higher due to upfront construction expenses, its operating cost is very stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The cost of uranium fuel has little impact on water costs, unlike the volatility seen with oil prices, where doubling oil costs can raise water costs by 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

From an environmental standpoint, [[nuclear_energy_in_desalination | nuclear desalination]] appears to be environmentally benign, primarily because it avoids burning fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. While concerns like tritium contamination exist, engineers implement multiple barriers and pressure differentials to ensure desalinated water tritium levels remain below international and country-mandated regulatory limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Global Projects and Examples
Several countries have explored or implemented [[nuclear_energy_in_desalination | nuclear desalination]]:

*   **Kazakhstan**: In 1973, a sodium-cooled BN350 reactor provided electricity and nuclear heat to a desalination plant on the Caspian Sea, complementing a traditional coal-fired power plant. It generated 40,000 cubic meters of water a day for its lifetime until decommissioning in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Japan**: Commissioned its first [[nuclear_energy_in_desalination | nuclear desalination]] plant with the Ohi Nuclear Power Station in 1978, capable of generating 1,300 cubic meters of potable water daily. Japan has since added nine more such plants, many still in operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Other Countries**: Pakistan, India, and China have also commissioned [[nuclear_energy_in_desalination | nuclear desalination]] plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   **China**: With significant [[water_scarcity_and_desalination_in_the_gulf_region | water scarcity concerns]], China's first commercial [[nuclear_energy_in_desalination | nuclear desalination]] project was at the Hongyanghu nuclear power plant, generating 10,000 cubic meters a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
    *   **South Korea**: Has integrated desalination capacity into its SMART reactor, producing 40,000 cubic meters of water a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
    *   **Russia**: Has explored adding desalination capacities to their floating nuclear power plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Future Outlook
While solar and wind power desalination projects are advancing, [[nuclear_energy_in_desalination | nuclear desalination]] offers reliably high amounts of potable water at a low operating cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. It can support [[trends_in_desalination_and_energy_consumption | water-led growth]] for societies, allow for more water-intensive agriculture, reduce conflicts over limited surface waters, and prevent the burning of fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. The cost-benefit calculations of [[nuclear_energy_in_desalination | nuclear desalination]] are substantial and warrant further exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

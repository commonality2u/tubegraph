The x86 instruction set architecture (ISA) is foundational to many modern computing devices, with Intel and AMD being the primary developers and sellers of chips utilizing this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In 2020, Intel sold $20 billion worth of processors to China, while AMD sold $2.3 billion, figures comparable to or higher than their sales in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Recognizing China as a massive market, Chinese companies have become interested in developing their own [[chinas_interest_in_homegrown_x86_processors | homegrown x86 processors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Understanding X86

X86 refers to a family of instruction set architectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. A chip design company implements an instruction set like x86 or ARM to create a CPU microarchitecture, which then leads to a family of chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Different companies can share instruction sets but still produce radically different designs; for example, Intel's and AMD's x86 implementations perform differently despite using the same instruction set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Intel first developed and popularized x86, but licensed it to other companies for second-source and anti-competitive reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. AMD is the most famous of these companies, holding a core license that has been the subject of numerous legal battles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. In contrast, ARM licenses its intellectual property (IP) to other companies, which then make and sell their own chips, often for smartphones and IoT gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

As of today, most CPUs for PCs, game consoles, and servers are x86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. They are known for handling compute-intensive tasks and power 481 of the world's top 500 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. X86 technology is a prominent example of an American technology that has become a global standard, which presents a challenge for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## China's Motivation for Domestic Alternatives

China has long been interested in developing domestic alternatives to American technologies, a push that has intensified recently for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>:

*   **Edward Snowden Revelations:** Revelations about American spying on foreign allies and competitors raised alarms globally, leading countries to scrutinize the implementation of American technologies in critical use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Increasing Competition:** The recognition of heightened competition between China and the United States has led to increased tensions, marking a shift from a previous era of openness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **National Champions:** China desires to have homegrown national champions in critical industries such as high-speed rail, solar, space, and now, computer chips, viewing it as a point of national pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **US Sanctions:** The Trump administration's decision to cut off Chinese national champions like Huawei from access to American technologies reinforced China's fears, spurring its drive for domestic self-sufficiency in x86 chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Chinese X86 Chip Lineages

There are two distinct lineages of homegrown x86 chips available in the Chinese market: Zaoshin and Haigong, each owing their existence to different circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Zaoshin

Zaoshin is the older of the two lineages, releasing CPUs since 2014 and marketing them as domestically made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. It is a fabless semiconductor joint venture between the Shanghai municipal government and a Taiwanese company called Via Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

Via Technologies is one of the rare companies with an x86 architectural license, which it acquired through the 1999 purchases of Cyrix and Centaur Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Via's acquisition of Centaur led to a prolonged patent battle with Intel, which concluded with a 10-year cross-license agreement in 2003, extended by a three-year grace period in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Zaoshin architectures are direct descendants of Centaur Technologies' work, with their sixth-generation Luchajoy chips being about four to eight years behind the latest American designs in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. They consume less power than traditional desktop chips, reflecting their mobile and IoT roots, making them suitable for China's low-end needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Zaoshin, being a fabless company, has historically used TSMC for fabrication but is trying to switch to a mainland alternative like SMIC for national security reasons, which is causing delays and performance loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Zaoshin has also announced plans to enter the discrete GPU space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Haigong (AMD Joint Venture)

The second Chinese x86 joint venture initiative came at the behest of AMD, another major x86 license holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. In 2015, when AMD was in a financially vulnerable position, it formed a joint venture to provide the Chinese market with a version of its Zen 1 x86 chips, intended to be considered "Chinese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

AMD structured this joint venture to control its valuable IP while allowing the Chinese to claim the chips as homegrown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This was done through a complex two-layer joint venture collectively called Tianjin Hai Guang Advanced Technology Investment Co-Limited (THATIC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Chinese partners include the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other private and public organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

The structure involved:
1.  **Hai Guang Micro Electronics (HMC):** 51% owned by AMD, receiving IP for special x86 server chips from AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. HMC removes sensitive elements of the chip design.
2.  **Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit Design Company (Haikong):** AMD owns only 30% of Haikong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Haikong makes changes and updates, including designing the top-level architecture.

The chip design then goes back to HMC/AMD for approval and finishing, before being sent to GlobalFoundries for fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. After fabrication, chips are given to Haikong for packaging and sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

AMD stated that it briefed the US Departments of Defense and Commerce and received a green light for the venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. However, the Department of Defense reportedly did not agree with the Treasury Department's ultimate approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. While AMD claimed the chips would be for commercial purposes, job postings and interviews in China suggested their use in new exa-scale supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. The complexity of the system, while designed to grant China a "PR headline," could also make inadvertent technology transfers difficult to detect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

In 2019, THATIC was placed on an entity list, and AMD agreed to cease further technology transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. While THATIC still holds the original IP, AMD has since moved on to selling its fourth-generation Zen 3 chips, which are superior and readily available to Chinese consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Some believe the design would be difficult to reverse-engineer or port to other foundries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Future of X86 in China

X86 still holds a strong place in the tech community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Intel's announcement of potentially opening up x86 IP to foundry customers through its Foundry 2.0 initiative raises questions about whether Chinese fabless companies might be allowed to create x86 chips using Intel's services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Given the perceived value of x86 and the importance of technology transfer for national catch-up strategies in Asia, Americans naturally view these Chinese x86 chips with some alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

However, the dominance of x86 is not as absolute as it once was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. ARM is gaining significant traction in areas once exclusive to x86, including desktops and servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

Furthermore, within [[developments_in_chinas_domestic_semiconductor_ecosystem | China's indigenous semiconductor efforts]], x86 development is a niche industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Whatever Chinese companies produce in this area is primarily for domestic consumption, as these chips cannot likely be exported due to potential litigation and are not competitive anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. In China, ARM is the dominant architecture, with an estimated 95% of computer chips designed in the country being ARM-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. If not ARM, the focus is on RISC-V, an open-source instruction set backed by major players like Alibaba Cloud and HiSilicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

In conclusion, while Chinese x86 chips are interesting, they still lag many years behind their American competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Their impact is unlikely to be massive as long as [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | Intel and AMD's chips]] remain available in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

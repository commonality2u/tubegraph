On October 16, 1964, at 3 P.M., the People's Republic of China (PRC) detonated its first domestically produced atomic bomb, becoming one of the five Atomic Powers, joining the United States, Soviet Union, and Great Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. China achieved this feat in less than five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## China's Motivation for Nuclear Development

Following America's sole possession of the atomic bomb, Mao Zedong and the party leadership feared potential American nuclear intervention in the Chinese Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. During his December 1949 visit to Stalin to negotiate China's entry into the Soviet Bloc, Mao sought the assurance of a nuclear umbrella over his country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The Soviets, who had recently broken the Western nuclear monopoly, were reluctant to explicitly grant this protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

The original Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance stated that in the event of an invasion, the other signatory country would "render assistance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Zhou Enlai suggested adding the clause "with all means at its disposal," which was eventually accepted despite initial Soviet resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. However, no formal writing ever explicitly mentioned nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

These assurances were tested during the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. As American forces neared the Yalu River, China feared an invasion and potential American use of the atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. China intervened, believing in their manpower advantage and that the U.S. would not risk all-out nuclear warfare with the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Mao's gamble paid off, and the U.S. did not use nuclear weapons, though they threatened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

After the Korean War, American threats of nuclear retaliation, termed "nuclear blackmail" by Chinese leadership, had a strong impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Statements by figures like Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and General Curtis LeMay of the Strategic Air Command, who suggested bombing targets in China, heightened these fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. During the First Taiwan Strait Crisis (late 1954-1955), U.S. military leadership recommended using nuclear weapons, though President Eisenhower ultimately refrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The U.S.-Republic of China mutual defense treaty in December 1954 further convinced the Communists that the Kuomintang (Gomidan) would be emboldened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. While China likely would have pursued an atomic weapon anyway, these crises lent the process special urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Initial Sino-Soviet Cooperation (Peaceful Atomic Energy)

China initially turned to the Soviets, their largest external trading partner, who had provided loans and assisted in Soviet-style industrial development and military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. While the PRC knew about the Soviet nuclear program, Stalin was unwilling to transfer atomic technology during his lifetime, offering only the "protection" of their nuclear umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

Following Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev became the leader of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Khrushchev sought Chinese support to boost his domestic influence and de-Stalinization efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In October 1954, during a meeting in the PRC, Mao asked Khrushchev for assistance in China's nuclear weapons program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Khrushchev, initially surprised, tried to dissuade China, advocating focus on economic development and reiterating the nuclear umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The Chinese insisted, and the Soviets eventually agreed to cooperate on items for peaceful atomic energy use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

In April 1955, the Sino-Soviet Atomic Cooperation Treaty was signed, with the Soviets agreeing to provide an experimental nuclear power plant and a cyclotron at a cost of 430 million rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. A Soviet team of nuclear experts, led by the head of the Soviet Institute of Nuclear Physics, visited China, showing films, lecturing to [[chinese_scientists_contributions_to_nuclear_development | 1,400 Chinese scientists]] including Zhou Enlai, and exploring uranium reserves in Xinjiang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Any useful uranium would primarily serve Chinese domestic purposes, with surplus exported to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. In February 1956, Khrushchev expanded cooperation, sending more Chinese students to the Soviet Union and aiding in building nuclear research facilities for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

Despite these advances, Mao and his colleagues viewed the relationship as an "alliance of convenience," expecting it to end and thus aiming to maximize knowledge transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. China significantly increased its science research funding from $15 million in 1955 to $100 million in 1956, with a large portion going to the Chinese Academy of Sciences to purchase Western science literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Contributions of Chinese Scientists

The Chinese nuclear program actively sought and benefited from top [[chinese_scientists_contributions_to_nuclear_development | Chinese scientists]], particularly those educated or who worked in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

Key figures included:
*   **Dr. Qian Xuesen (Tsien Hsue-shen)**: Co-founded the Jet Propulsion Lab, returned to China after controversial accusations of communist sympathies in the U.S., which was a "boon for the PRC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Chen Weitong, Chen San-chang, and Peng Huanwu**: Other notable expatriate scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Peng Huanwu**: A quantum physicist with two doctorates, the first Chinese student of Nobel laureate Max Born, who studied uranium fission and gamma rays at The Curie Institute in Paris before directing the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

These scientists, despite their patriotism, faced unfair attacks from far-left elements of the Communist Party for being "rightist intellectuals," leading Zhou Enlai to convene a meeting in 1956 to end the persecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. They found peace primarily after being moved to remote locations away from cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Shifting to Military Cooperation and Challenges

Up until 1957, Soviet transfers were helpful for accelerating peaceful atomic energy reactor design, though China already possessed much of this knowledge from published Western literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. However, nuclear weapons required specialized techniques and extensive infrastructure, which the Soviets had resisted sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

A turning point occurred in late October 1956 with anti-communist protests in Hungary and Poland, which the Soviets violently repressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Weakened, the Soviets needed the backing of their primary foreign ally, China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Consequently, in 1957, against military advice and that of Ivan Kurchatov (father of the Soviet Atomic program), Khrushchev decided to transfer atomic bomb technology to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

In October 1957, China and the Soviets signed an agreement for the "production of new weapons and military technology equipment and establishment of a comprehensive atomic energy industry in China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This agreement promised a "teaching model atomic bomb" with designs and documentation, as well as technology for casings, uranium and plutonium processing, and testing guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

### Ambiguity of Technology Transfer

The extent to which [[role_of_soviet_technology_transfer_in_chinas_nuclear_development | Soviet technology transfer]] truly aided China's nuclear weapons program remains a subject of debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Khrushchev claimed they shared "almost everything," keeping "no secrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. However, Soviet scientists were instructed to limit disclosures without being explicitly told the limits, leading to passive information sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

The Chinese were largely unimpressed with the nuclear weapons design specifics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. A Soviet lecture on July 15, 1958, covered theory, structure, and assembly of a nuclear weapon, but provided no documents, only a basic blackboard sketch to an audience mostly of administrative personnel, not scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. No parameters or formulas were given, and notes were not allowed, with the explanation that this would come with the sample teaching bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The Chinese later claimed the 1958 lecture contained "completely wrong data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Dr. Chen San-chang, already familiar with nuclear weapon concepts from his time in the U.S., noted the information was similar to what was publicly available in capitalist countries, "but with a few more details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. These conflicting accounts are complicated by the later Sino-Soviet split, as both sides had incentives to either exaggerate or downplay their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

Despite these specific criticisms, the overall [[role_of_soviet_technology_transfer_in_chinas_nuclear_development | scale of technology transferred]] in other areas, such as prospecting and mining for uranium, was massive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. The Soviets assisted with aerial surveys and prospecting labs, though China still claimed Soviet guidance was unhelpful for locating their best uranium deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Critically, the Soviets also provided their R-12 intercontinental ballistic missile designs, which the Chinese received for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. This period of deep military technology cooperation lasted from 1957 to 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

## Sino-Soviet Split and Withdrawal of Aid

The Sino-Soviet split, a complex process, showed early signs of trouble in 1956 with Khrushchev's secret speech criticizing Stalin, which infuriated Mao Zedong, who saw it as an indirect attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. In November 1957, at the Moscow Conference of world Communists, Mao's cavalier comments about half of humanity dying in a nuclear war, with the remaining half building socialism, alarmed the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

Mao's comments, made just a month after the 1957 agreement, led the Soviet leadership to renege on delivering the "teaching bomb prototype" in early 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Khrushchev cited deteriorating relations and internal security concerns for the indefinite postponement of the bomb transfer, stating it would "strain relations with the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

The Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958, initiated by Mao, further exacerbated tensions, with the confrontation threatening nuclear war again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. Khrushchev realized his "horrible mistake" and in June 1959, informed China of the termination of military cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Soviet military advisers were recalled, with the last one leaving by July 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Ultimately, 40% of the promised equipment and raw materials never arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Of 30 Sino-Soviet nuclear industry projects, only a minority were completed, and nine were shut down entirely, forcing China to restart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Chinese leadership interpreted this as a deliberate Soviet attempt to maintain a technical gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

## China's Indigenous Nuclear Program

The withdrawal of Soviet aid, though a blow, fueled China's resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. In January 1960, China launched the "596 project," named to commemorate the "shameful date" of the Soviet withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Zhou Enlai declared they would achieve a breakthrough in three years, master technical know-how in five, and have a stockpile of bombs in eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

Amidst the economic and social pressures of the Great Leap Forward, China abandoned the "dual track" approach (using both uranium-235 and plutonium) and focused solely on the uranium-235 design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

The last Soviet advisers left the Lanzo gaseous diffusion plant in July 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Plant leader Wang Jie was instrumental in organizing technicians to source tens of thousands of raw materials and supplies across China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Despite the challenges, including technicians disassembling Soviet-provided equipment in the name of "technological innovation" and severe food shortages during the Great Leap Forward, progress continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. By the end of 1961, 700 days after the Soviet severance, the Lanzo plant's machinery was successfully installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The Chinese found substitutes for many Soviet components, including a special lubricant for gaseous diffusion pumps that Soviet advisers had taken with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. By mid-1963, Lanzo scientists were successfully isolating uranium-235, reaching 90% enrichment by January 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

### Bomb Design and Production

A 1950s-style nuclear bomb relies on mashing fissile material into super-criticality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. China opted for an implosion design using uranium-235, which required less fissile material than a gun-type design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. The key challenge was synchronizing high explosives to prevent a premature neutron burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. Unlike the [[economic_and_technical_challenges_in_british_nuclear_energy | British nuclear weapons program]] which benefited from scientists working at Los Alamos, China lacked such direct access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

By 1960, when the Soviets left, China had completed theoretical work and began actual design, aided by some "sloppy shredding" of critical papers by the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. Working in Beijing, a team used hand calculators for complex equations and simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. By late 1962, they mastered implosion theory, and a year later, finalized the implosion mechanism design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. In late 1963, the enriched uranium arrived at the manufacturing plant in Subei, Gansu Province, where craftsmen machined it into a ball and assembled the "596 bomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

## International Reactions and Costs

China's successful nuclear test caught both the Americans and Soviets by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. The U.S. government, aware of China's program since 1959, considered intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. President Kennedy expressed concern that a nuclear China would lead to Southeast Asia falling to Communists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. Kennedy explored military intervention with Khrushchev in the early 1960s, but Khrushchev never embraced the idea, and some Kennedy administration members pushed against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

China's choice of an implosion-type bomb using uranium rather than plutonium confused American spymasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. While they knew about the Lanzo gaseous diffusion plant, they mistakenly believed it was too small for a real nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. The U.S. underestimated China's nuclear effort, realizing their mistake only on the eve of the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

China's indigenous nuclear bomb program was a massive undertaking, involving hundreds of thousands of people, over 900 factories, research institutes, and schools across 20 provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. It cost an estimated 10.7 billion RMB (4.1 billion USD in 1957 prices) over 10 years, a staggering amount for an undeveloped nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. Much of these costs came during the economically difficult years of the Great Leap Forward and early 1960s, forcing cuts in other government projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

Scholarly debate continues regarding the extent of [[role_of_soviet_technology_transfer_in_chinas_nuclear_development | Soviet technology transfer]]'s benefit to the Chinese program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. Deng Xiaoping told the Romanian Ambassador in 1966 that China would not have built the bombs so fast if the Soviets hadn't broken the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. While the Soviets provided significant aid, their withdrawal spurred China to finish the job independently, highlighting the [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_Chinas_nuclear_program | impact of geopolitical tensions on China's nuclear program]] and the nation's determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.

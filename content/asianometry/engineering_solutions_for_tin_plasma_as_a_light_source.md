After over 20 years of development, [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography]] ([[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]]) has become a commercial reality, with multi-million dollar machines from ASML using [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] light to create minuscule patterns in wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The heart of ASML's $150 million lithography machine is its [[ASMLs EUV Light Source and Laser Mechanics | EUV light source]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This system involves lasers firing pulses at tin droplets to generate powerful 13.5 nanometer wavelength light for microprocessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This article primarily focuses on the [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] approach taken by Cymer, an ASML subsidiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Requirements for [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] Light Sources
Scientists and engineers identified two major requirements for the next generation of [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] light sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>:

1.  **High Conversion Efficiency**: The source must generate sufficient [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] light at the correct 13.5 nanometer wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, emitted in the right direction (towards the light collector optics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. This process also needs to be relatively efficient, avoiding obscene amounts of energy input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
2.  **Debris Mitigation**: Firing lasers at targets creates a lot of debris that can contaminate the critical optic system and degrade performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. A method to mitigate this debris is essential to meet cost of ownership requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

These two seemingly simple issues proved incredibly difficult to overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

## Early Experiments and Shifting Goalposts
Early experiments in [[Japans semiconductor industry and EUV | Japan]] (1986) and Bell Labs (1990) used synchrotron radiation to etch patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>, achieving 500 nanometer and 50 nanometer half-pitch prints respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. However, synchrotrons were impractical for industrial use because they emitted [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | UV]] light over too broad a field of view, failing the first big requirement for conversion efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

The initial target for [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] was the 100 nanometer node, but delays led it to be penciled in for the 70 nanometer, then 50 nanometer nodes, and even further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. This significantly impacted the design, requiring Carl Zeiss, the German optics maker, to add more mirrors to the optical systems to increase print resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. Each mirror, even if perfectly made, reflects at most around 70% of the [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. To compensate, ASML needed a stronger, more brilliant point of plasma light, capable of at least 250 watts, to be competitive with existing 193 nanometer laser technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

## Laser Produced Plasma (LPP) and Target Material Selection
Researchers explored Laser Produced Plasma (LPP), where a laser points at a target to create plasma that emits [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | UV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. The primary concern was debris from the target contaminating the optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. Three main target materials were investigated: lithium, tin, and xenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

*   **Xenon**: Initially promising, using rare xenon gas (gaseous or ice form) with YAG lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. Sandia Laboratory successfully suppressed xenon ice particles with a gas jet, but the plasma emitted high-energy ions that still degraded optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. Furthermore, xenon suffered from a fundamental roadblock: very low conversion efficiency (less than one percent), limiting it to only several tens of watts of [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.
*   **Tin**: Tin plasma emits a lot of [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | UV]] light at the required wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. However, firing lasers at a tin plate resulted in terrible conversion efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. More significantly, tin notoriously generated a lot of tin debris, with a 1.2 nanometer thick tin layer causing a 20% decline in collector efficiency and a 10% decline in total tool output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

Despite the debris issue, in 2002, leading minds in the industry convened and decided to pivot towards tin plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. They recognized that while tin presented a "debris nightmare" on the development roadmap, it had no fundamental physics issues that engineering could not overcome, unlike xenon's inherent low conversion efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

### Optimizing Conversion Efficiency: From Plate to Droplet
The initial tin plate target had a very low spectral efficiency (around one percent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. The plasma formed on a flat tin plate was too opaque, blocking 13.5 nanometer wavelength light from reaching the mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

The solution involved changing the target shape. Companies had already begun experimenting with firing lasers at tin droplets instead of plates, yielding good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. To increase spectral efficiency, a more concave shape was proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

The ultimate solution to achieve both a concave shape and minimal target size involved a two-shot laser process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>:

1.  **Pre-pulse Laser**: A low-energy laser pulse hits the tin droplet, creating strong pressure waves that reshape the spherical droplet into a concave sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. Precision is crucial; an incorrect hit can tilt the sheet or reflect the main pulse back at the laser machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.
2.  **Main Pulse Laser**: An amplified carbon dioxide (CO2) laser, operating at a 10 micrometer wavelength, delivers a more powerful blast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. This remakes the droplet into an acorn shape and vaporizes it, creating the dense plasma that emits the desired 13.5 nanometer light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. This plasma is hotter and denser than lightning-created plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.

The introduction of the pre-pulse laser in 2016, combined with more powerful CO2 lasers, allowed ASML and Cymer to drastically scale up [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] light source power levels from 10 watts to over 200 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. The final conversion efficiency from this setup is six percent, a massive improvement from the one percent of early YAG laser experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>. This enabled ASML's [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] machines to achieve the stable 250-watt power level needed for 125 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>, with a pathway to 450 watts in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.

### Mitigating Debris and System Components
The two-shot laser process targets tin droplets shot into a vacuum vessel at 50,000 cycles per second (50 kilohertz) at a speed of 80 meters per second (288 kilometers per hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>. This high speed ensures a large separation (1.6 millimeters) between each 30 micrometer wide droplet, preventing plasma interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.

Key components of the system include:
*   **High-powered CO2 laser**: Consisting of a master oscillator and a power amplifier (MOPA), reaching over 20 kilowatts and often installed beneath the fab clean room floor due to its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.
*   **Beam transport system**: Handles laser focusing and positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.
*   **Vacuum vessel**: Filled with low-pressure hydrogen gas, housing the droplet generator, metrology modules, and the [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] collector mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.

To protect the collector mirror from over 100 billion pulses (30,000 hours of lifetime) and debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>, Zeiss and ASML adopted a critical solution: pumping hydrogen into the vacuum chamber as a buffer gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. The hydrogen gas cools the plasma, blocks a percentage of tin ions, and etches layers of tin from the mirror surface, ensuring the longevity of the bilayer collector mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.

## The Approach to [[Challenges in developing EUV systems | EUV]] Development
The [[Challenges and potential of high NA EUV technology | development of EUV]] differs significantly from earlier lithography technologies like 193 nanometer Argon Fluoride lasers. While previous generations allowed for extensive trial-and-error experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>, [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] demanded a deep theoretical understanding of physics and fundamental dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>. Engineers first calculated exact parameters like opacity, temperature, droplet size, and ion density years in advance, then built machines to precisely achieve these in real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>. This scientific, rather than purely empirical, approach was necessary to overcome the thorny energy efficiency and debris mitigation issues while meeting commercial requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.

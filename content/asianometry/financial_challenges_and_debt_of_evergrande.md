Evergrande Group, a sprawling company, has recently faced significant financial challenges, accumulating billions of dollars in debt and experiencing a cash crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. As of a recent report, the company holds $300 billion in liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The ongoing situation has raised interest in how a real estate company grew so large and rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Early Financial Strategy: "Three Highs, One Low"

Evergrande's early growth strategy, known as *san gao yidi* (literally "three highs, one low"), relied heavily on debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **High Debt, High Leverage, High Turnover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
*   **Low Cost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>

This approach meant the company was constantly "teetering on a razor's edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. However, without this debt, Evergrande could not acquire its massive land bank, which was the country's fastest appreciating asset at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Nature of Liabilities
It's important to note that Evergrande's liabilities encompass more than just traditional borrowings like bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. A significant portion comes from customer deposits â€“ down payments for future homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Unlike bank deposits, which are often insured, customer deposits for future homes carry a much higher risk of forced withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Furthermore, over 50% of Evergrande's debt is classified as current, meaning it could be called upon for repayment within a year or an operating cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This contrasts sharply with a major bank like JPMorgan Chase, which has a comparatively small amount of current liabilities relative to its total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Impact of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis
The 2008 global financial crisis raised fears of a real estate crisis in China, putting Evergrande in turbulent waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. At the time, the company was in the midst of a national expansion, spending heavily to acquire land in China's first and second-tier cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Its land bank had grown ninefold since 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. With 37 projects in development, Evergrande faced cash flow problems and owed approximately 12 to 15 billion RMB (about $2 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Evergrande's initial plan to pay off this debt by going public on the Hong Kong stock exchange was thwarted by the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Desperate, founder Xu Jiayin secured an investment of over $150 million USD from Cheong Yu-tung of Chao Tai Fook Group, as the lead investor in a $500 million USD pre-IPO investment round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Other investors included Deutsche Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and the Kuwait Investment Authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This capital infusion helped stabilize the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

In November 2009, Evergrande's IPO in Hong Kong proceeded, with shares rising 34% on the first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. By the end of 2009, Evergrande had total assets of 63 billion RMB ($9.8 billion USD) and total liabilities of 50 billion RMB ($7.8 billion USD), still operating on a "razor's edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

## Diversification and Financial Strain
Xu Jiayin aimed to build an empire, leading to Evergrande's diversification beyond real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

*   **Football Club**: In 2010, Evergrande acquired the Guangzhou football club for 100 million RMB ($15 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Consumer Goods (Mineral Water)**: In 2013, Evergrande entered the consumer goods industry with its "Evergrande Ice Spring" mineral water, setting ambitious sales targets of 10 billion RMB ($1.5 billion USD) in 2014 and 30 billion RMB ($4.6 billion USD) by 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. However, the brand struggled and was not profitable, despite high gross margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. In 2016, Evergrande sold its mineral water business and other food products for 2.7 billion RMB ($405 million), including 3.3 billion RMB ($510 million USD) in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **Plastic Surgery**: In mid-2014, Evergrande acquired Yen-chen plastic surgery, a chain of clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **New Energy Vehicles (NEVs)**: In 2018, Evergrande announced its entry into the high-tech industry, including new energy vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. In November 2019, they committed 45 billion RMB ($7 billion USD) over three years to EV development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. They rebranded a health company they owned, Evergrande Health Industry Group, to Evergrande Auto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. In August 2020, Evergrande Auto unveiled six vehicles under its Hangqi brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. They raised $500 million USD from investors like Tencent, Didi, and Jack Ma's Infen Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. By April 2021, Evergrande Auto was valued at nearly $90 billion, more than Ford Motors, despite not having sold a single car and losing billions of RMB annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. This valuation was considered a bubble, and the stock eventually crashed by over 95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

## 2017 Strategy Reversal: "Three Lows, One High"
In early 2017, Xu Jiayin announced a reversal of Evergrande's business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. At this time, the company's total liabilities had reached 1.15 trillion RMB ($178 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. The new strategy, *sandi yigao* (three lows, one high), aimed for:
*   **Low Debt, Low Leverage, Low Cost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>
*   **High Turnover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>

The goal was to lower debt ratios and increase total net assets, aligning with the Chinese government's efforts to deleverage the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Despite reported net profits rising by 110% to 37 billion RMB ($5.7 billion USD) by the end of 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, total liabilities *actually rose* from 1.1 trillion RMB ($170 billion USD) in 2016 to 1.5 trillion RMB ($232 billion USD) in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. Total borrowings also increased from 532 billion RMB ($82 billion USD) to $113 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

## Government Relations and Influence
Xu Jiayin has maintained close ties to the Chinese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, being China's single most generous individual in terms of charity, winning the China Charity Award for eight years consecutively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. In 2018 and 2019, he donated an estimated 4 billion RMB ($620 million USD) in cash each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. These ties were evident when Andrew Left of Citron Research published a report in June 2012 claiming Evergrande was insolvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Hong Kong authorities launched a years-long civil case against Left, banning him from trading in Hong Kong for five years in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Left lost his final appeal in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

## "Three Red Lines" Policy
In August 2020, the Chinese government, concerned about contagion threats in its financial sector from massive conglomerates funded by borrowed money, introduced regulations mandating "three red lines" for real estate companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. Companies failing these requirements would be barred from adding more debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.

The "three red lines" are:
1.  A percentage ceiling on the ratio of liabilities to assets of 70% (excluding advances from contracted projects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
2.  A cap on the percentage of net debt to equity of 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
3.  A requirement to hold at least one dollar of cash for each dollar borrowed in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

Evergrande's metrics at the time the law passed were significantly beyond these limits:
*   Liabilities to asset ratio: 82% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>
*   Net debt to equity: 199% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>
*   Cash to short-term borrowings: 0.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>

This caught the company off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. In response, Xu Jiayin announced a 30% price slash on its 600 new builds nationwide, aiming for 100 billion RMB ($15.4 billion USD) in monthly sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

## September 2020 Leaked Letter
In September 2020, a Chinese website leaked a letter from Evergrande to the Guangdong provincial government titled "Report on requesting support for major asset restructuring projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. While Evergrande denied its authenticity, the market believed it to be real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. The letter casually stated that the company's interest-bearing liabilities had reached about 835 billion RMB ($130 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. This included:
*   232 billion RMB ($35.8 billion USD) owed to 128 domestic banks, with Minsheng Bank and Agricultural Bank of China being the largest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.
*   368 billion RMB ($56.9 billion USD) owed to 121 non-banking entities, such as real estate funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.
*   The remainder owed to various domestic and offshore bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.

The report requested the Guangdong government's help in coordinating a reorganization of Evergrande's entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. Crucially, if the reorganization was not completed before February 2021, Evergrande would need to pay strategic investors 130 billion RMB ($20 billion USD) and 13.7 billion RMB ($2.2 billion USD) in dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. This threatened a sudden cash flow crunch and risked the company's financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.

## Current Financial State and Outlook
Since the leaked letter, Evergrande has experienced debt downgrades, with shares dropping over 68% and debt losing over half its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. Evergrande's 2020 annual report showed approximately 1.95 trillion RMB (about $300 billion USD) in liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. While the company has assets (1.9 trillion RMB worth), much of it is in land bank assets or houses under construction, which are not easily monetized without paying vendors and construction crews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

### Evergrande Wealth Management
Another concern is the obligations from Evergrande Wealth Management fund products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. These high-yielding interest products, largely sold to employees who then resell them to friends and family, amount to about 40 billion RMB ($6.2 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>. On September 8, 2021, two affiliates missed repayments, leading to protests at Evergrande's headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>. Five days later, Evergrande announced repayment options including cash (with a waiting period), payment in kind (land), or credit for future home purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

### Off-Balance Sheet Issues
Evergrande also faces issues with off-balance sheet subsidiaries, which the main group does not own 51% of, but whose debts are backed by the main group through unspoken agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. The full extent of these liabilities is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

### Leadership Change and Future
Amidst the turmoil, Xu Jiayin resigned as Evergrande's chairman on August 17, 2021, with Zhao Tanglong stepping up as chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

It is speculated that the government will not bail out Evergrande like a bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. The company is expected to go to court for debt resolution and be slowly broken up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. There are concerns about the [[impact_and_consequences_of_evergrandes_financial_issues | effect of Evergrande's winding down on its hundreds of new builds and the real estate markets across China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. However, lower real estate prices might align with the government's social equality goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. Non-performing real estate loans remain low across the overall financial system, suggesting capacity to absorb losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. The larger question is whether regulators can fence off the damage from off-balance sheet issues before it causes a systemic crisis of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Regulators have previously handled other massive conglomerates in crisis, such as [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group | Anbang Insurance Group]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. The personal fate of Xu Jiayin, similar to figures like [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group | Wu Xiaohui of Anbang Insurance]] or Zhao Weiguo of Tsinghua Unigroup, remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.

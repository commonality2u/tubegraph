Europe today holds a minor position in the global semiconductor industry, accounting for a small percentage of chip design, fabrication, and assembly, despite being home to leading equipment and chemicals companies like ASML, STMicroelectronics, and Infineon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This current state was not inevitable, as Europeans independently invented the first transistor just months after the Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Early European Innovation and Squandered Leads

In 1948, mere months after Bell Labs created the first transistor in 1947, two scientists in Paris, Herbert Matera and Heinrich Welker, announced a similar invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Matera and Welker, who had studied semiconductor materials for the German radar program during World War II, resumed their research in Paris at a Westinghouse subsidiary after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. They developed what is now known as the point-contact transistor, conceptually similar to Bell Labs' invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

France's Secretary of Post, Telephones, and Telegraphs, Eugene Thomas, urged them to patent their device, which he named "transistron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. A press conference in May 1949 lauded the transistron's superiority to vacuum tubes, and patents were granted in the US (1951) and France (1952) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. By late 1949, Westinghouse had a factory in France producing tens of thousands of transistrons monthly for telephone systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Despite these early achievements, Europe's, particularly France's, optimistic lead was squandered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. By 1960, even Japan produced more transistors than France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Several factors contributed to this early lag:
*   **Government Priorities**: Shortly after the transistron's announcement, the French government decided to focus resources on developing nuclear technology, leaving the telecommunications industry to private enterprise without government funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Struggles**: French efforts consistently struggled with manufacturing in the early, unpredictable years of semiconductor production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Teams conservatively turned towards more abstract and theoretical research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Lack of Government-Business Initiatives**: There was a lack of joint initiatives to bring theoretical breakthroughs to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. French physicist Pierre Aigrain, a key figure in French semiconductor research, focused on theoretical space, and most of his students followed suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Underinvestment in R&D**: French businesses underinvested in R&D, with a 1940 survey finding less than a quarter of companies had in-house R&D labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The electronics industry continued to use outdated vacuum tube technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Transistorized French radios did not widely appear until around 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Economic Crises**: Economic and political crises in 1957-1958, partly due to the Algerian War, led to austerity policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The French transistor industry, 90% dependent on the government, lost funding for initiatives like transistorized television sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This led to reliance on imports and shrinking margins, impeding future investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

By the end of the 1950s, the French semiconductor industry had squandered its early research lead and fallen behind Japan and other European peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## The American Ascent: Military Demand and Disruptive Innovation

In contrast, the American semiconductor industry thrived due to several factors:
*   **Knowledge Dispersal**: Bell Labs widely dispersed early transistor production knowledge through open symposiums and liberal licensing, believing in spreading the innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Licensees, including Texas Instruments, contributed new innovations like the silicon junction transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Interdisciplinary Teams**: American teams, like the "Traitorous Eight" who co-founded Fairchild Semiconductor, were more interdisciplinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. William Shockley, a transistor inventor, deliberately recruited a group with diverse backgrounds in physics, mechanical engineering, and optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Hands-on Production**: Shockley encouraged scientists to handle technological processes themselves, fostering improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Dr. Jean Hoerni, one of the eight, developed the planar process, which allowed Fairchild to produce reliable transistors at high scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Military Demand**: The military played a critical role, buying half of the semiconductor industry's total output by the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Projects like the Minuteman 2 ICBM (1962) and the Apollo program (1961-1965) drove demand for higher-performing, smaller, reliable, and less power-hungry devices, forcing American firms to develop advanced techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This pushed them towards [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | more complex technologies]] like the Integrated Circuit (IC), jointly invented by Texas Instruments and Fairchild Semiconductor in 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Pricing**: Fairchild's Bob Noyce strategically sold ICs below manufacturing cost in 1964, betting on stimulating market demand, which proved successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Rise of Startups**: The US industry was "peppered with startups and spin-offs" like Shockley Semiconductor, Fairchild, Intel, and AMD, which produced semiconductors as an end product and innovated disruptive technologies, including mass-produced silicon planar transistors that obsoleted older alloy junction types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Microprocessor Era**: In 1971, Intel introduced the first microprocessor, the Intel 4004, ushering in an era of rapidly increasing complexity (Large-Scale Systems or LSI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. By 1969, computers overtook government and military as the leading demand driver for American ICs, further pushing for high-performance products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

## Japan's Catch-Up: Government Support and Strategic Adoption

Japan, starting from a position similar to France or Germany, rapidly adopted transistor technology and caught up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>:
*   **Consumer Electronics**: Products like Sony's transistor radio grew on domestic demand, encouraged by government promotion of radio and television adoption in the 1950s and 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Import Gating**: The Japanese government gated imports, allowing its domestic industry to build semiconductor manufacturing competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Mass Production**: Mass semiconductor production in Japan kicked off in 1955, growing 125 times in the latter half of the 1950s and matching American levels by 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Technology Licensing**: Japanese companies signed over 250 technology licensing agreements with foreign companies from 1952 to 1968, mastering these acquisitions and producing their own innovations by the mid-1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   **VLSI Project**: Despite falling behind the US in LSI systems by the early 1970s, Japan's political leadership launched the Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) project in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. This project budgeted hundreds of millions to unite computer makers and cooperatively develop next-generation VLSI technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. While it didn't achieve its one-chip computer goal, it helped Japanese semiconductor makers hone techniques for high transistor density, propelling them into a generational lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

## Europe's Persistent Challenges (1960s-1990s)

While the US and Japan advanced rapidly, Europe continued to struggle.
*   **Demand Focus**: European semiconductor demand in the 1960s came predominantly from the consumer sector (e.g., 56% in West Germany in 1963), which prioritized price over performance, unlike the military-driven US market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Vertical Integration and Technology Choices**: European electronics giants like Philips and Siemens were vertically integrated and viewed semiconductors as a component rather than a primary output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. They focused on evolutionary improvements to in-house transistor technologies, primarily germanium, believing silicon was only suitable for high-temperature applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This put them at a disadvantage as silicon became dominant.
*   **Lack of High-Performance Demand**: Europe lacked a strong source of demand for high-performance LSI devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. European computer companies were smaller than American ones, military/avionics demand was weak, and the telecom market was fragmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. This left consumer electronics companies, who sought different, less leading-edge chips, to absorb demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **Conservative Industrial Policy**: West German industrial policy was market-oriented and decentralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Funds, while substantial (e.g., $1.4 billion 1974-1979), were funneled through conservative large firms like Siemens (dubbed "a bank with an attached electronics department"), which lagged Americans by a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. The decline of AEG, another major German electronics company, further exacerbated the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.
*   **Limited Production Scale**: French chipmakers could not gain sufficient production scale to keep up with foreign competitors' aggressive cost-cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   **Technology Alliances**: European tech companies often struck technology alliances with American firms rather than other European companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. This contributed to a large and growing IT trade deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>.
*   **Ambitious but Insufficient Plans**:
    *   **French Microelectronics Plan (1982)**: Aimed to regain domestic market share with a large budget ($4.5 billion francs/year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. However, French investments (1.4% of world total in 1984) paled in comparison to the US and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.
    *   **West German R&D Program (1984) and Mega Project**: A billion Deutsche Marks over four years, including the high-profile Mega project for Siemens and Philips to develop advanced DRAM/SRAM chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. Siemens debuted its 4-megabit chip in 1987, a significant effort, but it relied on licensed technology from Toshiba, and the industry was moving too fast (Japan's NTT had a 16-megabit DRAM chip that same year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
    *   **Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative (JESSI) (1989)**: A €4 billion pan-European consortium, but it suffered from Philips pulling out of memory, ICL being acquired by Fujitsu, and Siemens allying with IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. Its budget also shrank, impairing its function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.
*   **Market Share Decline**: European producers' share of world semiconductor production plummeted from 60% in 1979 to 12% in 1985 and 10% in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. By 1991, European companies held less than 30% of their own market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.
*   **Intensified Competition (1990s)**: [[Generational shifts in semiconductor manufacturing | Technological and financial barriers]] to entry skyrocketed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. Competition intensified with the rise of Asian foundries like [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | TSMC]], which pioneered the independent foundry model, and Samsung, backed by its chaebol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.
*   **Disadvantaged Demand Structure**: Europe lost the consumer electronics space to Asian firms, military and government spending declined after the fall of the Soviet Union, and computing remained dominated by American firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. Europe's strong positions remained in specialty fields like industrial, telecommunications, and automotive, but these did not capture the majority of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

## Conclusion: A Compounded History

Europe's decline in semiconductors was not due to a single reason, but a situation that compounded over half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. While the US and Europe discovered transistor technology simultaneously, Europe fell behind due to political, technological, and production issues in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>. Strong American military spending and disruptive startups drove technological progress in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. In the 1970s, as US semiconductor competence grew, Europe focused on computers, disregarding semiconductors as a future focus, a mistake Japan did not make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. The 1980s and 1990s saw the rise of manufacturing outsourcing and the Asian supply chain intensify competition, relegating European manufacturers to specialty markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

Since 1990, Europe's market share in semiconductor production has remained around 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. While European governments and the EU have consistently been willing to financially support and promote their semiconductor industries, previous rounds of funding, R&D coordination, and forced consolidations have yet to reverse this long-standing trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. The [[eu_efforts_and_initiatives_to_revitalize_the_european_semiconductor_industry | EU Chips Act]] aims to double Europe's share to 20% by increasing high-end chip fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

Northeast England, once a center for heavy industry, faced significant economic challenges following the decline of these traditional sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This region struggled to identify its next growth industry, leaving its residents with the lowest median gross annual earnings in England and the highest proportion of the population claiming income support as of 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. By 1995, the unemployment rate in Northeast England was 9.1%, 50% higher than the rest of the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

In 1995, the prospect of a new semiconductor fabrication plant, or "fab," brought immense hope to the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Siemens Semiconductor pledged over a billion pounds for such a facility, a commitment that was met with widespread joy, even attracting a visit from the Queen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, this promising venture lasted only 15 months before Siemens closed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Northeast England's Economic Landscape

The [[historical_economic_challenges_in_northeast_england | historical economic challenges in Northeast England]] trace back to its long-standing dependence on heavy industries and rich coal mines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. After World War II, the British government nationalized the coal and steel industries, with the Ministry of Fuel and Power advocating against introducing new male-employing manufacturing industries to maximize output and employment in existing resource economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:02:05]</a>. This policy left the region dangerously reliant on these two industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

When de-industrialization began in the 1980s, Northeast England had few alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Tensions peaked with the 1984-1985 miners' strike, which sought to prevent mine closures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The strike's defeat led to the closure of many mines due to depleted, cheaply mined coal reserves and the availability of cheaper imported coal, resulting in thousands of job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:44]</a>. By the 1990s, Northeast England felt marginalized within the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:50]</a>.

Unlike Scotland, its northern neighbor, which benefited from the Barnett formula to attract multinational companies with more attractive investment packages, Northeast England often felt overlooked by London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:03:16]</a>. This context explains why the prospect of a semiconductor manufacturing facility resonated so profoundly when Siemens expressed interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Siemens' Semiconductor Ambitions

Siemens, an established German company, enjoyed a comfortable and profitable domestic position, supported by the German government through policies like the Bundesbank's requirement that firms produce equipment in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:57]</a>. This allowed Siemens to charge exorbitant prices with margins exceeding 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:07]</a>. However, with deregulation trends in the U.S. and UK by the 1980s, Siemens needed to become more competitive, leading to a decision to be more international, shareholder-friendly, and market-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:34]</a>.

The global semiconductor industry was booming in the mid-1990s, fueled by the release of Windows 95 and the rise of mobile phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:47]</a>. The industry saw growth rates of 29% in 1993, 32% in 1994, and 42% in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:05:02]</a>. In 1995 alone, a staggering $30 billion was invested in new chip fabrication facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:08]</a>.

Siemens Semiconductors, traditionally an in-house chip producer, began competing for its own customers in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:25]</a>. They focused on niche markets like application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for telecommunications, mobile phone, and automobile industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:39]</a>. Sales grew 40% annually in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:45]</a>. By 1994, Siemens was the 12th largest semiconductor maker globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:53]</a>, but with only 1.9% worldwide market share compared to 7% in Europe, they saw significant room for international growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:08]</a>. This led to a plan to triple chip sales and enter the top 10 rankings, largely through establishing semiconductor activities outside Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:29]</a>, including four new large-scale fabrication plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:44]</a>.

## The Siemens Fab in North Tyneside

In 1995, Siemens approached the "Invest in Britain" bureau about a UK wafer fabrication facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:54]</a>. The proposed fab, an exact copy of their successful Dresden facility, would cost about £1.1 billion (or $785 million USD) and create 2,000 jobs, making it the UK's biggest inward investment to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:16]</a>. Other potential locations included Ireland, Austria, Israel, Singapore, and Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Site Selection and Incentives

Siemens had several criteria for a new fab, including skilled, low-cost labor, excellent water and power infrastructure, geological stability, and ample government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:41]</a>. North Tyneside in Northeast England met all these requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:46]</a>. The area offered skilled technicians willing to work shifts, and Siemens could recruit electronics and computing graduates from local universities or Scotland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:59]</a>. Salaries were 50% lower than in Austria or Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:02]</a>.

To address concerns about electricity infrastructure, the government offered a direct connection to the national grid, a first for a private company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:14]</a>. Local development agencies actively courted Siemens, offering tours, university presentations, and significant government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:34]</a>. UK public support totaled £64 million (or $45 million USD), though not all was used, coming in the form of tax exemptions, grants, and job training subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:49]</a>. While Ireland and Austria offered more lavish support (Austria alone offered £120 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:59]</a>), the UK's package was considered a sound investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:09]</a>.

Snagging the Siemens fab was seen as an opportunity to establish Northeast England as a semiconductor hub, especially after Fujitsu had built a fab there in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:29]</a>. It was hoped to attract suppliers and other semiconductor companies, potentially kickstarting an entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:38]</a>. The UK government also saw it as a chance to transfer technology and skills to the local population and reduce semiconductor imports from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:50]</a>. Siemens ultimately chose the UK due to favorable financial terms and a commitment to the growing UK market, where its revenue grew 25% annually from 1985 to 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Construction and Initial Operation

Hours after the deal was announced, local job centers were overwhelmed with inquiries, with one center receiving 4,000 calls in three hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:35]</a>. Semiconductor fabs are typically built in phases to quickly capitalize on favorable market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:49]</a>. The North Tyneside fab was planned in two phases:
*   **Phase One**: Completion by mid-1997, producing 16-megabyte DRAM memory units using a 0.35-micron process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Phase Two**: Subsequent production of more advanced 64-megabyte memory units using a 0.25-micron process, increasing capacity to 20,000 wafer starts per month and meeting the full 2,000 job requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:22]</a>.

Construction proceeded rapidly, with contractors breaking ground before Siemens even owned the land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:26]</a>. Siemens opted for an innovative steel frame to accelerate building, completing the fab in just 376 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:38]</a>. Production began in May 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:41]</a>. The Queen herself toured the facility, proclaiming that the North Tyneside fab brought the country to the forefront of semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:54]</a>.

## The Fall of Siemens' Fab

In 1997, Siemens delayed Phase Two of the Tyneside plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:05]</a>. By July 1998, they announced the entire facility would close by the end of the year, less than two years after opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:13]</a>.

### Challenges and Market Volatility

The North Tyneside fab was on thin ice from the start due to its focus on the highly volatile DRAM market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:26]</a>. DRAM chips are cheap commodities, competing primarily on price with little differentiation, and are relatively easy to fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:43]</a>. This market is prone to oversupply, especially with many competitors in Asia, particularly South Korea, which held 40% of the market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:49]</a>.

Siemens' decision to equip the fab with older 16-megabyte memory technology was particularly perilous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:13:03]</a>. This technology was already becoming outdated by 1995, as Siemens' German plants were already producing 64-megabyte units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:12]</a>. The goal was to produce older memory modules profitably in a cheaper location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:21]</a>. However, [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenges in semiconductor manufacturing]] like the rapid pace of technological change mean that leading-edge technical mastery and market position are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:58]</a>. It would have been more sensible to produce either leading-edge 64-megabyte DRAM or logic chips like those from Intel and AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:47]</a>.

### The 1998 Market Crash

In 1998, the semiconductor market crashed, particularly in memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:51]</a>. The price per megabyte plummeted from $27 in 1995 to just $4 by the time the Tyneside plant opened in 1997, and further to $2 by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:14:01]</a>. Chips that sold for $50 in 1995 were selling for just $1 in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:11]</a>. South Korean giants, already struggling from the Asian financial crisis, flooded the market with memory wafers to stay afloat, collapsing industry-wide profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:20]</a>. Japanese companies like Fujitsu and Toshiba saw profits fall by nearly 90%, while Acer and Mitsubishi closed plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:30]</a>.

Siemens Semiconductor, which made a $65 million USD profit in the year ending September 1997, plunged to a stunning loss of $722 million USD by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:47]</a>. The semiconductor division's losses were particularly severe, forcing Siemens to cut costs, leading to the closure of the UK plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:15:00]</a>.

### Factors in the Closure

The North Tyneside fab lacked scale; it was not fully built out and had only a third of the capacity of Siemens' Dresden plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:10]</a>. Furthermore, it lacked strong internal or external backers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:17]</a>. Siemens would not risk its German or Austrian plants, and its facilities in the U.S., France, and Taiwan were joint ventures, making divestment difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:27]</a>. The pro-British management who initiated the plant's construction lost their jobs, including the CEO, replaced by a pro-German CEO who implemented severe cost-cutting measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:47]</a>.

The exit was financially costly, with closing North Tyneside costing nearly a quarter of a billion dollars, representing 45% of the division's projected loss that year, while only reducing overcapacity by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:16:03]</a>. Siemens also had to repay government grants, likely over £15 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:10]</a>. In August 1999, Siemens Semiconductor was spun off into Infineon Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:14]</a>.

## Atmel's Attempted Revival

After the closure, rumors of new buyers circulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:25]</a>. In September 2000, Atmel, a semiconductor firm producing higher-value products like flash NAND memory, radio frequency ICs, and logic products, emerged as a potential savior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:45]</a>. Atmel paid Siemens £25 million (or $35 million USD) for the facility and announced plans to invest £700 million (or $800 million USD) to retool it for flash memory and microcontroller circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:17:05]</a>. These markets were considered more stable than DRAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:09]</a>.

However, the dot-com crash in 2001 impacted the electronics industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:14]</a>. Atmel lost £31 million (or $45 million USD), revenues declined by 23%, and the company laid off 26% of its workforce (2,600 people), interrupting its Northeast England investment plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:27]</a>. Though Atmel initially did not rule out a new commitment, by 2006, they adopted a "fab-light" model and divested from four fabs, including North Tyneside in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:44]</a>. TSMC bought all the semiconductor production equipment, and the empty buildings were sold off, marking the final end of the semiconductor dream in the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:53]</a>.

## Legacy and Future Prospects

Today, the former fab facility has been transformed into the Cobalt Business Park, hosting government offices, call centers, and regional offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:18:02]</a>. The North Tyneside fab's closure was not an isolated event; 1998 alone saw the loss of 3,400 manufacturing jobs in Northeast England, including factories belonging to Electrolux and Pringle, and the Fujitsu fab that opened in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:26]</a>.

The region's economic challenge lies in its lack of native corporate leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:31]</a>. Most factory jobs were provided by foreign companies with little attachment to the area, who favored their homelands during financial crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:40]</a>.

Despite these setbacks, Northeast England is seeing "green shoots" of recovery, ironically in the energy sector once again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:19:02]</a>. Renewable energy companies have begun investing, fostering a growing wind industry, with projects like the Darker Bank wind farm poised to be one of the biggest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:14]</a>.

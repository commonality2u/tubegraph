Landing on Venus presents extraordinary [[engineering_breakthroughs_in_venera_landers | engineering challenges]] due to its extreme environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. The planet's conditions are so harsh that, despite multiple attempts, only the Soviet Union has successfully landed probes on its surface, with no other nation attempting a similar feat since the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

## The Hostile Venusian Environment

Venus is considered the second hardest place to land in the Solar System, surpassed only by the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. Often called "Earth's evil twin," it started similar to Earth but experienced a runaway greenhouse effect, leading to vastly different atmospheric conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

Key challenges include:
*   **Extreme Heat** The Venusian surface reaches 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius), making it hotter than Mercury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. During atmospheric entry, friction can heat a probe up to 11,000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **Crushing Pressure** The surface pressure is equivalent to being over 0.5 miles (a kilometer) underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This immense pressure is a significant factor in probe design.
*   **Corrosive Atmosphere** Venus has a thick atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Its clouds are made up of sulfuric acid, which is highly corrosive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

## Early Soviet Attempts and Lessons Learned

Before the successful [[venera_mission_successes_and_impacts | Venera mission successes and impacts]] with Venera 4, the Soviet Union faced 11 failures in its attempts to reach Venus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. The mission of the [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera project]] was to land a probe on the Venusian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

### Venera 4
Launched in autumn 1967, Venera 4 was a substantial probe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. It successfully launched its lander, which entered the atmosphere with temperatures reaching 11,000 degrees Celsius and entry forces up to 450G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Onboard instruments began transmitting data, initially showing temperatures similar to Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. However, both temperature and pressure began rising quickly, far higher than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

Ultimately, Venera 4 cracked open and was crushed 93 minutes into the mission, still over 27 kilometers above the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. At the point of failure, measurements indicated 22 atmospheres of pressure and 530 degrees Fahrenheit (277 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. Data from Venera 4 and the American Mariner 5 probe led scientists to conclude that Venus was far more hostile than previously believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

### Venera 5 and 6
Despite the new understanding from Venera 4, the construction for Venera 5 and 6 was already finalized, leaving no time for major changes before their 1969 launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. Engineers made minor strengthening adjustments, but the probes were not fully prepared for the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

*   **Venera 5** transmitted data for 53 minutes before succumbing to pressures of 27 atmospheres and temperatures of 600 degrees Fahrenheit (320 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.
*   **Venera 6** lasted for 51 minutes, descending 37.8 kilometers into the atmosphere before also being crushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

### Venera 7
For the 1970 launch window, directors were determined to reach the surface, knowing they needed to withstand 840 degrees Fahrenheit (450 degrees Celsius), 100 atmospheres, and corrosive acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Engineers consulted submarine designers for tips on deep pressure survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>, sourced new materials, and used a hotter, stronger test chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. The lander was built in an egg shape from titanium, with a smooth surface to minimize weak points, and an unknown internal insulation layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. The chamber was pre-chilled to freezing before entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

Despite these advancements, Venera 7 faced a new challenge: its parachute melted or tore six minutes into its second stage, causing the probe to drop like a rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. It hit the ground at 35 miles per hour (60 kilometers per hour) and bounced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. Initially thought crushed, radio astronomers later rediscovered a weak signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. The bounce had misaligned the antenna, reducing signal strength to 1-3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. It transmitted data for 23 minutes in temperatures hot enough to melt zinc or lead before its shell cracked and it too melted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

## Modern Challenges and Future Prospects

The [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Soviet Venera missions to Venus]] were stunning [[venera_mission_successes_and_impacts | successes]], but the last Venera landers were built in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. Since then, space programs have shifted focus to the Moon and Mars, partly because humans are unlikely to set foot on Venus alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>.

While engineers know it is possible to send another lander to Venus, the primary challenges now are economics and cost-benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. Investing significant resources into a probe that survives for less than a day is seen as "insane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>. Most [[future_possibilities_for_venus_exploration | future possibilities for Venus exploration]] proposals involve high-altitude floating explorations, like balloons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>.

For a lander to be economically viable, it would need to move around and last for weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>. The cooling technologies required for such longevity are still "a few years away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>. Additionally, much of the secret work from the Soviet era on the Venera series is now lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. However, interesting developments in extreme environment technologies might make a return trip possible in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>.

The city of Baku has historically been a significant site for oil production, dating back to the Russian Empire and continuing through the Soviet era.

## Early History and Russian Empire Control
The Russian Empire annexed Baku from the Iranians in the late 1820s, noting the presence of oil in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Throughout the 1800s, Baku emerged as one of the world's leading oil production sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. By its peak in the 1880s, oil production in Baku accounted for a third of America's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. By 1914, 90% of Russia's oil production originated from Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The Czar owned all the oil fields, and his government generated a quarter of its total revenues through indirect taxes on oil production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Despite state ownership, over 20 private companies managed the fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### The Nobel Brothers' Influence
One of the most prominent private companies was Nobel Brothers (Brand Nobel), founded by four foreign pioneers: Emil, Ludwig, Robert, and Alfred Nobel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The Nobel family had historical ties to the Russian Empire as arms dealers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

In 1873, Ludwig Nobel provided his brother Robert 25,000 rubles for acquiring Russian Walnut Wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Instead, Robert used the funds to purchase an oil refinery and began building a small company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Recognizing the significant opportunities, he brought Ludwig into the venture, leading to the establishment of the Nobel Brothers oil production company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

At its zenith, during its 38-year presence in Baku, Nobel Brothers ranked among the world's largest oil companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Russia's modern oil industry can trace its foundations to the systems and practices implemented by the Nobels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. With the Czar's support, Nobel Brothers pioneered the use of oil pipelines and tankers, making oil transport more economical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Many of these innovations were introduced despite objections from local communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Ludwig Nobel, as the primary shareholder, accumulated the largest fortune among the Nobel Brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Alfred Nobel did not participate in company operations but offered technical advice and held a substantial share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Baku's thriving private oil industry benefited from a more corporate-friendly shift in Russian tsarist policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Industrialists aimed to export their millions of barrels of production to challenge the global Standard Oil monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. However, this ambition was hindered by a lack of funds and divisions between bureaucrats and businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Decline and Bolshevik Takeover
The Baku oil industry began to stagnate, with overall oil production declining from a peak of 11.5 million metric tons in 1901 to 9.4 million metric tons by 1916 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. After 1904, Russia never managed to export more than a million tons of its production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

With the collapse of the Russian Empire, Shell and other major British oil companies attempted to annex the oil regions in 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. However, the British government refused armed intervention in the Caucasus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Western oil companies then suffered massive financial losses when the Soviets nationalized their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Shell, for example, lost approximately 171.4 million Rubles of British capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. French and German investors also lost millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Shell continued to anticipate the Soviet state's imminent collapse as late as 1925 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This represents a significant [[impact_of_bolshevik_policies_on_oil_companies | impact of Bolshevik policies on oil companies]].

During the Russian Civil War, the non-Russian ethnic groups in Baku tried to establish the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. However, Lenin and the Bolsheviks urgently needed Baku's oil to fuel their armies and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. In December 1920, the Red Army was dispatched to the Caucasus and reconquered the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

Upon recapture, Baku's oil fields were a "wasteland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Between natural field decline and war damage, production was only a third of pre-war levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Attempts at Foreign Engagement
In 1921, with the Soviet economy in disarray, Lenin initiated the New Economic Policy, reversing central planning policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. A controversial aspect was the potential resumption of concessions to foreign capitalists for natural resource exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Despite internal debate, Lenin advocated for this policy, winning an 8-6 vote in February 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. He argued that without concessions, the Soviets could not acquire advanced modern capitalist technology, essential for building large-scale industry, especially in petroleum extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Lenin, while anti-capitalist, demonstrated pragmatism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

Reports from Baku detailed broken transportation links, supply shortages, and salt water intrusions damaging oil fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. In April 1921, Baku workers went on strike to protest chronic shortages and poor working conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Although the strike was "liquidated," local recommendations urged the Soviets to engage global oil syndicates promptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Oil became a crucial opportunity for Soviet engagement with the global community post-World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. American oil giants saw cheap Soviet oil as a chance to overtake European competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. After nationalization, Nobel Brothers sold half of their Russian oil assets for $7-9 million to Standard Oil of New Jersey (now Exxon Mobil), which speculated on the Soviet Union's collapse and Nobel's asset reclamation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Standard, Shell, and Anglo-Persian Oil Company entered negotiations for vast concession tracks in Baku and Grozny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. A deal for Standard and Anglo-Persian to control half of Grozny and build a Black Sea pipeline almost materialized but Standard withdrew due to pressure from the Warren G. Harding Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

Despite Lenin's push, large foreign concession deals never fully materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. For instance, Sinclair Oil Corporation offered a $250 million loan in 1923 for a near-complete 25-year monopoly on Grozny's richest oil areas, which the Soviets declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Sinclair was granted a concession to Sakhalin Island, but Japan prevented drilling, and the company later pulled out due to the Teapot Dome scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Another small American company, International Barnsdell Corporation, was given permission to scout undeveloped lands in Baku but also withdrew by 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The U.S. government discouraged trade with the Soviet regime, viewing it as illegitimate due to repudiated debts, nationalized property, and calls for overthrowing the American government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This, combined with Lenin's illness, closed the window for foreign capitalism's return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Resurgence with British Equipment
The Soviets began drilling again on their own, with production surging from 4.2 million metric tons in 1921 to 6.3 million in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This recovery was aided by British equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Shell Vickers, a British weapons and engineering firm that had also suffered losses during Soviet nationalization (over two million pounds in assets), opted to engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. In 1922, the Soviets announced the national electrification plan (GOELRO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Vickers sold turbines to the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. In 1924, after a Soviet delegation was highly impressed by Vickers' modern oil drilling equipment in the UK, the Soviets decided to deploy it in their large oil fields in Baku and Grozny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

To pay for this, as grain exports were impractical due to the "scissors crisis," the Soviets turned to oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Over two years, Vickers supplied millions of pounds worth of oil equipment in exchange for a percentage of Soviet foreign oil sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. By 1926, oil was one of the few profitable Soviet export sectors, providing a substantial sum to Vickers and supporting their struggling oil equipment business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## World War II and Postwar Shift
On the eve of World War II, the Soviet oil industry, including Baku, was stagnant and underfunded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. The German invasion (Operation Barbarossa) in June 1941, changed this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Germany's mobile army needed gasoline, but they lacked a reliable supply, sourcing much of their reserves from Romania and their own coal liquefaction industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. This was a critical aspect of [[soviet_oil_strategy_during_world_war_ii | Soviet oil strategy during World War II]].

In 1942, after their attempt to capture Moscow was thwarted, the Germans devised "Case Blue" to capture the oil-rich cities of the Caucasus, including Baku and Grozny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. German leadership believed these resources would alleviate their oil shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. However, logistical challenges and winter weather halted German forces far from the oil fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. The Luftwaffe was ordered to bomb the fields to disable the Soviet oil industry, but they were too far to seriously damage Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

Anticipating a German arrival in Baku, the Red Army urgently began evacuating personnel and machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Drilling equipment, pipelines, and entire refineries were disassembled and moved to the Volga-Ural area, which became known as "the second Baku" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

As a result, oil production in the Caucasus was devastated, dropping by over 50% in a single year to levels not seen since the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Azerbaijani historians view this period grimly, as production rates did not return to 1941 levels until after the Soviet Union dissolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The Allies also considered bombing the fields if the Germans succeeded in capturing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

After the war, the Soviets learned the importance of oil and sought to control as much as possible, occupying Romania and temporarily Austria's oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. The Soviet Union relied on imported oil from these countries until the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. To revitalize production, the Red Army confiscated oil technologies, much of which was Western-sourced, and brought it back as war booty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

Throughout the 1950s, the Soviets significantly invested in developing the oil fields of the Volga-Ural Basin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Baku was no longer the priority, and its production rates suffered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. By the end of the 1950s, fields like the Romashkino oil field (4,200 square kilometers) were producing more oil than the rest of the country's regions combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The Volga-Ural Basin remains a significant oil production area today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

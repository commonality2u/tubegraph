From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 
The [[history_of_australian_automobile_manufacturing | Australian automobile industry]] once employed 100,000 people, producing tens of thousands of vehicles for both domestic consumption and export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00"></a>. These cars were uniquely suited for the Australian market and were highly valued in rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10"></a>. However, this industry has now largely vanished, with the last major factory, operated by Toyota, closing in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16"></a>.

## Rise of the Industry and Early Protection
Following World War II, the [[government_policies_and_the_automotive_industry | Australian government focused on car manufacturing]] as a high-priority sector to rebuild its economy and nurture manufacturing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02"></a>. Subsidies and tax concessions were offered to foreign companies to encourage production on Australian soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15"></a>. Manufacturers like Volkswagen, British Motors Leyland, and Ford entered the market, initially mostly bolting together imported parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22"></a>.

General Motors-Holden, an Australian subsidiary of GM, was a key player. In 1948, it produced the first all-Australian car, the Holden, in Melbourne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38"></a>. This rugged vehicle was well-suited for Australia's rural areas and quickly dominated the market throughout the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52"></a>. By 1951, Holden sold over 25,000 units and became the country's most profitable publicly traded company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04"></a>. Australian cars, particularly rugged models like the Holden ute (pickup truck), became a fixture of the national culture, embodying a spirit of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17"></a>.

This domestic manufacturing industry thrived within a [[impact_of_global_trade_on_australian_car_production | protected product market]] where high [[impact_of_global_trade_on_australian_car_production | tariffs]] ensured demand for domestic employers, who could then pass on the costs of a "fair and reasonable basic wage" backed by strong trade unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46"></a>.

## The "Worst of Both Worlds"
Despite local success, none of the Australian carmakers were actually owned by Australians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49"></a>. This foreign ownership presented both upsides and downsides:
*   **Upside**: The industry benefited from being part of larger global networks, allowing Australian-made auto components to be produced at scale and exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57"></a>.
*   **Downside**: The companies could not embed themselves deeply within the local industry. The Australian government knew profits flowed to foreign headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10"></a>. Foreign executives lacked emotional attachment to Australia, making decisions based purely on the bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26"></a>. This meant Australia did not control its own automaking destiny, a "worst of both worlds" situation that would eventually become a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36"></a>.

## Decline in Competitiveness (1970s)
By the early 1970s, the domestic automotive manufacturing industry employed over 100,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47"></a>. However, the decade saw a substantial loss of competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58"></a>.
*   **Lack of Economies of Scale**: Automakers produced too many models (five companies producing 15 models), with individual production runs as small as 25,000 units, leading to a lack of economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07"></a>.
*   **Loss of Customer Connection**: While Australian cars were treasured for their ruggedness, most of the country's population lived in cities, creating market gaps, especially in the small car segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18"></a>.

### Rise of Japanese Imports
This market gap was filled by high-quality, low-cost Japanese imports, which quickly gained a significant foothold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33"></a>. For example, the [[challenges_facing_nissan_in_the_automotive_industry | Datsun made by Nissan]] saw sales grow to nearly 20,000 units by 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45"></a>.

### Whitlam Government Reforms
The 1972 election of the [[government_policies_and_the_automotive_industry | Whitlam government]] brought substantial reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56"></a>. This Labor Party administration viewed foreign-owned carmakers unfavorably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08"></a>. In 1973, facing strong demand and rising inflation, the government, after strengthening the currency, decided to reduce [[impact_of_global_trade_on_australian_car_production | tariffs]] and other [[impact_of_global_trade_on_australian_car_production | trade barriers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14"></a>. They believed a more liberal trade policy would provide a competitive jolt and expand international trade, particularly cementing reorientation towards Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44"></a>. This policy was supported by Japan and other developing countries buying significant amounts of Australian minerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09"></a>.

The most controversial aspect was an abrupt 25% reduction in all tariffs on imported goods in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36"></a>. This confrontational tactic led GM Holden to fire 5,000 workers, sparking a political crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49"></a>.

### External Economic Shocks
The 1973 OPEC oil embargo and the collapse of the Bretton Woods monetary regime ended post-war prosperity, leading to soaring oil prices (300% increase), inflation, and unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07"></a>. This spurred sales of gas-efficient small and medium four-cylinder cars, a market dominated by the Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26"></a>. While absolute sales of large six-cylinder cars (the domain of Australian carmakers) remained flat, their share of the overall market collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38"></a>. This illustrated the concept of disruptive innovation, where upstarts gain a foothold and move upmarket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01"></a>.

### Local Assembly by Foreign Firms
To avoid tariffs, two major Japanese automakers, [[challenges_facing_nissan_in_the_automotive_industry | Toyota and Nissan]], set up domestic Australian assembly operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16"></a>. Nissan Motors eventually purchased a local assembly facility in Clayton, Victoria, and made it a regional headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30"></a>. These operations brought the Japanese into contact with Australia's labor policies, navigating tensions with eight trade unions at the Clayton plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41"></a>.

### Industry Contraction and Missed Opportunities
As the six-cylinder market declined, thousands of jobs were lost throughout the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01"></a>. British Motors Leyland closed its Australian operations in 1975, cutting 2,600 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09"></a>. The worsening economic situation forced the government to reimpose import quotas, which stemmed some bleeding but did not fully halt the decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25"></a>.

A major missing ingredient was a government entity to coordinate the industry's transition, unlike [[challenges_in_japans_aircraft_industry | Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry or MITI]], which actively guided its car industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44"></a>. The four remaining domestic OEMs had to face this new world alone and navigated it poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56"></a>.

The same macro trends eroding the domestic market also annihilated Australia's critical export market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25"></a>. While the industry produced 60,000 units for export in 1970, by 1979, this had dwindled to just a few hundred, signaling deep uncompetitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41"></a>.

## Later Government Reforms (1980s Onwards)
In the mid-1980s, a new government under Prime Minister Hawke enacted major macroeconomic policy changes, including banking deregulation, financial market liberalization, and floating the Australian dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48"></a>. The goal was to reorient domestic manufacturing towards exports, moving away from a long history of protectionism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00"></a>.

The [[government_policies_and_the_automotive_industry | New car plan]], introduced in late 1983 by Senator John Button, offered car manufacturers credits and subsidies for Australian-made cars, along with generous but temporary government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39"></a>. However, it also rapidly reduced import tariffs from 57.5% to 45% by 1988, with further reductions planned until 2000, and removed import quotas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54"></a>. The intention was to slim down the domestic industry into a leaner, more competitive entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07"></a>.

The shrinking part of the plan went as expected: Ford lost $60 million in 1992 and laid off thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12"></a>. The 1980s and 1990s saw plant closures by all domestic automakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19"></a>. Unexpectedly, Australian-made cars became even less competitive as domestic carmakers responded with cost-cutting, reducing investment in R&D and manufacturing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24"></a>. Foreign companies had primarily entered the Australian market to bypass trade protections, and when these vanished, they saw little reason to maintain expensive manufacturing operations there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45"></a>.

## 2000s Challenges and Final Collapse
Through the 1990s and early 2000s, domestic assembly stabilized at around 350,000 units annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08"></a>. However, as Australia's economy and population grew, the domestic makers' share of the overall market continued to shrink, despite $500 million AUD of annual government support through schemes like the Automotive Competitive and Investment Scheme (ACIS), which cost the government $7 billion AUD from 2001 to 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17"></a>.

The 2000s also brought a decades-long [[challenges_of_domestic_natural_gas_shortages_in_australia | mining boom]] fueled by demand from China and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50"></a>. While beneficial in some ways, this boom caused a dramatic appreciation of the Australian dollar, which doubled in value against the American dollar between 2001 and 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03"></a>. This stronger currency dramatically increased the cost of Australian automotive production, leading to chronic losses for the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30"></a>. From 2003 to 2010, the industry lost 25,000 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40"></a>.

### Mitsubishi's Closure
In April 2004, Mitsubishi announced the closure of its engine and assembly plants in Southern Adelaide, leading to 1,167 job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46"></a>. This area had been dependent on manufacturing, which made up 18% of its employment in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04"></a>. The federal government provided $40 million AUD to the region and $10 million AUD to help retrenched workers, with the state government adding $5 million AUD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18"></a>. However, these funds were often misdirected or insufficient; by 2005, each domestically produced Mitsubishi car was already receiving $1,300 AUD in subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51"></a>. The worker assistance programs also failed to properly re-skill or re-employ workers due to miscategorization of their transferable skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03"></a>. Mitsubishi closed its plant for good in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50"></a>.

### Global Financial Crisis and Government Stance
The global financial crisis led the Australian government to implement targeted subsidy programs like the Green Car Innovation Fund and the Automotive Transformation Scheme, subsidizing investment and research, especially in energy efficiency and green technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54"></a>. A $200 million AUD line of credit was also provided to GM Holden to help it restructure after GM filed for bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18"></a>. However, the Mitsubishi closure was seen as the beginning of the end for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30"></a>.

In 2013, a new conservative-leaning government under Prime Minister Tony Abbott came to power, disagreeing with previous government interventions in the automaking industry, stating that "the government's role is not to prop up private business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01"></a>. They questioned why cars should receive preferential treatment when other manufacturing sectors were also suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32"></a>.

### Industry's Diminished Capacity and High Costs
By this point, the Australian automobile manufacturing industry was a shadow of its former self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41"></a>. Modern car manufacturers aim for 250,000 cars per factory annually, but in the early 2000s, GM Holden produced 160,000, Mitsubishi struggled at 35,000, and Ford did about 70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44"></a>.

Australian labor was expensive, costing multiples more than labor in emerging low-cost manufacturing hubs like China and Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04"></a>. While unions in countries like Canada and the United States made concessions on wages and production lines to help carmakers, Australian labor unions came around late in the process, collaborating with GM Holden but ultimately not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18"></a>.

Ultimately, government support was paramount, but the industry had absorbed billions in subsidies with little to show for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54"></a>. Government-industry relations deteriorated, with public comments like Finance Minister Joe Hockey's "either you're here or you're not" and constant policy uncertainty contributing to instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15"></a>. Faced with this, [[challenges_facing_nissan_in_the_automotive_industry | Toyota and GM]] pulled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50"></a>.

## Consequences of Industry Demise
The loss of Australia's domestic auto industry had wide-ranging consequences:
*   **Domestic Components Industry**: 260 Australian businesses supplied the automotive sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01"></a>. Without the domestic assembly industry as an anchor, many could not achieve sufficient economies of scale and closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08"></a>. For example, 70% of the Toyota Camry's parts were once made in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22"></a>.
*   **Research and Development (R&D)**: R&D spending by Australian automotive companies vanished, having previously accounted for 2% of the country's entire R&D spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29"></a>.
*   **Laid-off Workers**: Approximately 14,000 people lost their jobs after the Toyota and GM Holden factories closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54"></a>. A survey two years later found that less than half were still working, with many retiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03"></a>. Government and community support helped cushion the financial blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24"></a>.
*   **Cultural Impact**: The industry's demise closed a uniquely Australian chapter of history. Despite foreign ownership, Australian cars like the Holden ute were seen as thoroughly Australian, mythologizing the pioneering spirit and the backyard inventor thriving against odds in the harsh outback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30"></a>.

## Conclusion: Who is to Blame?
There are no clear heroes or villains in this story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28"></a>. Australia enjoys natural resources but faces challenges from its remote location and higher costs of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34"></a>. Despite billions poured into the industry, the economics and economies of scale were not there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44"></a>.

A key missed opportunity was the government's lack of deeper involvement at critical times, unlike [[challenges_in_japans_aircraft_industry | Japan's MITI]], which forcibly merged carmakers to create national champions like [[challenges_facing_nissan_in_the_automotive_industry | Toyota and Nissan]] in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54"></a>. Had the Australian government intervened similarly, merging the five domestic OEMs into one and taking a controlling share, the industry might still be alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13"></a>.

Despite the end of local car manufacturing, there's a positive outlook: Toyota and other automakers continue to tap Australia's educated labor to [[future_prospects_for_australian_automotive_technology | develop new automotive technologies]] for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26"></a>. The former Toyota Altona factory is even being converted into a transport hub for green hydrogen technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37"></a>.

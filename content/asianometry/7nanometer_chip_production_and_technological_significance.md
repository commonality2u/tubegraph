In late August 2023, Huawei began selling its own phone chips again, quietly introducing the Huawei Mate 60 Pro with its Kirin 9000s system-on-a-chip (SOC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This chip is a [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | 7-nanometer class chip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, most likely manufactured by [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, marking a significant [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | advancement]] for [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | China's domestic semiconductor ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

It's important to note that labels like "7 nanometers" are marketing names for classes of chips and do not reflect the transistors' actual physical sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. These names signal a class of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>.

## The Kirin 9000s Chip

The Kirin 9000s is a 107 square millimeter die, approximately 2% larger than the Kirin 9000 and 9000E, which were Huawei's last leading-edge chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>. Those earlier chips were briefly produced using TSMC's 5-nanometer process before American sanctions ended the association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:02">[01:54:02]</a>. This new [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | 7-nanometer class chip]] is about 5-6 years behind the current leading edge, as TSMC has been shipping 3-nanometer class chips in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

Teardowns and speed tests suggest the Kirin 9000s supports 5G connectivity, although Huawei appears to be concealing this, omitting 5G support in press releases and having the phone's OS report 4G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:02">[02:15:02]</a>. The SOC’s CPU core is a customization of Arm IP, while the GPU seems to be a new custom design by Huawei or HiSilicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:02">[02:49:02]</a>.

Initial yields for [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]]’s [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | N+2 process node]] are likely higher than expected and will ramp up as more phones are sold, similar to how [[comparison_of_smics_n2_to_tsmcs_n7 | TSMC scaled N7's yields]] for iPhone launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:05">[03:06:05]</a>. Despite limited released information, this [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | 7nm chip]] is real and the node that produced it appears to be very good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>.

## Why This Matters: The [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | 7nm]] Breakthrough

The existence of this [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | 7nm]] chip, produced by [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] using its [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | N+2 process node]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:07">[03:56:07]</a>, was anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:01">[04:06:01]</a>. News of the [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC N+2 process]] first emerged in July 2022, when it was used for Bitcoin miners, which are ideal for improving a node due to their repetitive structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. Producing a complex phone SOC like the Kirin 9000s on this node demonstrates the tremendous progress [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] has made in about a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:06">[04:36:06]</a>.

This [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | advancement]] suggests that even more advanced chips are likely coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:02">[04:54:02]</a>. Dr. Burn Lin, a legendary TSMC R&D director, stated in January 2022 that [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] could fabricate 5-nanometer-class chips using only multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:04">[04:58:04]</a>. Immersion lithography, an older but still highly effective technology, is key to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. While the United States banned EUV lithography exports, 193-nanometer immersion machines (like ASML Twinscan NXT 2000i) still perform 70-80% of lithography work for leading foundries in their latest nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:01">[05:26:01]</a>.

The ban on 193i immersion machines, which came into full effect in June 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>, means [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] still possesses many of these machines to ramp up [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | 7nm]] production and potentially move to 5nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:06">[06:25:06]</a>. Therefore, a 5-nanometer class Huawei chip is expected within 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:02">[06:40:02]</a>.

## A China-Only Supply Line and Future Directions

The Mate 60 Pro is significant not just for its chip, but for its integration within an [[developments_in_chinas_domestic_semiconductor_ecosystem | ecosystem of domestic Chinese suppliers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. With the exception of memory (which seems to have come from SK Hynix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>, the entire phone is basically a China-only ecosystem, encompassing radio frequency modules and satellite communications modems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:04">[07:10:04]</a>. This sets the stage for a complete, self-contained ecosystem within China to produce various domestic electronics, including smartphone SOCs, CPUs, NPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:02">[07:31:02]</a>.

While a five-year-old equivalent phone chip might not seem revolutionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>, it will significantly impact Qualcomm, Apple, and MediaTek, as tens of millions of chip sales for Huawei phones are likely to be replaced by the new Kirin 9000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. Every non-Chinese semiconductor maker and Apple will lose business to this new domestic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

After fulfilling Huawei orders, [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] is expected to seek new [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | N+2 node]] customers in high-powered computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>, potentially partnering to create a Chinese [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | 7nm]] AI accelerator within 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

### China's Strategic Steps

For [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | China]], the main goal should be to widely distribute this phone to scale production, selling millions more units not just domestically but also to European, Australian, Southeast Asian, and Latin American consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. Every export sale weakens Western phone makers and strengthens [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] by increasing yields and profitability, accelerating its move to 5 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

Additionally, [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] should review and replicate advanced packaging technologies like chiplets and 2.5D die-stacking, necessary for high-bandwidth applications like advanced AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:04">[09:57:04]</a>. The Chinese Government must also shore up its domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment ecosystem, aiming to replace foreign suppliers like ASML, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, and Lam Research, as foreign equipment likely contains "kill switches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

## US Response and Export Controls

The US government's justification for cutting off foreign support for advanced semiconductors (16/14nm or below) stems from intelligence indicating that China's ability to manufacture such chips has significant implications for the regional military balance of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. Given the progress by [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] and Huawei, if the US government views a Chinese [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | 7nm]] node as a national security threat, it may intensify efforts to stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

Currently, [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] relies on foreign equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:05">[12:07:05]</a>. Equipment companies like Applied, Lam Research, Tokyo Electron, and KLA can still sell most of their tools used for 7nm and even 5nm, as these can also be plausibly used for older 28nm nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. These tools are ostensibly sold for lagging-edge nodes but are likely repurposed for advanced chips like the Kirin 9000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.

To prevent China from developing leading-edge capacity at scale, the US government, in cooperation with allies, should consider tighter export controls on tools currently being repurposed, such as Argon Fluoride Immersion lithography, mask, and CMP equipment, and be less liberal with licenses for firms like [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:04">[12:47:04]</a>.

## A Historical Parallel

The Kirin 9000s is a visible mark on technology history, akin to Samsung's [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | advancements]] in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. In 1986, Samsung shocked Japan with its 1 megabit DRAM chip, closing the [[europes_historical_semiconductor_development_and_challenges | Korean-Japanese semiconductor gap]] from five years to just one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. By 1988, Samsung achieved parity with Japan with its 4 megabit chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

[[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | China]] is taking a similar approach to semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:02">[13:54:02]</a>. This strategy worked for South Korea and appears to be working for [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | China]] as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.

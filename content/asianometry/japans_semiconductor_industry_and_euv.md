In 2019, ASML shipped its first high-volume [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, marking the semiconductor lithography industry's shift away from Asia towards Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This was a significant loss for Japan, as Japanese companies had led the lithography industry before ASML's rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Japan discovered EUV, but its companies were unable to commercialize it in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. [[japans_failed_euv_development_journey | Japan's failed EUV development journey]] illustrates the [[challenges_in_developing_euv_systems | incredible challenge of producing commercial-ready EUV systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Early EUV Invention and American Intervention

[[the_evolution_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] was invented in Japan in 1986 by Dr. Hiro Kinoshita at NTT, who successfully printed a circuit pattern using [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV light]] and a reflective optic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. At the time, EUV was one of several potential next-generation lithography candidates, including Electron Beam direct write, proximity X-ray, ion beam projection, Electron Beam projection, and 157 nanometer fluorine lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The Japanese lithography industry studied all these options, but their main preference seemed to be proximity X-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Even as late as 1997, SEMATECH evaluated [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV]] in fourth place, with X-ray in first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

However, the American semiconductor leader Intel observed demonstrations in Japan and at Department of Energy labs and saw potential in [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. To prevent the Department of Energy's [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV]] project R&D team from disbanding, Intel provided bridge funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. A year later, Intel and other American semiconductor manufacturers founded EUV LLC in 1998, an industry-wide consortium designed to provide an estimated $60 million per year for R&D to commercialize [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV lithography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Intel's interest caught the Japanese by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Due to American restrictions on foreign participation, Japan's lithography makers, Nikon and Canon, could not directly join EUV LLC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. They were, however, allowed to participate in design reviews and working groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Japan's EUV Development Program

Forced to pivot, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched its own [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV lithography]] program in 1998, a year after EUV LLC's founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

The Japanese [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV]] lithography development plan had three phases:

*   **Phase 1 (1998-2001):** Develop basic technologies for the [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV]] lithography system's three parts: exposure tool, mask, and resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The government-funded research organization ASET (Association of Super Advanced Electronic Technologies), fully funded by MITI, was in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Phase 2 (2001-2003):** Another organization would turn ASET's raw technology into a working prototype, with partial financial support from the Japan semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Phase 3 (2004-2006):** The Japanese semiconductor industry, presumably led by Selete (Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies) and lithography makers Nikon and Canon, would transform the prototype into a commercial product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Selete is an industry-funded R&D consortium with a $90 million annual budget, focusing on applied technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Key Challenges and Component Development

ASET faced a formidable task, addressing the three basic systems of the [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | lithography machine]]:

#### Exposure Tool
The exposure tool includes an [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV light source]] and an optic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. It fires high-powered light, which reflects off the mask (containing the chip design) and then falls onto a wafer coated with a photosensitive chemical called resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. While the [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV lithography machine's]] basic systems shared a philosophical heritage with predecessors, the engineering required substantial new work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

ASET focused its limited resources on optics manufacturing, including adding reflective multi-layers to mirrors, cleaning them, and metrology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This meant they could not work on the exposure tool's light source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This task was reassigned to a new industry organization, the Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography System Development Association (EUVA), founded in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. EUVA included academia and industry, with five equipment companies (Ushio, Canon, Nikon, Komatsu, Gigaphoton) and four semiconductor manufacturers (Toshiba, NEC, Fujitsu, Renesas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology was also involved due to academic participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

EUVA explored two approaches for producing [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV light]]:
*   **Laser-produced plasma (LPP):** Firing a laser at a material to turn it into plasma, which emits [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV light]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This was the approach ASML eventually chose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Discharge-produced plasma (DPP):** Creating a cloud of material and then firing high-powered sparks between electrodes to create light-emitting plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

#### Photoresist
ASET also handled the [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV photoresist]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. A major challenge was [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV light's]] high absorbability for traditional resist materials; [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV light]] could only travel about 700 angstroms deep into the resist layer, significantly less than the traditional 4,000 angstroms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This necessitated the development of "Thin Layer Imaging" (TLI) technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, in which ASET collaborated with Himeji Institute of Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

#### Mask
The mask contains the chip design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. ASET needed new subsystems for producing mirror mask blanks (masks without patterns), adding patterns, and cleaning surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. A critical goal was to consistently produce defect-free photomasks, immensely difficult due to the incredible tolerances involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The intermediate goal was 0.1 to 1 defects per square centimeter, eventually needing to reach 0.003 defects per square centimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. The threshold for a defect was a deviance of just a few nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

Unlike [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | DUV light]], [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV light]] itself is required to detect defects by penetrating deep into the blank's mirror layer, a process known as "actinic light" inspection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) established a separate organization for this: the mask and lithography-related Metrology inspection group within the Mirai research consortium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

By 2005, the [[japans_failed_euv_development_journey | Japanese EUV effort]] had expanded to four research consortia:
*   **ASET:** Resist, contamination control, multi-layer mirror masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>
*   **EUVA:** Exposure tool light source and some optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>
*   **Leading Project:** Inter-university collaboration on light sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>
*   **Mirai:** Mask defect control detection subsystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>

This complex setup contrasted with the American [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV lithography]] project, which had a single entity, EUV LLC, overseeing early commercialization from 1997 to 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. After 2003, ASML took over from Silicon Valley Group Lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. The [[comparison_between_japanese_and_american_euv_efforts | American and Japanese programs shared information]], but the Americans were clearly in the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## Canon's EUV Efforts

Canon was the "junior and lacking partner" in the [[japans_failed_euv_development_journey | Japanese EUV efforts]], as they had not yet mastered 193-nanometer immersion lithography, the most advanced technology before [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

In 2006, Canon and EUVA completed their small-field prototype [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV lithography]] tool, the SFET, installed at an R&D Center for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. It generated [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV light]] by firing a 248-nanometer Krypton Fluorine laser at a jet of xenon gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Canon aimed to start producing their full-field six-mirror prototype, the VS2, in 2009, with completion scheduled for 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

However, Canon struggled with core [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV]] problems, including raising the [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV power level]], producing defect-free masks, and extending optic system lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Amidst the 2008 global financial crisis, Canon, as the world's largest digital camera maker, saw profits shrink over 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. With annual lithography R&D expenses exceeding $600 million, the company likely decided to cut back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Canon never built the VS2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>, and as of the video's production, only sold KrF non-immersion or dry lithography systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

## Nikon's EUV Efforts

Nikon, as Japan's lithography leader and the world's only producer of immersion lithography other than ASML, was ahead of Canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. From 2001 to 2004, Nikon collaborated with ASET to produce three iterations of their small-field prototype [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV]] tool, nicknamed Hina (High Numerical Aperture tool) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

In April 2006, Nikon felt ready to produce their first full-field exposure tool, a six-mirror system called the EUV-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This "Alpha device" was completed and installed at the Selete R&D Research Center, going live in January 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This progress was about 1.5 years behind ASML's 2006 Alpha demo tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. According to Japan's 2005 timeline, a "beta [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV]] device" should have been ready by 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, indicating a delay.

Despite being Asia's most advanced lithography machine, the EUV-1 was not commercially competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Its late installation pushed the [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV]] high-volume ship schedule back from the 45-nanometer process node to the 32-nanometer node, with talk of 28- and 22-nanometer nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This presented a major problem, as more advanced process nodes required greater [[advancements_in_euv_power_efficiency | EUV machine and light source power]], and the EUV-1's light source power output was a significant drawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

The EUV-1 used a Discharge-Produced Plasma (DPP) contraption made by Ushio and its German subsidiary, Extreme Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. The DPP approach, while potentially more power-efficient, physically smaller, and cleaner than LPP, struggled to output sufficient power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. Less power meant longer wafer exposure and slower throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. The EUV-1's light source topped out at 100 Watts, far below the intermediate goal of 110-180 Watts and the high-volume production goal of 250 Watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Achieving this would require a major system change, replacing Xenon with Tin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

> [!INFO] Tin-based DPP EUV Light Source
> This design involved two wheel-shaped electrodes, about 20 meters in diameter, suspended over a bath of molten tin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. As the electrodes spun, their edges picked up a layer of molten tin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. A low-power laser fired pulses at the wheel's edge, vaporizing the tin to form a cloud of tin atoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Electrodes then discharged a massive current, causing the cloud to collapse and heat to 200,000 degrees Celsius, emitting [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV photons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
>
> While ingenious, this contraption struggled with contamination and insufficient power output for economic viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. ASML also tried DPP but halted work in 2013, as sufficient power levels were only achieved with their laser double-shot method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. It's likely Nikon would have eventually shifted to the LPP approach, potentially with Gigaphoton as the supplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

Tests at Selete, in partnership with Intel, showed the EUV-1 could produce fine vertical lines (26-33 nanometers wide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. However, the device struggled with contamination control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV light]] continually hitting the mirror's surface created carbon contamination, deteriorating reflectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. Introducing pure oxygen and using [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV dry cleaning]] helped, but the team then faced a mysterious contamination from a silicon carbon compound called siloxane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. As of 2011, Nikon's researchers were still struggling to overcome these widespread contamination issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

After the EUV-1's testing, Nikon was to proceed with the EUV2, scheduled for completion in 2011-2012 for 32-nanometer production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. However, ASML's lead grew to 18 months or even two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. With the global financial crisis in full force, Nikon cut R&D budgets in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. While Nikon denied rumors of halting [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV]] development entirely, they clarified that the EUV2 would remain an in-house unit, with the EUV3 planned for 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

In 2010, market sales for lithography machines in the chip and LCD industries halved year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Despite this, Nikon continued internal research into 2011, targeting 16 to 11-nanometer process nodes (around 2016) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This was the last significant report on Nikon's EUV2 or EUV3 progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.

In July 2012, Intel, Nikon's second-biggest customer after Samsung, announced an agreement to invest up to $4 billion in ASML for a stake of up to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. Nikon's shares fell seven percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. Intel, known for sourcing lithography machines from multiple vendors, was clearly moving forward with ASML alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. In 2011, Nikon spent ¥28.4 billion ($355 million) on R&D and capital expenditures for lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Without Intel as a cornerstone customer, Nikon likely decided it was not worth spending hundreds of millions annually to continue [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV]] development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. Nikon's [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV]] efforts quietly tailed off, and the EUV3 never made its 2012 ship date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. ASML became the last company standing in the [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV lithography industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

## Legacy and Cost of Japan's EUV Effort

While Japan's [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV]] efforts did not result in a commercial lithography machine, many component developments became viable, technologically advanced businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. For instance, the actinic blank inspection tool from Mirai, in collaboration with Lasertec, is a successful product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Japanese companies like JSR, Shin-Etsu, and Tokyo Ohka Kogyo hold dominant positions in the [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV photoresist]] space, and Tokyo Electron makes equipment to apply these resists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Total Cost
> A rough estimate of the total cost of [[japans_failed_euv_development_journey | Japan's EUV effort]] from 1999 to 2012 is between $5 billion and $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. This includes Nikon and Canon's R&D expenses, the $90 million annual budgets of ASET and the four consortia, and a fudge factor for investments by other semiconductor makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. By [[comparative_analysis_of_semiconductor_industry_growth_in_europe_us_and_japan | comparison]], the original VLSI project that remade Japan's [[comparative_analysis_of_semiconductor_industry_growth_in_europe_us_and_japan | semiconductor industry]] and spawned its lithography dominance in the late 1970s cost about $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>, highlighting the exponential jump in costs.

The [[japans_failed_euv_development_journey | story of Japan's EUV failure]] was a close race where economics and competition, rather than insurmountable technological problems, ultimately stopped their progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. Developing an independent [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV machine]] today would likely require at least $5-10 billion, direct guidance from European and American [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV]] makers, and 10-15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

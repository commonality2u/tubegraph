The Soviet Union's space exploration efforts from 1960 to 1973 were marked by intense competition with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While they achieved significant successes in some areas, particularly with [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus|missions to Venus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, their extensive [[soviet_mars_missions_from_1960_to_1973|Mars program]] frequently encountered setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Foundations of the Soviet Space Program

The Soviet space program's genesis can be traced to 1950, when Stalin sought a missile capable of reaching Western adversaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Sergey Korolev, born in Ukraine, was tasked with this goal. He leveraged his background in gliders and rockets to reverse-engineer German V2 rocket designs during the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Korolev eventually delivered the R7 missile, which was successfully test-fired in 1957, after Stalin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The political climate loosened following Stalin's passing, enabling Korolev to pursue his aspirations for space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. He envisioned the R7 rocket for space travel, not solely as a military tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Sputnik's Global Impact

In January 1956, after considerable lobbying, the Politburo sanctioned the development of an artificial satellite, initially named "Object D" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This radio-equipped sphere became known as Sputnik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. After three launch failures, Sputnik was successfully placed into orbit on October 4, 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

The launch of Sputnik created a significant international stir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. While Soviet media reported on their space progress, few in the West believed it until Sputnik was in orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The New York Times used headline font sizes unseen since Pearl Harbor, and American political elites were spurred to catch up, while Soviet leaders reveled in the unexpected triumph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Capitalizing on this success, Korolev and his team proposed a moon expedition in January 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. By July 1958, this expanded into a vast program, starting with robotic spacecraft to Mars and Venus using an upgraded three-stage R7 rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The long-term vision included a four-stage R7 for human missions to the Moon, Venus, and Mars, ultimately leading to planetary colonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Challenges in Interplanetary Travel

While the Soviet space program focused its resources on lunar probes in 1958 and 1959, their ultimate goal was planetary exploration, with Mars being the "real prize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This required exploiting an orbital window for Mars occurring approximately every 25 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Interplanetary travel demanded significantly higher speeds (11 kilometers per second) compared to Earth orbit (7 kilometers per second), necessitating additional stages for the R7 rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Achieving safe launches at these speeds was not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Political Pressure and Early Mars Failures

The space race intensified, and in January 1960, Khrushchev expressed concern to Korolev about the growing American space program, demanding launches to Mars and Venus within the 1960 window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Korolev drafted "Project 1M" for Mars, targeting a September 1960 launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The two 1M spacecraft, weighing around 640 kilograms, were designed for a new, more powerful four-stage R7 rocket, the 8K78 "Molniya" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. In February 1960, this rocket stage only existed on paper, forcing Korolev's team to build it from scratch under immense pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The rushed production resulted in faulty components and probes that arrived in pieces, requiring extensive repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Instruments for detecting life were included, but other planned systems like an ultraviolet spectrograph and television system were removed due to integration issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

The first 1M rocket, launched on October 10, 1960, suffered heavy vibrations during its second stage, causing it to break up over Eastern Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The second probe failed to reach space as its third stage did not trigger due to a frozen kerosene leak, breaking up in the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. These failures meant neither probe even got to test their newly built fourth stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Nedelin Catastrophe

A few weeks after the Mars failures, a prototype launch for an R-16 missile went disastrously wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. A short circuit caused the second stage engines to fire prematurely, detonating the first stage tanks. This explosion incinerated an unknown number of technicians, and the missile's designer, M.I. Nedelin, was killed, with only his melted golden star and wristwatch found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The horrific event is known as the Nedelin catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Initial Venus Success and Continued Mars Struggles

Despite early Mars failures, Korolev's team launched two Venus probes (1Vs) a few months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The first failed to leave Earth's orbit, but the second successfully entered Venus's orbit, becoming Venera 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Launched on February 12, 1961, Venera 1 was humanity's first true interplanetary spacecraft, though it sent no data back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

Korolev then initiated the 2MV project for Venus and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. [[design_and_challenges_of_soviet_mars_probes|Soviet scientists]] struggled with the Molniya rocket's reliability, facing manufacturing issues in lower stages and challenges with igniting the critical fourth stage in zero gravity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This wasn't unique to the Soviets; the Americans also faced rocket issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Between February 1961 and September 1962, seven straight probes, including two American, failed to reach Venus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

The Soviet program built six 2MV probes, three for the 1962 Mars launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. These probes, weighing around 900 kilograms, carried large cameras and instruments for detecting life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

The first 2MV series probe, 2MV-4 number one (Sputnik 22), launched on October 24, 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Due to the national emergency, Baikonur Spaceport's two launch pads were prioritized for ICBMs, causing tension and delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Although the Mars probe eventually launched, it failed in Earth orbit due to issues with the fourth stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Its debris was initially mistaken by a Wyoming warning station as nuclear missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

Mars 1 (originally 2MV number four or Sputnik 23) launched on November 1, 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. While it successfully separated and unfurled solar panels, a gas engine leak in its orientation system led to a loss of contact on March 21, 1963, months before reaching Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. The silent probe may have photographed Mars but couldn't transmit data back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### The Zond Series and Mariner 4's Impact

Engineering failures in the 2MV series led to improvements in the new Zond series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Two Zond probes were sent to Venus; Zond 1 made it to space but suffered equipment failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. In November 1964, Zond 2, intended for Mars, also experienced fatal onboard failures, including a solar panel failing to unfurl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

This failure was exacerbated by the success of America's Mariner 4, which launched around the same time as Zond 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Mariner 4 flew by Mars in July 1965, sending back 22 photographs covering about one percent of the Martian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. The images revealed a cold, dead world similar to the moon, lacking canals, a magnetic field, and having a very thin atmosphere, which dampened enthusiasm for future Mars missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

### Shifting Priorities: The Moon Race

The Soviet Union recognized America's serious intent to land a man on the Moon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. In August 1964, the Politburo directed Korolev's teams to pursue a manned lunar mission, initiating direct competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. This shift caused managerial chaos and forced changes due to consistent failures in the early 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

Korolev's primary goal became sending a man to the Moon, reducing his capacity for robotic lunar and planetary missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. In March 1965, Mars and Venus probe development was reassigned to a new firm, Lavochkin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Korolev passed away less than a year later in January 1966, an event profoundly felt by the Soviet space program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

## Reorienting the Mars Program (M69)

Mariner 4's findings fundamentally changed the Soviet Mars program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The new team at Lavochkin concluded that the first generation of Mars craft had fundamental flaws, and the previous agency (OKB-1) was spread too thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. They aimed to surpass Mariner 4 by achieving a soft landing on Mars and searching for microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. In October 1965, Soviet leadership decided to reboot the entire program, which meant missing the October 1967 Mars launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

The new project, M69, launched in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. It discarded the old 3MV Zond designs because Mariner 4 showed the Martian atmosphere was too thin for the previous Lander design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. The program received a boost from the new UR-500 "Proton" rocket, originally developed as a super-large ICBM, capable of sending four to five metric tons on an interplanetary trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

The original M69 plan included a Mars Orbiter and Lander for atmospheric studies, soft landings, and microbial searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. Due to time constraints, engineers first tried adapting a lunar design (Year 8) but faced propulsion system issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. In February 1968, Georgi Babakin, the Mars team's engineering head, made the risky decision to scrap the current design and start over, just 13 months before the launch date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

The new design featured a single spherical tank at the center, with an engine at the top, a large antenna, solar panels, and instrumentation packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Mars 69 carried three color cameras and was the first Soviet planetary device with an onboard computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. An entry probe and Lander were initially planned but removed due to weight and testing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. The new design weighed over 5 tons, primarily due to fuel and the inability to shrink instruments without advanced semiconductor technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

The mission plan was complex: a three-stage Proton rocket would take the probes to Earth orbit, then a fourth stage would fire to send them into space, followed by the M69 probe's own engine firings for trajectory adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. This intricate sequence had never been attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

Under immense pressure from the Communist Party, Lavochkin teams worked around the clock, with weekly updates demanded by the Central Committee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. Despite the extraordinary effort, both M69 probes failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. The first (M69A), launched on March 27, 1969, exploded 438 seconds into launch due to a rotor failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. The second (M69B), launched on April 2, 1969, failed at launch when its first-stage engine tilted the rocket, causing it to crash and spew toxic materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. The Proton rocket underwent a major overhaul the following year, which dramatically improved its performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

These failures, coupled with America's Apollo 11 moon landing in July 1969 and the successful Mariner 6 and 7 Mars flybys shortly after, were a bitter defeat for the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

## The 1971 Mars Missions: A New Strategy

Disappointed, the Soviet program looked to the 1971 Mars launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. The M69 failures meant engineers lacked atmospheric data needed for a soft landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. 1971 offered a special orbital window when Earth and Mars were very close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

The program managers decided to send three probes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. The first, Mars 71S (Orbiter), would launch early with extra fuel to reach Mars quickly and measure its atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. Two Landers, Mars 71P (Posadka), would arrive later and use that data for their entry trajectories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

Landing in the thin Martian atmosphere onto unknown ground was the hardest part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. Unlike the Americans, who had detailed atmospheric data and could design controlled gliding entries for Viking, the Soviets lacked this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. They had to use an "uncontrolled ballistic entry" – essentially punching through the atmosphere like a bullet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

The entry probe would be released 46,000 kilometers above Mars, fire engines to assume a 120-degree entry angle, and deploy its parachute at 35 kilometers altitude while traveling at Mach 3.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. This had never been done before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. Tests involved dropping probe models from balloons and rockets, accelerating them with gunpowder engines for parachute deployment tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

The sequence relied heavily on timers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. The probe would drop the Lander, then rockets would fire to carry the parachute and other probe bits away to prevent interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>. Lander models were catapulted onto simulated Martian ground to test their survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. Once settled, the Landers would open to expose instruments, take measurements, and snap pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. A small Soviet rover, Prop-M Marsokhodnik, about 10x10 inches, was designed to "walk" on skis and interact with the soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.

[[political_influences_on_the_soviet_space_program|Political pressure]] persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. The Soviets aimed for Mars 71S to reach Mars first to secure a propaganda victory against the Americans' Mariner 8 and 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. While Mariner 8 failed on May 8, 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>, the Soviet Mars 71S launch on May 9 also failed due to an operator's coding error, setting the fourth stage to fire at 150 hours instead of 1.5 hours, causing it to crash two days later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>.

The two Mars 71P missions launched without incident on May 19 and 21, 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. However, the loss of Mars 71S meant no atmospheric data for calculating entry trajectories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. America's Mariner 9, launched May 30, took a faster trajectory and became the first Orbiter around Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.

In August 1971, Lavochkin chief designer Georgi Babakin died of a heart attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. Mariner 9 then reported a massive dust storm raging across Mars, meaning the Soviet entry probes would attempt landings in its midst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. Without Orbiter data, the probes relied on a backup optical navigation system and an onboard computer that was insufficiently tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

Mars 2, the first Mars 71P Lander, arrived on November 27, 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>. The programs misinterpreted data, causing the entry probe to enter at the wrong angle and crash before parachute deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. It was, however, the first Earth-made object to reach the Martian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.

Mars 3 arrived on December 2, 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. Its optical navigation system worked, and the landing sequence proceeded as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. The Lander settled during the dust storm, opened its petals, and began transmitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. But just 14.5 seconds after starting, the television camera system failed, sending only 79 lines of a single photograph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. The reason for failure is uncertain, possibly electric discharges from dust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. The image was largely noise and not released until the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. The first good image of the Martian surface would not come until the Viking missions in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

Despite the Lander failures, Mars 2 and 3 orbiters continued to conduct science for months, but their findings were overshadowed by Mariner 9's success, which took 7,329 high-quality photographs covering 85 percent of Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>.

## The 1973 Mars Missions and Transistor Flaws

During the Cold War Détente, Nixon and Brezhnev fostered scientific collaboration, including data swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. The Soviets provided data from Mars 2, Mars 3, and Venera 8, while the Americans shared atmospheric data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.

Nevertheless, the space race continued. Knowing America's sophisticated Viking missions were launching in 1975, Soviet leadership planned an "all-out assault" on Mars in the 1973 launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>. The plan evolved from two Orbiter-Landers to two Orbiters (Mars 4 and 5) and two Flyby-Landers (Mars 6 and 7), requiring more speed and fuel due to less ideal 1973 orbital conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

The four spacecraft used largely the same designs as the earlier M71 devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. All four launched without incident in summer 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. However, a critical flaw lurked within: Repeated failures were found in the 2T312 transistors, extensively used throughout all four spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Fabricated in Voronezh, these transistors were supposed to have gold leads, but due to material shortages or cost-cutting, aluminum leads were substituted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. About 1.5 years after production, these transistors began failing at high rates due to corrosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>. Engineers estimated a 50/50 chance of catastrophic failure before mission completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>. The ministry proceeded with the launch due to [[political_influences_on_the_soviet_space_program|political pressure]] and the impending Viking missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.

*   **Mars 4:** Flew by Mars on February 10, 1974, without entering orbit due to a failure in its disproportionate brake system, possibly related to faulty transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. It took some photos before entering solar orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>.
*   **Mars 7:** Reached Mars on March 9, 1974, and released its Lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. However, transistor failures in the Lander's computer systems caused it to miss the planet by about 1,300 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.
*   **Mars 5:** Successfully entered Martian orbit in February 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. A slow pressure leak forced ground control to accelerate its three-month science program to just three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. Mars 5 took 108 high-resolution images of Martian features and studied the atmosphere, detecting water vapor and an ozone layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. The mission was largely considered accomplished despite the pressure leak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.
*   **Mars 6:** Two months after launch, in September 1973, it lost the ability to send telemetry data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. Remarkably, it autonomously measured its position, calculated a correct trajectory, and entered orbit around Mars in March 1974, then released its entry probe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. Ground control learned of its success through a backup radio channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. Sadly, the Lander failed to land safely, with transmission abruptly cutting off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. The cause is unclear, though the probe was falling faster than expected, possibly due to a failed final landing rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.

## Conclusion and Legacy

Despite some scientific gains from the 1973 missions, leadership largely viewed the "all-out assault" on Mars as a failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. The program's chief designer, Vasili Mishin, was dismissed and replaced by Valentin Glushko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>. Glushko pivoted the Soviet space program towards the Buran space shuttle and its Energia launcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>. This meant fewer resources for the Soviet planetary space program, leading to a "War of the Worlds" within the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.

While some still believed fervently in Mars, leadership pragmatically decided to concentrate on Venus, where they had a clear advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. For the next decade, the Soviets mostly launched [[venera_mission_successes_and_impacts|Venera missions]], achieving significant scientific feats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>.

A final push to explore the Martian moon Phobos occurred in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>. Phobos 1 failed to enter Mars orbit due to a faulty command and computer logic error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. Phobos 2 reached Mars and took pictures of the moon, but a malfunctioning computer prevented it from releasing its Lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

The [[soviet_mars_missions_from_1960_to_1973|Soviet Mars program]] was largely defined by its [[comparison_of_soviet_and_american_space_programs|competition with the United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>. This competition ensured substantial resources but also imposed arduous [[political_influences_on_the_soviet_space_program|political requirements]], contributing to failures due to limited launch windows, poor execution, and bad luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>. While their achievements were often eclipsed by the U.S., the Soviet Mars program's efforts to send 15 robots millions of kilometers into space represent an incredible endeavor worthy of admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>.

Starting in the early 2000s, an unusual number of PC motherboards began exhibiting issues with leaking or popping capacitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Victims reported hearing a loud "POP" and noticing a weird, fishy smell, followed by the computer failing to reboot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Upon inspection, the small cylindrical components on the circuit board were found to be swollen or burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This widespread problem became known as the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | Electrolytic Capacitors (E-caps)]] Basics

A capacitor stores electricity, discharging its energy rapidly, sometimes within microseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Its basic structure consists of two electrically conductive plates, called electrodes (anode and cathode), separated by a dielectric material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

[[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | Electrolytic capacitors]], or E-caps, use an electrolyte (solid, gel, or liquid) as the cathode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Typically, an E-cap is made from two strips of aluminum foil with a thin porous paper separator in between, all saturated with the electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The anode foil is coated with aluminum oxide, which serves as the dielectric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. These components are rolled up and sealed in a protective aluminum housing, often with a vent to release built-up gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Aluminum E-caps are widely used due to their good capacitance-to-size and cost efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Manufacturers enhance their performance by etching the aluminum foil to increase electrode surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

E-caps are crucial in devices like PC motherboards (which can have around 60 E-caps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. A primary use is for filtering, smoothing out fluctuating DC power from a rectifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. They also perform "decoupling," absorbing voltage spikes and boosting voltage dips to provide stable power to chips like microprocessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The analogy of [[consequences_of_ignoring_reservoir_maintenance | drainage ponds for floods or dry periods]] has been used to describe their function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Capacitor Aging and Failure Modes

### Natural Aging and Parametric Failure
Being electrochemical components, [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | electrolytic capacitors]] naturally age and corrode, typically having a shorter lifespan (10-20 years) compared to other capacitor types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. A key metric for assessing their condition is Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR), which rises as the capacitor ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Capacitance also gradually declines before a sharper drop-off, indicating a "parametric failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Factors Accelerating Aging
Several factors can accelerate this aging process:
*   **Humidity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>
*   **Heat**: High temperatures can cause the electrolyte to dry out, making cooling recommendations common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Catastrophic Failure
Beyond parametric degradation, capacitors can experience catastrophic failures, such as bulging or exploding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. A bulged capacitor essentially loses capacitance and can cause a short circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. An exploded capacitor can even lead to fires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. These catastrophic failures began to be widely reported in late 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Specific Failure Mechanisms

The widespread failures during the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]] were often attributed to issues with the electrolyte formulation.

### Flawed Electrolyte Formulation
A 2004 report by the Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering at the University of Maryland analyzed bulging capacitors and found that their electrolytes were missing a critical additive known as a "depolarizer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Depolarizers typically help reduce gas generation within the E-cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

The absence of this depolarizer caused the electrolyte in faulty E-caps to become overly alkaline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. This alkalinity, combined with a lack of other protective ions (like phosphate ions) in the aluminum oxide dielectric, led to the dielectric dissolving into the electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. As the dielectric layer thinned, capacitance unnaturally increasedâ€”a leading indicator of bulging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This exposed the underlying aluminum foil, allowing impurities to react and generate free electrons. These electrons then reacted with hydrogen ions in the water-based electrolyte, producing hydrogen gas that caused the capacitor to bulge or rupture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

### Heat from High-Power Microprocessors
An alternative theory for the widespread failures, especially relevant in the mid-2200s, points to the increasing heat generated by microprocessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. The early 2000s saw Intel and AMD aggressively pushing single-core clock rates, leading to power-hungry and very hot chips, such as the infamous Pentium 4 CPUs found in Dell OptiPlex PCs with faulty capacitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

New Low-ESR aluminum E-caps with water-based electrolytes, introduced in the late 1990s to handle these power demands, may have been unable to cope with the extreme temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. This theory suggests that the water-based electrolytes in these capacitors simply boiled, causing gas buildup and container rupture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

The [[impact_of_generational_shifts_in_the_semiconductor_industry | Capacitor Plague]] subsided as AMD and Intel shifted to multi-core CPUs starting in 2005, which lowered internal temperatures. Concurrently, capacitor manufacturers improved their aqueous electrolyte formulations, resolving many of the issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

### [[market_and_supply_chain_issues_affecting_capacitor_production_and_reliability | Supply Chain Complexity and Counterfeits]]
Another contributing factor to capacitor failures is the increasing complexity of the supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. Brands often outsourced to no-name suppliers seeking the cheapest prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

Furthermore, supply chain disruptions can lead to the proliferation of counterfeit capacitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. If legitimate E-caps are delayed, OEMs might turn to unauthorized distributors for cheaper, readily available parts that turn out to be counterfeits, with significantly shorter lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. A 2014 study of counterfeit Nichicon E-caps, found after the 2011 earthquake disrupted the supply chain, revealed that their water-based electrolyte lacked sufficient ethylene glycol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. This deficiency lowered the electrolyte's boiling point, making the capacitor unstable at higher temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

## Conclusion

While theories like the [[industrial_espionage_and_its_impact_on_the_capacitor_industry | Rubycon industrial espionage]] story are often associated with the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]], it is more probable that the widespread capacitor failures stemmed from a complex interplay of factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. These include:

*   **Inherent aging characteristics** of [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | electrolytic capacitors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Environmental stressors** like heat and humidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Fundamental design flaws** in early water-based electrolytes, particularly the omission of vital additives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
*   **Increased thermal stress** from more powerful, hotter microprocessors of the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
*   **[[market_and_supply_chain_issues_affecting_capacitor_production_and_reliability | Supply chain vulnerabilities and the presence of counterfeit components]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

The issue eventually resolved as the industry adapted to new thermal challenges and improved the design and manufacturing of aqueous electrolytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. While concerns about the longevity of aluminum E-caps with water-based electrolytes persist, vendors have largely addressed the major kinks, allowing these essential components to operate reliably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

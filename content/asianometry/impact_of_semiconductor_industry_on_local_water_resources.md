The [[semiconductor_water_usage_and_challenges | semiconductor industry]] faces significant challenges related to water usage, a problem that is projected to worsen over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Industrial and agricultural water consumption far surpasses residential use, and semiconductor manufacturing specifically is a major consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Water Scarcity and Regional Impact
Taiwan, a major hub for semiconductor manufacturing, has experienced severe droughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While northwestern areas like Taipei maintain sufficient reservoirs, regions such as Tainan, Kaohsiung, Taitung, and Hsinchu face water issues due to less resilient infrastructure or higher demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Media reports indicate that TSMC has budgeted millions of dollars to truck water to its fabs in Tainan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Similarly, companies like TSMC and Intel are constructing fabs in Arizona, a state predominantly desert, where 40% of its total water demand is met by non-renewable groundwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. The Colorado River and other surface water sources account for 57% of demand, with reclaimed water supplying the remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. When surface water is insufficient, groundwater is pumped, a practice deemed unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Historically, state governments in the American Southwest have managed water usage by reallocating water from farms to cities, as agriculture consumes nearly 90% of total water demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The conversion of farmland into urban areas has helped reduce overall water usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Ultra Pure Water (UPW) Requirements
A significant portion of water in semiconductor manufacturing is used for washing wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Approximately 30-40% of modern wafer fabrication steps involve some form of wafer cleaning, such as "wet cleaning" to remove organics, metals, and particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Between each washing step, water is used to rinse off chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Semiconductor companies cannot use regular tap water due to particles that could damage the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Instead, they require "ultra pure water" (UPW), a specialized term in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. While UPW is used in other applications like nuclear energy or chemical manufacturing, the semiconductor industry's cleanliness standards are among the strictest, aiming to remove "killer particles" that can affect a chip's nano architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. These particles can include microorganisms, organic matter, dissolved metals, and gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Generating and verifying UPW purity is a complex process involving over a dozen steps, many of which are repeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. It takes about 6,000 liters (1,600 gallons) of city water to produce 3,800 liters (1,000 gallons) of UPW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. A single 200-millimeter (8-inch) wafer can consume over 5,600 liters (2,000 gallons) of UPW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

The type of circuits manufactured also influences water usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Logic circuits, such as microprocessors, are more complex and have more layers than memory ICs, display panels, or solar panels, requiring more water and energy for their production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Increasing Demands of Advanced Nodes
In 2020, TSMC reported that it failed to meet its water consumption goals set years prior, achieving only a 5% reduction in liters of water consumed per 8-inch wafer equivalent layer, against a target of 27% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This shortfall was attributed to increased demands for process cleanliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The more advanced a process node, the greater its water requirement, necessitating more layers to wash, more UPW, and stricter UPW standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. With each new process node, the threshold for a "killer particle" shrinks, making it harder to remove contaminants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Consequently, today's cutting-edge chips demand more water to fabricate than those from 10 years ago, despite advances in [[water_recycling_and_reuse_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | water reuse]] and conservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This trend is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Wastewater Generation and Treatment
Semiconductor manufacturing processes generate substantial amounts of wastewater that require treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. In 2013, TSMC's fabs in Tainan alone produced 19 million tons of wastewater, compared to the entire city's 29 million tons in the same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

Wastewater from wet washing contains high levels of pollutants like ammonia, phosphate, and fluoride, which have been linked to health concerns for semiconductor workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Different types of wastewater necessitate varying levels of treatment, some requiring more expensive and extensive methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Large foundries separate these streams and apply specific treatments for over 25 different chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Water Recycling and Conservation Efforts
Some of the treated wastewater is reusable and can be reintroduced into the system to generate more UPW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Non-reusable water is often directed to cooling towers where it evaporates to help maintain fab temperatures, which is the single largest use of energy and water in these facilities after direct manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

Implementing such a system is complex and costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Smaller companies often find it more cost-effective to broadly treat aggregated wastewater and return it to the city once it meets minimum health and safety standards, then obtain new raw water from the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

Large fabs like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel are compelled to adopt [[water_recycling_and_reuse_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | water reuse and recycling technologies]] due to their immense scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. TSMC's recycle rate in 2017 was 87%, significantly higher than the average semiconductor fab's rate of 42% in a 2017 Singapore study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

In 2019, TSMC's fabs in Tainan alone consumed 50,000 metric tons (50 million liters) of water daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. To manage this demand and avoid depleting local supplies, TSMC optimizes its water draw and usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This includes building large rain collection systems with 700-ton tanks to capture and store rainwater for landscaping or discharge to sewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The company has also initiated tenders for water reclamation plants near its fabs, which will recycle industrial wastewater using advanced methods like reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration, similar to Singapore's "New Water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The first facilities are in Tainan Science Park, with more reclaimed water capacity planned for the coming years in other Tainan areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## Economic Incentives vs. Water Scarcity
Despite the water challenges, placing semiconductor fabs in arid regions like Arizona makes [[economic_incentives_for_semiconductor_fabs_in_waterscarce_regions | economic sense]] due to the highly profitable nature of high-volume semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. States are willing to absorb costs, including building water infrastructure or reallocating existing water supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. A 2012 paper on Chandler, Arizona, found that the economic benefits from semiconductor manufacturing outweighed the costs of water provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Governments receive significantly more revenue per acre from semiconductor manufacturing than from other land uses, largely through property taxation, incentivizing them to attract these facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

Additionally, the industry's wealth allows it to invest in advanced water saving, reusing, and recycling techniques, theoretically returning a high percentage of water to the wastewater system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. This makes other advantages of Arizona, such as a supply of educated talent, tax incentives, and seismic stability, outweigh the simple lack of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

However, this often leads to water allocations being cut for farmers and diverted to tech companies in both Taiwan and Arizona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. While agriculture is the primary water user globally, there is an argument that traditional agricultural practices are not economically efficient uses of precious water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Nonetheless, reallocating water from farmers carries significant political consequences, requiring governments to delicately balance these interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

The semiconductor industry's demand for water is expected to persist as Moore's Law drives continued technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Therefore, ongoing innovation in water recycling, reduction, and reuse technologies is crucial to prevent future water shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

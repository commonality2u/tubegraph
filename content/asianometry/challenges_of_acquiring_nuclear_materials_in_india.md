India, despite being one of the first countries to advocate for a global ban on nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, became the sixth declared nuclear power on May 18, 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The nation's journey to the atomic bomb involved significant challenges, particularly in securing the necessary nuclear materials.

## Natural Resource Limitations

India possesses abundant thorium but limited uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Thorium is non-fissile, meaning it cannot sustain a nuclear chain reaction on its own, though it can be converted into fissile uranium-233 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This necessitated a long-term strategy, later articulated by [[role_of_dr_homi_bhabha_in_indias_nuclear_development | Dr. Homi Bhabha]] as a three-step plan, leveraging thorium with plutonium and uranium-233 byproducts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

## Securing Domestic Sources: The Travancore Challenge

One of the early challenges in India’s nuclear history was acquiring and controlling its thorium sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The Travancore principality, indirectly ruled by the United Kingdom, was rich in rare earth ores like monazite, which contained trace amounts of thorium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This was India's only known source of nuclear ore at the time, though uranium ores were found later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

The Travancore government had historically used its monazite reserves to bolster its sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. In January 1947, its Dewar (prime minister), Sir CP Ramaswami Aiyar, struck a three-year deal with the British for monazite access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The Indian government exerted significant pressure on Travancore to join the union, with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru even considering the use of air power in April 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Eventually, Travancore's ruler overruled his Dewar, and India secured its nuclear ores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## International Acquisition Efforts and Obstacles

India sought to leverage its supply of thorium and other strategic minerals internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Engaging with France and the US
Early agreements were struck with France in 1948 and 1950 for a monazite processing plant and joint research on beryllium-moderated reactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. While the latter was the first bilateral international nuclear project after World War II, its benefits to India’s atomic program were limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

[[role_of_dr_homi_bhabha_in_indias_nuclear_development | Dr. Bhabha]] also reached out to the American Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) chairman, Gordon Dean, in 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. He proposed a trade:
> "All declassified information on reactor theory, design and technology ... we should be glad to have the detailed designs of such reactors that have been completely declassified, together with all operational data that may have been obtained concerning them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>

In return, India would provide 10 tons of heavy water, thorium ore, uranium ore, and possibly beryllium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Despite strained relations due to India's non-alignment policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, the global rush for strategic nuclear-relevant ores compelled the Americans to the negotiating table, as securing these materials for themselves meant denying them to Communist countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Geopolitical Interference and Export Control
India faced challenges due to Cold War geopolitics. The Americans were wary of India deepening ties with the Soviets, especially after [[chinas_indigenous_nuclear_weapon_development | China's indigenous nuclear weapon development | China's]] civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

A significant incident occurred in July 1953 when the US Embassy discovered an Indian state-owned enterprise was shipping 2 tons of thorium nitrate to Tianjin, [[chinas_indigenous_nuclear_weapon_development | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The Eisenhower Administration scrambled, as America's Mutual Defense Act mandated terminating aid to countries trading embargoed items with Communist nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Nehru bristled at the US dictating India's trade partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. It took "substantial behind-the-scenes work" for the Americans to purchase the thorium at an inflated price to prevent its delivery to [[chinas_indigenous_nuclear_weapon_development | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This incident highlighted the challenges India faced in maintaining autonomy over its nuclear materials in a globally charged environment.

Furthermore, Pakistan's courting of the Americans a year later, emphasizing anti-Communist sympathies, deepened India's antipathy towards the US and complicated material acquisition efforts by creating regional rivalries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

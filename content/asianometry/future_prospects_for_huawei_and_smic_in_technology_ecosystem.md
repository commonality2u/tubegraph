In late August 2023, Huawei quietly began selling phones featuring its own chips again [00:00:02]. The Huawei Mate 60 Pro, which went on sale in its online store, includes the Kirin 9000s (麒麟9000s), a 7-nanometer class chip [00:00:10], [00:00:16]. While Huawei did not explicitly state the manufacturer, it is widely believed to be [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | SMIC]] [00:00:23], [00:00:26].

## The Kirin 9000s Chip

The Kirin 9000s is a 107 square millimeter die, approximately 2% larger than the Kirin 9000 and Kirin 9000E, which were Huawei's previous leading-edge chips [00:01:40], [00:01:45]. These earlier chips were briefly produced using [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC's]] 5-nanometer process before American sanctions ended that collaboration [00:01:54], [00:01:59].

The current 7-nanometer class chip is estimated to be about 5-6 years behind the leading edge, as [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]] has been shipping 3-nanometer class chips in 2023 [00:02:03], [00:02:09]. Teardowns and speed tests indicate the Kirin 9000s supports 5G connectivity, though Huawei appears to be concealing this functionality, not mentioning 5G support in press releases and having the phone OS report 4G on the surface [00:02:15], [00:02:22], [00:02:27]. The SoC's CPU core is a customization of [[the_significance_of_arm_and_riscv_in_chinas_semiconductor_industry | Arm IP]], and the GPU seems to be a new custom design by Huawei or HiSilicon [00:02:49], [00:02:55].

### Production and Yields

Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis suggested that [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | SMIC's]] early yields for this node are likely "far higher than we expect" [00:03:09], [00:03:12]. Yields typically start low but improve as the fab refines its processes [00:03:17]. For example, [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]] scaled its N7 yields sufficiently to support an iPhone launch, and the same is expected for [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | SMIC]]. Increased sales of Huawei phones will accelerate this improvement [00:03:23], [00:03:26]. The 7nm chip is confirmed to be real, and the manufacturing node appears to be "really, really good" [00:03:40].

News of [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | SMIC's N+2 process]] first emerged in July 2022, when it was used for Bitcoin miners, which are good test cases due to their repetitive structures [00:04:20], [00:04:26], [00:04:29]. A phone SoC like the Kirin 9000s is a much more complex chip to produce [00:04:36], [00:04:41]. The success in producing it demonstrates the significant progress made by Co-CEO Liang Mong-song and [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | SMIC]] in about a year [00:04:47].

## Future Prospects for Advanced Chips

It is anticipated that even more advanced chips will emerge [00:04:54]. Dr. Burn Lin, former [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]] R&D director, stated in January 2022 that [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | SMIC]] could fabricate 5-nanometer class chips using only multi-patterning [00:04:58], [00:05:05], [00:05:09].

Immersion lithography, although 1-2 decades old, remains a key technology [00:05:15], [00:05:18]. While the United States banned EUV lithography exports, 193-nanometer immersion machines like the Twinscan NXT 2000i are still crucial, performing 70-80% of lithography work for Intel, [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]], and Samsung in their latest nodes [00:05:26], [00:05:31], [00:05:42], [00:05:48], [00:05:52].

The US administration initially held back on a 193i ban due to concerns about cooperation from Japan and the Netherlands [00:05:58], [00:06:03]. These nations joined the export restrictions on June 30, 2023 [00:06:09], [00:06:12]. Despite this, [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | SMIC]] still possesses many of these machines, enabling them to scale 7-nanometer production and potentially move to 5-nanometer [00:06:25], [00:06:29], [00:06:33]. It is fully expected that a 5-nanometer class Huawei chip will emerge in 1-2 years [00:06:40], [00:06:45].

### Emergence of a China-Only Supply Line

The Mate 60 Pro represents more than just a high-performing chip; it is embedded within an ecosystem of domestic Chinese suppliers [00:06:58], [00:07:01]. These suppliers have collectively created a phone that achieves feature-parity with the market [00:07:06]. With the exception of memory, which appears to be from SK Hynix, the entire phone is effectively a China-only ecosystem [00:07:20], [00:07:25].

This indicates the groundwork for a complete, self-contained ecosystem within the People's Republic of China, capable of producing various domestic electronics, including smartphone SoCs, CPUs, edge AI NPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators [00:07:31], [00:07:35], [00:07:41].

### Impact and Future Strategic Moves

The success of a 7-nanometer phone chip, while seemingly five years behind the leading edge [00:07:49], [00:07:51], will have significant implications for Qualcomm, Apple, and MediaTek [00:07:54], [00:07:58]. Qualcomm's sales of tens of millions of chips for Huawei phones are likely to be replaced by the Kirin 9000s and similar domestic chips [00:08:05], [00:08:08]. [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | SMIC]] is expected to be busy fulfilling Huawei orders for the next year [00:08:18], [00:08:20].

Looking forward, [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | SMIC]] is expected to seek new [[economic_competitiveness_of_smics_nplus2_node | N+2 node customers]] in high-powered computing, aiming to find partners for domestic AI accelerators akin to Nvidia's A100 or TPUs [00:08:23], [00:08:31], [00:08:35]. A Chinese 7-nanometer AI accelerator is anticipated within 1-2 years, potentially designed by companies like Biren, Baidu, Alibaba Cloud, or Tencent, barring further sanctions [00:08:38], [00:08:45].

## China's Next Steps

China is actively building its native semiconductor and technology ecosystem, which is "real" and deserving of praise, especially given the impact of sanctions [00:08:55], [00:08:58].

The primary goal from a semiconductor manufacturing perspective should be to widely distribute the Mate 60 Pro phone to maximize scale [00:09:05], [00:09:08], [00:09:14]. Selling millions of units to Chinese domestic consumers, as well as to Europeans, Australians, Southeast Asians, and Latin Americans, is crucial [00:09:18], [00:09:22]. Although Huawei phones lack Google products, efforts are underway to educate consumers on how to integrate them [00:09:27], [00:09:30], [00:09:33].

Every export sale not only impacts Western phone makers but also strengthens [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | SMIC]] [00:09:39], [00:09:46]. Increased chip production by [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | SMIC]] accelerates yield improvement, profitability, and funding for the move to 5-nanometer [00:09:46], [00:09:51], [00:09:57].

[[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | SMIC]] should also review and replicate advanced packaging technology [00:09:57], [00:10:00]. While phone chips emphasize thinness and heat, requiring Chip Scale Packaging, advanced AI applications demand new packaging architectures like chiplets and 2.5D die-stacking for data bandwidth [00:10:03], [00:10:09], [00:10:13], [00:10:17].

The Chinese Government will also need to strengthen its domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment ecosystem, aiming to replace foreign suppliers like ASML, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, Lam Research, and metrology companies, as foreign equipment likely contains "kill switches" [00:10:24], [00:10:26], [00:10:31], [00:10:36], [00:10:39].

## US Response and [[impact_of_us_export_bans_on_smic | Implications of Chinese Semiconductor Advancements]]

The US Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security justified restrictions on foreign support for "advanced semiconductors" (16/14nm or below) due to their implications for military modernization, including WMD development, and human rights abuses [00:11:01], [00:11:06], [00:11:12], [00:11:19], [00:11:23], [00:11:27], [00:11:32]. US intelligence indicates that China's ability to manufacture advanced logic chips significantly impacts the regional military balance of power [00:11:37], [00:11:40], [00:11:44].

Given the progress by [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | SMIC]] and Huawei, if the US government perceives a Chinese 7-nanometer node as a national security threat, it may intensify efforts to halt it [00:11:49], [00:11:54], [00:11:57]. This would require a better understanding of remaining foreign semiconductor manufacturing equipment flows, as domestic Chinese suppliers are still years behind [00:12:03], [00:12:07], [00:12:11].

Currently, equipment companies like Applied, Lam Research, Tokyo Electron, and KLA can sell most of their tools for deposition, etch, metrology, and epitaxy, which are ostensibly for lagging-edge 28nm nodes but can also be used for 7nm and even 5nm production [00:12:16], [00:12:22], [00:12:26], [00:12:35]. These tools are likely being repurposed to make chips like the Kirin 9000s [00:12:41].

To prevent China from developing leading-edge capacity at scale, the US government, in cooperation with allies, should consider tighter export controls on tools currently being repurposed, such as Argon Fluoride Immersion lithography, mask, and CMP equipment, and restrict the use of licenses for firms like [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | SMIC]] on the entity list [00:12:47], [00:12:52], [00:12:58], [00:13:04], [00:13:08].

The development of the Kirin 9000s is seen as a significant "visible mark on technology history," akin to Samsung's 1986 achievement of closing the Korean-Japanese semiconductor gap [00:13:18], [00:13:22], [00:13:26], [00:13:43], [00:13:49]. The People's Republic of China is adopting a similar approach to semiconductor manufacturing that proved successful for South Korea, and it appears to be working for China as well [00:13:54], [00:13:58].

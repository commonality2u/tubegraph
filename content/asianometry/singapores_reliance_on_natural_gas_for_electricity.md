Singapore relies heavily on natural gas for its electricity generation, with 95% of its power coming from this source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The island nation has few alternatives due to its small size, which limits the space available for extensive solar or wind farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While some residential buildings feature rooftop solar panels, this contribution is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Addressing Energy Needs with Imported Renewables

To reduce its dependence on natural gas and meet future energy demands, Singapore is exploring options to import electricity from overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. A significant initiative aimed at this goal is the [[australia_asean_power_link_and_sun_cable_megaproject | Australia-ASEAN Power Link]], also known as the "Sun Cable" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This mega-project, developed by a Singaporean company, intends to transmit renewable solar energy from Australia to Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

The Sun Cable project proposes a 10-gigawatt capacity solar farm spanning 12,000 hectares in Australia's Northern Territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The electricity generated would first travel 500 miles (800 kilometers) to Darwin, with the remainder exported to Singapore via an intercontinental 2,300-mile (3,700 kilometers) HVDC underwater power line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Once fully operational, the Sun Cable is projected to supply up to 20% of Singapore's energy requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. The project is currently in the planning stages and is scheduled to come online around 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

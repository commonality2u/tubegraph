The [[smics_7nm_chip_production | SMIC N+2]] node is a [[smics_7nm_process_and_semiconductor_manufacturing | 7 nanometer process node]] that represents a significant leap forward for the Chinese semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Technical Details and Capabilities
The N+2 node is a descendant of SMIC's N+1 process, which was first "taped out" in October 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Both the N+1 and N+2 nodes utilize DUV (deep ultraviolet) immersion lithography with multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. While the N+2 node is technically capable of using EUV (extreme ultraviolet) technology, the United States has imposed an export ban on this technology, blocking SMIC's roadmap in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### "7 Nanometer" Definition
The term "7 nanometer" in process node numbers is primarily a marketing device, indicating an improvement in power, performance, or area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. It does not correspond to a specific physical dimension but suggests that the chips are 70% better than the previous 10 nanometer generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. For context, [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]] refers to their equivalent node as N7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Comparison to Global Leaders
Semi-analysis and Tech Insights have noted that SMIC's N+2 is "very similar" to [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC's N7]] â€” "like 99% the same" in physical measurements of transistors, finfets, and their placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

[[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]] first shipped N7 chips in high volume in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This means that an N7-equivalent node reaching high volume production would place SMIC approximately four to six years behind the leading edge of [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | global semiconductor leaders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Despite this gap, N+2 is considered one of the most advanced processes made available by any foundry to its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Yield and Manufacturing Challenges
While it's possible to produce chips at advanced nodes like N5 equivalent using only multi-patterning (without EUV), the critical issue is whether these nodes can yield in meaningful quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. For instance, [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | Samsung]] has struggled with yields for their advanced process nodes, and [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | Intel]] famously faced difficulties transitioning from their 10nm to 7nm equivalent nodes without EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

However, [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]] successfully ramped up N7 without significant reported issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Given the similarity between SMIC's N+2 and [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC's N7]], it is expected that N+2 will follow a similar yield optimization curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Economic Viability
The economic competitiveness of N+2 without EUV is a key question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. In an open market, a foundry using EUV would possess economic advantages over those relying solely on DUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. An N7-equivalent node made with only multi-patterning also imposes significant design restrictions on chip designers due to manufacturing limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

In an open market, SMIC's N+2 is unlikely to be [[economic_challenges_in_the_mems_industry | economically viable]] as [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]] offers a better-performing N7 equivalent in their N6, which is an evolution of N7 and equipped with EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Domestic Chinese Market Focus
SMIC may be anticipating N+2 to be a China-only product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The N+2 node is so similar to [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC's N7]] that it likely involves trade secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. In the past, [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]] successfully obtained product import bans on SMIC products made with their trade secrets in 2002 and 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. If [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]] were to pursue this again, it could eliminate N+2's viability as an export product, limiting its use to domestic Chinese products or exports to "friendly countries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. While SMIC does value export capability, they may no longer depend on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

The Chinese chip design industry has advanced significantly, and the Chinese electronics industry has matured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. HiSilicon, Huawei's chip design arm and formerly China's largest semiconductor company, is a strong candidate to utilize N+2 for high-performing Chinese mobile processors and server chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. HiSilicon was a flagship customer of [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]], fabricating chips like the Kirin 980/985/990 series on N7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

The partnership between HiSilicon and SMIC could bring significant production volumes, which are crucial for foundries to scale and yield-optimize their process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. With sufficient volume, N+2 is expected to improve over time, similar to how [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]] became proficient at N7 before EUV became widely available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Impact of US Export Bans
The United States has long blocked the export of advanced EUV machines to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Recently, there have been efforts to push the Netherlands (ASML) and Japan (Nikon) to prevent the export of DUV immersion lithography machines to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This timing may not be a coincidence with the N+2 shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

Immersion machines, which use water to improve resolution, are workhorses of modern semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. A ban on 193 nanometer immersion lithography technology, without a corresponding ban on dry ARF technology (which seems unfeasible), is estimated to add four to six years to SMIC's progress towards the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

Such a ban would likely stimulate substantial investment in Chinese-made lithography, focusing first on maintaining existing equipment and second on facilitating the dry-to-immersion transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. While it's debatable if Chinese companies could fully match ASML or Nikon in complete systems (a gap of several years), it's not insurmountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Conclusion
A legitimate [[smics_7nm_chip_production | 7 nanometer node]] at high volume and good yield represents a triumph for China's advanced manufacturing industry, as only three other companies have reached this level of scale and sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Any successful immersion ban would not permanently damage China's progress but could maintain or slightly expand the Sino-American semiconductor gap for a few valuable years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. The situation highlights the need for American semiconductor companies to continue innovating and improving, rather than solely relying on government intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

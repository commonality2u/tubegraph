Starting in the early 2000s, an abnormal number of PC motherboards experienced issues with leaking or popping capacitors, a phenomenon often referred to as the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Users reported loud pops and a fishy smell, leading to computer failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Upon inspection, small cylinders on the boards were often found swollen or burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## What is a Capacitor?

A capacitor is an electronic component that stores electricity, similar to a battery, but it discharges its electrical energy in a very short period, sometimes within microseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The term "capacitor" is conceptually similar to components found in DRAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Basic Structure
The basic [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors | structure of a capacitor]] consists of two electrically conductive plates, known as electrodes (anode and cathode), separated by a material called the dielectric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Electrolytic Capacitors (E-caps)

Electrolytic capacitors, often abbreviated as E-caps, are a common type of capacitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Components and Materials
E-caps derive their name from the electrolyte they contain, which serves as the capacitorâ€™s cathode or negative electrode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This electrolyte can be a solid, gel, or liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

A typical aluminum E-cap is constructed from:
*   **Electrodes** Two strips of aluminum foil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Separator Layer** A very thin layer of porous paper or tissue placed between the foil strips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This paper and the gap between the foil strips are saturated with the electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Dielectric** The positive electrode (anode foil) is coated with a layer of aluminum oxide, which acts as the dielectric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Housing** The entire assembly is rolled up and sealed in a protective housing, typically made from aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The seal prevents the electrolyte from drying out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. A vent may be present at the top to release built-up gas and prevent explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Charge Storage (Capacitance)
Aluminum E-caps are widely used due to their good capacitance (ability to hold a lot of charge) for their size and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
A capacitor's ability to hold charge is:
*   **Correlated** to the surface area of its electrodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Inversely correlated** to the distance between the electrodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Manufacturers enhance performance by:
*   Using thin separator paper to minimize the dielectric's thickness, allowing electrodes to be as close as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   Etching the aluminum foil to increase the electrodes' surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Types of E-caps
While various types of capacitors exist, including electrolytic capacitors made with Tantalum, Aluminum E-caps are notably common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Uses of E-caps

PC motherboards can contain around 60 E-caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Their primary uses include:
*   **Filtering** In power supply modules, capacitors smooth out fluctuating DC power from a rectifier, charging when voltage peaks and discharging when it dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Decoupling** They smooth out power supply fluctuations going to chips like microprocessors, absorbing voltage spikes and boosting voltage dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This is likened to drainage ponds for floods or dry periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

E-caps are not limited to PC motherboards; they are also found in camcorders, VCRs, televisions, stereos, and LCD screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## E-cap Industry

The aluminum E-cap industry is a multi-billion dollar sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. In 2002, it was valued at approximately $3 to $3.5 billion, growing to an estimated $5 to $6 billion today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Suppliers are predominantly Japanese, Taiwanese, or Chinese, producing billions of units annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. In 2002, Taiwan alone produced 22.5 billion E-caps, accounting for 30% of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## E-cap Failure Modes

Electrolytic capacitors are electrochemical in nature, causing them to age and corrode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. They generally have shorter natural lifespans (about 10-20 years) compared to other capacitor types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Parametric Failure
Aging capacitors experience a rise in Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) and a slow decline in capacitance before a sharp drop at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This is a parametric failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
Factors accelerating aging include:
*   **Humidity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Heat** High temperatures can cause the electrolyte to dry up, hence the recommendation to keep them cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Catastrophic Failure
Capacitors can also experience catastrophic failure, leading to bulged or exploded components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. A bulged capacitor loses capacitance and can cause a short circuit, while an exploded one may even lead to fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This type of failure became prevalent in the early 2000s, contributing to the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### Role of Electrolyte Formulation
The electrolyte is a critical trade secret, influencing the capacitor's operating conditions, temperature, voltage, and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. These are complex chemical formulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

A report from the University of Maryland's Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering in 2004 indicated that bulging capacitors' electrolytes often lacked a "depolarizer" additive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. The absence of a depolarizer caused the electrolyte to become more alkaline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This alkalinity, combined with the dielectric's lack of protective phosphate ions, led to the dissolution of the aluminum oxide dielectric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

The dielectric becoming thinner caused capacitance to rise abnormally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This exposed the underlying aluminum foil, where impurities reacted to create spare electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. These electrons then reacted with hydrogen ions in the water-based electrolyte, producing hydrogen gas that caused the E-caps to rupture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

### Factors Contributing to Failures
While a story of industrial espionage involving a defector from Rubycon and a flawed electrolyte formula circulated widely as the cause of the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, it is likely that the "Plague" was a result of several unconnected challenges within the capacitor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

Possible contributing factors include:
*   **Increased Heat from Microprocessors** New Low-ESR aluminum E-caps with water-based electrolytes, introduced in the late 1990s, were used to handle increasingly power-hungry and hot microprocessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. The heat from chips like the Intel Pentium 4 could cause these water-based electrolytes to boil, generating gas and popping the containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.
*   **Supply Chain Complexity and Counterfeits** The increasing complexity of the supply chain led to brand-name companies outsourcing parts to no-name suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Delays in legitimate supply could lead OEMs to purchase counterfeit capacitors, which would not last as long as genuine ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. A 2014 study of counterfeit Nichicon E-caps found they lacked sufficient ethylene glycol, lowering their boiling point and making them unstable at higher temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

The transition to multi-core CPUs by AMD and Intel starting in 2005 reduced internal temperatures, and capacitor-makers improved their aqueous electrolytes, effectively ending widespread issues like the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

Despite past challenges and ongoing longevity concerns, aluminum E-caps with water-based electrolytes continue to offer the best capacitance for their size and price, with vendors largely having worked out the kinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

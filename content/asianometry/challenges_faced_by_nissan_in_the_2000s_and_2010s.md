Nissan's history has been characterized by significant fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. By late 2024, the company's struggles had led to a proposed merger with Honda, described as more of a takeover arranged by the Japanese government to rescue a "spiraling company left behind by the times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This recent downturn reflects a series of challenges Nissan faced throughout the 2000s and 2010s.

## Early Struggles and Carlos Ghosn's Initial Turnaround

Before [[carlos_ghosns_impact_on_nissan | Carlos Ghosn]] joined Nissan in 1999 as COO, the company was in a dire state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Years of excessive global expansion, foreign assimilation, and lax management had resulted in uneconomical factories, operating at only 53% utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Its vehicle lineup was poor, with only 4 out of over 40 lines being profitable, and its workforce was unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. The market was highly skeptical, with some analysts suggesting Nissan "shouldn't even be in the auto business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

[[carlos_ghosns_impact_on_nissan | Ghosn]], known as "Le Cost Killer," implemented aggressive strategies to cut costs and pay off debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. These included simplifying the company's complex portfolio of cross-stock holdings, halving its supplier network to reduce inflated prices, and shaking up the employee incentive structure by promoting younger talent over seniority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. Most controversially from a Japanese cultural perspective, his revival plan involved cutting 21,000 jobs and closing five factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. These efforts yielded significant savings and led to Nissan's return to profitability by 2002, ahead of schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

A key part of [[carlos_ghosns_impact_on_nissan | Ghosn]]'s growth strategy was tapping the burgeoning Chinese automotive market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. In 2000, Nissan formed a joint venture (JV) called Fengshen Auto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. However, this new JV faced a rocky start, with initial setups reversing responsibilities (Chinese workers in production, Japanese in sales) and leading to a 10% sales decrease in 2004, necessitating a restructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. Despite this, Dongfeng Nissan's sales eventually exploded 160% in 2005, making it China's fastest-growing carmaker that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

## Looming Clouds and Industry Shifts

Throughout the 2000s, Nissan encountered significant short-term and long-term challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>:

### Short-Term Economic Shocks
*   **Global Financial Crisis (2008)**: Sales plummeted by 22%, leading to a $2.9 billion net loss in 2009 and thousands of job cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.
*   **March 2011 Earthquake**: This devastating natural disaster damaged factories and disrupted global supply chains, forcing the Japanese auto industry, including Nissan, to work intensely to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

### Long-Term Industry Developments
[[carlos_ghosns_impact_on_nissan | Ghosn]] correctly identified major industry-wide shifts that would fundamentally alter the automotive landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. These included:
*   **Rising R&D Costs**: Stricter safety and environmental regulations demanded significant investment in areas like fuel efficiency, new safety equipment, and lighter, stronger car bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. These increasing fixed costs necessitated higher sales volumes to achieve a good return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.
*   **Need for Consolidation**: With nearly half of development costs going towards features customers didn't differentiate on, carmaker consolidation became crucial to share these expenses and free up resources for customer-valued innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. [[carlos_ghosns_impact_on_nissan | Ghosn]] believed the Renault-Nissan alliance had the potential to compete with giants like VW, Toyota, or GM by aiming for 10 million annual car sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

## "Unhealthy Growth" Strategies (Post-2011)
In pursuit of aggressive sales targets, Nissan adopted strategies that proved detrimental to its brand and long-term health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>:
*   **Deep Discounts**: Nissan offered significant discounts, averaging 16.7% by 2018, higher than the industry's 10% average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Dealer Incentives**: "Stair step" incentives provided large cash bonuses for hitting ambitious sales quotas but nothing for falling short. This "grow or go" mentality made bonuses rare as quotas ratcheted up, leading to desperate or disgruntled dealers, many of whom left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Fleet Sales**: Selling more cars to rental fleets, which accumulate high mileage before resale, disrupted the resale value of Nissan's models for all other customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

These actions exemplified a "growth at all costs" approach, which ultimately damaged brand value, alienated dealers, and worried consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>.

## Missed Opportunities and Stagnant Lineup
Nissan's product lineup also began to stagnate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>. As American tastes shifted towards SUVs and trucks in the late 2000s and early 2010s due to cheaper gas, Nissan's core sedan lines fell out of favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. While they introduced products with potential, execution was often lacking:
*   **Nissan Titan Pickup Truck**: Introduced in 2003 to challenge Ford and GM, it proved tough to manufacture, its design went stale, and sales consistently fell short of [[carlos_ghosns_impact_on_nissan | Ghosn]]'s targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.
*   **Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Self-Driving**: Nissan was an EV pioneer with the Leaf and [[carlos_ghosns_impact_on_nissan | Ghosn]] foresaw self-driving technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. However, execution was poor; the Nissan Leaf and Renault ZOE, both EVs developed simultaneously, had almost nothing in common, including their batteries, making them too expensive for general consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. This resulted in lost time and momentum in a crucial emerging market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>.

## Simmering Tensions within the Alliance
Despite [[carlos_ghosns_impact_on_nissan | Ghosn]]'s push for closer integration within the Renault-Nissan alliance, cultural and geopolitical tensions simmered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>. Engineers resisted forced collaboration and common platforms, feeling it compromised car identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.

Nissan also perceived the shareholding arrangement as uneven, with Renault having voting power over Nissan but not vice versa, and felt Nissan was increasingly propping up the smaller French company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>. These tensions were exacerbated by the French government's intervention in 2015, which threatened Nissan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>.

## Leadership and [[management_and_strategic_changes_at_nissan_postghosn | Management and Strategic Changes at Nissan Post-Ghosn]] Challenges
[[carlos_ghosns_impact_on_nissan | Ghosn]]'s long tenure (nearly 20 years) and his handpicked board meant there was no credible successor, creating a vacuum when he was arrested in November 2018 on charges of underreporting income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. His abrupt departure and subsequent escape from Japan destabilized the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>. His immediate successor also resigned due to stock pay violations, further complicating [[management_and_strategic_changes_at_nissan_postghosn | Nissan's management and strategic changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>.

From 2019 to 2021, Nissan struggled, enduring significant revenue losses while cutting jobs, closing factories, reducing incentives, and mending dealer relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>. A major challenge was renegotiating the unequal shareholding relationship with Renault, a process fraught with toxicity, internal infighting, and leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>. The deal, sealed in 2023, trimmed Renault's stake and gave Nissan voting rights for its Renault shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:00">[19:13:00]</a>.

## Rise of Chinese EVs and Future Uncertainty
A critical challenge emerging in the 2010s, and intensifying into the 2020s, was the rapid rise of Chinese EV companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>. These companies, operating like consumer electronics firms within a powerful EV ecosystem, produced innovative products at high speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:26:00">[20:26:00]</a>.

Nissan's joint ventures in China, like Dongfeng Nissan, struggled to keep pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>. In 2023, Nissan's Chinese sales fell by 30%, with similar declines projected for 2024, and factory utilization in China (Nissan's top market) dropped to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>. This struggle in a key market, combined with ongoing [[management_and_strategic_changes_at_nissan_postghosn | management and strategic changes]] and internal disputes with Renault, created further instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:22:00">[22:22:00]</a>.

The proposed merger with Honda in late 2024 is a direct response to these accumulated challenges, particularly the looming threat of companies like Foxconn sniffing around Nissan, and Nissan's internal issues, such as an aging product lineup and a lopsided cost situation where Japan accounts for a disproportionate share of the workforce relative to car production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>. Honda's reluctance to fully embrace Nissan's problems further underscores the severity of the challenges Nissan faces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>.

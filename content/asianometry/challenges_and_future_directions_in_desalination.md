## Current State of Desalination
[[Water scarcity and desalination in the Gulf region | Over 65% of the world's desalination water capacity is located in the Gulf region]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman are among the most water-stressed globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. These nations have less than 100 cubic meters of renewable freshwater per person annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, and existing surface water is often contaminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Intense groundwater exploitation further exacerbates issues, leading to consequences like land subsidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Rapidly rising populations and increasing agricultural water demand also contribute to the reliance on desalination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Challenges in Desalination
The primary [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | desalination technologies]] used globally, [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | Multi-Stage Flash (MSF)]] and [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | Reverse Osmosis (RO)]], face several significant challenges.

### Energy Intensity
[[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | MSF]] is a massively energy-intensive process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. It typically requires 10 to 25 kilowatt-hours or more to produce one cubic meter of desalted water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. While pairing these plants with existing power stations can cut energy consumption by 50% by utilizing byproduct heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, the energy demands remain daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. For instance, in 2014, Saudi Arabia's cogeneration plants consumed 1.5 million barrels of oil daily, representing 15% of its oil production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Without substantial [[Energy Sources for Desalination | energy reserves]] and subsidies, these large-scale [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | MSF plants]] would likely not be economical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### Salt Scaling and Fouling
For [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | MSF plants]], "Salt Scaling" is a primary concern. Over time, calcium and magnesium salts precipitate on heat exchanger tubes, reducing heat transfer efficiency and necessitating lengthy cleaning processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Operators use methods like maintaining specific brine temperatures, de-carbonation, and adding scale inhibitor chemicals (e.g., phosphates) to mitigate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

[[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | SWRO]] faces a similar challenge with membrane fouling. Silt, algae, jellyfish swarms, and dissolved organic material can foul the membranes, requiring extensive pre-treatment of the incoming seawater with screens, sand filters, and chemicals like chlorine or anti-coagulants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This pre-treatment can add up to 25% to the final cost of desalted water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Brine Disposal
Both [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | thermal]] and [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | membrane]] processes produce a significant amount of brine, often one cubic meter for every two cubic meters of freshwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. This brine is hotter and 40% to 80% saltier than seawater, and often contains heavy metals, acids, chlorine, and anti-scalant chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Brine disposal is challenging and costly, contributing 5-30% to the freshwater's final cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. Dumping brine underground can foul groundwater, while releasing it into the ocean (even with dilution) harms local ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Extracting and selling salt from brine is not yet economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. These [[Environmental and economic impacts of desalination | environmental issues associated with desalination]] are expected to worsen as water demands increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

### Centralization and National Security
The intense centralization of water systems in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries presents a national security risk. For example, 50% of Saudi Arabia's desalination capacity is concentrated in just five plants, and 60% of the UAE's in four plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. This concentration makes the water supply vulnerable to attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

## Future Directions in Desalination
Despite the challenges, desalination is essential for water-stressed regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Future directions involve technological transitions and systemic changes.

### Transition to Reverse Osmosis
There is a growing global trend away from [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | thermal processes]] and towards [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | Reverse Osmosis (RO)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | RO]] is far less energy-intensive, requiring about 4 to 5 kilowatt-hours per cubic meter of water, roughly a third or quarter of [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | MSF]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This lower [[Trends in desalination and energy consumption | energy consumption]] makes it the dominant technology globally, holding over 60% of the market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | RO]] can also be connected to cheap and [[Energy Sources for Desalination | renewable energy sources like solar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

While [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | MSF methods]] will continue to dominate in the Gulf due to existing investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, GCC countries are exploring more [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | RO-only]] and hybrid [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | RO-thermal systems]] to leverage the benefits of both technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. For example, Saudi Arabia commissioned Shuqaiq 3, one of their first large [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | RO plants]], in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Decentralization
A technology transition away from [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | MSF]] towards [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | SWRO]] can encourage a decentralization trend in water supply systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | RO systems]] have a smaller size threshold for economic viability than [[Desalination technologies MSF and Reverse Osmosis | MSF]], promoting more localized water sources for towns and cities and reducing the need for expensive pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Decentralization would bring water supplies closer to consumers, offering benefits for communities, national security, and the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

### Privatization
Saudi Arabia's recent privatization moves in its freshwater supply industry are expected to continue trends towards more sustainable desalination practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

Australia holds a significant position as a global leader in natural gas exports, but its market development has been shaped by a complex interplay of government policies and international partnerships, alongside its unique geological and geographical challenges. This has led to the country occasionally experiencing [[domestic_natural_gas_shortages_in_australia | natural gas shortages]] despite its abundant reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Early Export Restrictions and Economic Nationalism

For much of its history, Australia prioritized domestic use of natural gas, largely reserving it for internal consumption and exporting coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. By 1970, growing foreign interest in Australia's gas fields sparked feelings of economic nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. In response, Australia's right-leaning federal government imposed a general export embargo on liquefied natural gas (LNG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This policy aimed to ensure that Australia's domestic requirements were met first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## The Northwest Shelf Venture and Policy Shift

The discovery of significant gas reserves in the northwest, notably at Scott Reef in 1971, and later at North Rankin and Goodwin, led to the formation of the Northwest Shelf Venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This project was a joint venture involving Australian players like Woodside Petroleum and Mid-Eastern Oil, alongside foreign multinationals such as Burma Oil, Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, and California Asiatic Oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The venture members planned a massive $12 billion project to develop resources, build an LNG plant, and export LNG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Challenges and Government Intervention
The project faced immediate hurdles due to the nationwide natural gas export ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The left-wing federal government of the time expressed resentment towards the involvement of foreign multinationals and requested at least 50% local ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Despite Woodside being an Australian company and the primary operator, foreign funds and expertise were crucial for exploiting the resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Without export permission, the project could not move forward, as the western Australian market was too small to justify the necessary investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

The Whitlam federal government proposed building a national pipeline grid to address [[challenges_in_transporting_and_distributing_natural_gas_in_australia | Australia's fragmented gas infrastructure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. In 1973, they took over a 1,200-mile pipeline project from Moomba to Sydney as part of this plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Policy Reversal and Export Enablement
Political tides shifted in 1975 with a more right-leaning, business-friendly government coming into power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This new regime was more eager to advance energy projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>:
*   **Ownership Threshold:** The venture naturally reached the 50% local ownership threshold after Burma Oil sold its stake to the Australian mining giant BHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Export Embargo Lifted:** In 1977, the federal government lifted its export embargo, allowing the Northwest Shelf Venture to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This decision was contingent on domestic gas and gas liquid requirements being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Initially, 50% of the gas production was allowed for export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Tax Benefits:** The government provided tax benefits, including extending an existing 20% investment allowance, introducing an income tax rebate, and waiving several other oil and resource taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### International Partnerships and Project Success
In 1978, the venture secured deals with eight major Japanese customers to supply LNG to Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Buoyed by favorable oil market conditions following the Iranian Revolution, construction began in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The Northwest Shelf project, for a time, was the world's single biggest engineering project, involving offshore platforms, undersea pipelines, a massive LNG plant, and LNG tankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

The first LNG exports to Japan commenced in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Japan has remained a regular customer, later joined by the People's Republic of China, with the two countries purchasing 75% of Australia's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. The project also legally reserves a significant portion of production for domestic use in Western Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

## Coal Seam Gas and Eastern Market Development

While Western Australia flourished, the eastern markets, including major cities like Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Hobart, faced supply challenges due to the lack of conventional gas fields and an integrated nationwide pipeline system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. These regions, however, possess large deposits of coal seam gas (methane absorbed within coal seams) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

Throughout the 1970s and 80s, companies like Conoco Australia, Mitsubishi, and Houston Oil and Minerals attempted to harness this methane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. In 1996, BHP's breakthrough in Queensland's Bowen Basin initiated a coal seam gas boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. State governments further incentivized this by promoting a switch from coal to gas, as seen with the Queensland Gas Scheme in 2005, which mandated electricity retailers produce 13-15% of their electricity from gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

The abundance of coal seam reserves in the Bowen Basin attracted export interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. The Queensland state government approved three consortia to build LNG plants and export coal seam gas to Asian markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. The first plant, operated by Santos, came online in December 2014, followed by APLNG in January 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Currently, three LNG plants on Curtis Island collectively produce 26 million tons of LNG annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This new capacity, coupled with existing export infrastructure and proximity to Asia, gave eastern Australian LNG a price advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

## Australia's Current Standing and Future Policy Considerations

In 2020, Australia became the world's leading exporter of LNG, a position it consistently competes for with Qatar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Australia's rise as a natural gas export power, combined with its reputation as a reliably Western-aligned country, has significantly contributed to stabilizing global energy markets, particularly in light of recent international events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

However, despite its export success, Australia's domestic markets continue to face [[domestic_natural_gas_shortages_in_australia | significant energy shortages]] and rising prices, impeding growth and causing political awkwardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Ideas such as a transcontinental pipeline and a nationwide gas reservation policy are being discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Solving Australia's natural gas dilemma will require incorporating these ideas into a coherent nationwide strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

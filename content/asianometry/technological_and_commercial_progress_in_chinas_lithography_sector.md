Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) is China's ambitious project to replace [[development and history of ASML lithography technology | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The company has gained significant attention, particularly due to recent high-profile [[impact_of_export_bans_on_chinese_lithography_industry | export bans to China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Much of the information available relies on China-based sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Historical Development of Lithography in China

China's journey into lithography began in the late 1970s:
*   **1977**: China's first lithography machine, the GK3, was created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **1979**: The GK3 evolved into the JKG3, which was the first domestically created lithography machine for large-scale commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **1978 (Prototype)**: The GK4 prototype, a contact lithography machine, was developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It could print chips on 75-millimeter wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Contact lithography involves the photomask being in direct contact with a photoresist-coated substrate, known for high defect rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The United States invented and commercialized this technology in the 1950s, placing China about two decades behind at this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Early 1980s**: China aimed to simultaneously develop proximity aligners (introducing a gap between mask and substrate) and steppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
    *   **1981**: The Institute of Semiconductors of the Chinese Academy of Sciences successfully developed two proximity aligner prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    *   **1985**: The 45th Institute of the Ministry of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering developed their own stepper, "inspired" by the US-based GCA 4800 DSW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This machine printed designs using the 436 nanometer G-line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **2000**: China began research on machines using argon fluoride (ArF) lasers on the 193 nanometer wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This was a decade after Western companies began shipping such devices in 1990, indicating a continued technology gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Founding and Mission of SMEE

SMEE was founded in March 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **"Zero Two Special Project"**: China's 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015) included 16 major national special projects, with lithography ranked second highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This project focused on developing manufacturing equipment for 22 to 45 nanometer processed chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Other goals included:
    *   Forward research on 14 to 22 nanometer processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
    *   Work on 65 to 90 nanometer special processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    *   Capture at least 10% of the domestic lithography market and attempt to open the international market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   SMEE was designated the country's "national champion" to achieve these goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Early Operations**: SMEE's first office was in the Shanghai Zhangjiang High-Tech Park, near semiconductor companies like SMIC and Spreadtrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The founding general manager and chairman, Ha Rong Ming, was noted for his intense work ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **R&D and Patents**: Over two decades, SMEE has emphasized extensive R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. As of 2019, the company filed over 3,000 patents and received 1,600, with nearly 700 in foreign countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Government Support**: SMEE has received extensive support from both local and central Chinese governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The Shanghai SASAC (the commission overseeing the city's corporate assets) is SMEE's largest owner, holding 32% of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Market Strategy and Products

Given import restrictions, such as high-level optics from Carl Zeiss of Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, SMEE initially targeted less competitive parts of the lithography market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>:
*   **Advanced Packaging**: SMEE started with lithography for advanced packaging processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This strategy aimed for the company to gain experience in "back-end lithography" before moving to "front-end lithography" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   SMEE now holds 80% of the domestic market and 40% of the global market in back-end lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   In 2019, they shipped over 50 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   Major back-end customers include Changjiang Electric Group, Taiwan-based ASE Group, and Tongfu Microelectronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Niche Semiconductor Products**: SMEE expanded into lithography tools for power devices, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and LEDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. LEDs are considered the most promising market among these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Front-End Lithography**: The company is developing products for the front end, intending to sell to companies like Yangtze Memory and SMIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## SMEE's Operational Model and Supply Chain Challenges

SMEE operates on the [[development and history of ASML lithography technology | ASML]] model, aiming to be the final system integrator for lithography tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The core factors for a lithography machine's success are high-precision optics, the light source, high-precision mechanics, and software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

*   **Optics Suppliers**: While [[development and history of ASML lithography technology | ASML]] relies on a joint venture with Carl Zeiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, SMEE's comparable suppliers are identified as Changchun Up Optotech (no longer associated with SMEE) and Beijing Guowang Technology Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Beijing Guowang is building an optics manufacturing factory, but mass supply of immersion-ready optical systems isn't expected until its completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Light Source Suppliers**: SMEE's equivalent to [[development and history of ASML lithography technology | ASML]]'s Cymer is Beijing RS Laser Opto-Electronics Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. However, RS Laser's product is underpowered compared to what [[development and history of ASML lithography technology | ASML]] uses for its immersion systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Foreign Dependency**: A significant challenge for SMEE is the requirement for domestic suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Many core technologies must still be imported or purchased from foreign companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
    *   **Photomasks**: The vast majority are made by [[japans_early_leadership_in_lithography | Japanese companies]] Toppan Printing and Dai Nippon Printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. However, a Chinese company, Jiangsu Nata Opto-Electronic Material Company (Nata), has created a photomask compatible with an [[development and history of ASML lithography technology | ASML]] immersion system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
    *   Other imported components include ball bearings from Sweden, valves from France, and grating alignment systems from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Without these, shipping commercial-grade machines is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Current Technological Capabilities and Gap Analysis

As of August 2021, SMEE's systems support 90 nm, 110 nm, and 280 nm processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. These are specialized systems for back-end lithography, LEDs, MEMS, and power devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Lithography systems are grouped by their laser light source:
*   Eyeline machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
*   Krypton Fluoride (KrF) laser machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>
*   Argon Fluoride (ArF) laser machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
*   Argon Fluoride immersion (ArFi) laser machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
*   EUV machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>

The majority of SMEE's systems use eyeline and KrF lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **SSA 600-20 Scanner**: SMEE's most advanced system for front-end manufacturing at the 90 nanometer node uses an ArF laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
    *   A prototype (the 600-10) was first profiled in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. It had a field size of 22x32 mm and could process about 50 wafers per hour (WPH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
    *   Comparable [[japans_early_leadership_in_lithography | Canon]] and [[japans_early_leadership_in_lithography | Nikon]] machines can process up to five times that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
    *   The 600-20 iteration, as of 2019, was not selling in relevant quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Recent sales are still of outdated eyeline lithography machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **28 nanometer ArFi System**: The most prominent news about SMEE's future pipeline is an ArFi system said to be capable of the 28 nanometer process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This is currently a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, fitting China's pattern of lagging the leading edge by about 10 years (the 28 nm node first shipped around 2011) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
    *   The challenge lies in moving from prototype to high-volume commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. China has historically struggled to turn prototypes into commercially competitive products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
    *   The goal is to deliver commercial-ready 28 nanometer ArFi machines by 2021 or 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, but this deadline is likely to be missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Beijing Guowang's foundry for SMEE's optical systems is not expected to be completed until September 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, making a 2024 ship date ambitious and even then the product is not expected to be commercially competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### Hype vs. Reality

Chinese news sources often exaggerate progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. For example, in November 2018, the Institute of Opto-Electronics Technology announced a 22 nanometer "super-resolution" lithography tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. While CCTV claimed multi-patterning could achieve sub-10 nanometer levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, the tool was not commercially ready, had low accuracy, and a tiny field of view (a few square millimeters), making it extremely slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

In contrast, [[development and history of ASML lithography technology | ASML]]'s Twinscan NXT 1970Ci, a comparable DUV machine capable of the 38 nanometer node and below, offers a field of view of 858 square millimeters (26x33 mm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a> and can process over 250 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## Human Capital Challenges

A significant issue for SMEE is talent acquisition and retention:
*   **Compensation Gap**: SMEE's average PhD salary is comparable to [[development and history of ASML lithography technology | ASML]]'s company-wide average salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. However, [[development and history of ASML lithography technology | ASML]] offers much higher salaries for senior staff (e.g., nearly $200,000 USD for staff software engineers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **Benefits and Work Culture**: [[development and history of ASML lithography technology | ASML]] offers comprehensive benefits like share purchase plans, pension plans, commuting allowances, 40 days of paid leave, and 8% holiday allowance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. SMEE, lacking [[development and history of ASML lithography technology | ASML]]'s capital base (Europe's most valuable tech company at $300 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, cannot be as generous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   **"Huawei Working Practices"**: As a "national champion," SMEE has adopted Huawei's working practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This includes long working hours (e.g., 7 AM to 10 PM, frequent weekend work for Ha Rong Ming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>), political intervention, tough annual assessments for bonuses, and a "Jack Welch-style" bottom 5-10% layoff each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This approach is likely to make it difficult to acquire and retain top talent compared to [[development and history of ASML lithography technology | ASML]]'s focus on people development and turnover reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## Conclusion and Outlook

Chinese media portrays the photolithography effort as the "Mount Everest of the intelligent manufacturing industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, often with strong nationalistic rhetoric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. However, the reality is that SMEE is at least 20 years behind [[development and history of ASML lithography technology | ASML]] in bringing a commercial-ready upper-class lithography device to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Immersion lithography is nascent, and [[development_of_uv_and_euv_lithography_technology | EUV]] is even farther away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. This reality is acknowledged even by Chinese sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

While exaggerated claims can be counterproductive, the progress in back-end lithography and LED lithography is heartening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, especially as China gains market share in the display industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. Some Chinese companies have also built strong track records in other semiconductor equipment areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

SMEE is reportedly considering an IPO in the future, with valuations possibly in the $5-10 billion range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. An IPO would provide more public information on the company's financial and operational status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

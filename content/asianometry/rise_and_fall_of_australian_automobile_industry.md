From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Once employing 100,000 people and producing tens of thousands of vehicles for both domestic consumption and export, the Australian automobile industry has now largely vanished, with the last factory (operated by Toyota) closing in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Other than a few units for national security purposes, the car-making industry has all but disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Rise of the Industry

Following World War II, the [[role_of_australian_government_in_the_automobile_industrys_decline | Australian government]] focused on developing its manufacturing capacity, prioritizing car manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Subsidies and tax concessions were offered to foreign companies to encourage production on Australian soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

Several foreign manufacturers, including Volkswagen, British Motors Leyland, and Ford, entered the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. While most facilities primarily assembled imported parts, some companies engaged in more value-add activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The most notable was GM Holden, an Australian subsidiary of the American automaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. In 1948, GM Holden produced the first "all-Australian car," named the Holden, manufactured in Melbourne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This rugged vehicle was particularly suited for Australia's rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The Holden was immensely popular, with long waiting lists and market dominance throughout the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. By 1951, Holden sold over 25,000 units and was the country's most profitable publicly traded company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Australian cars, especially rugged vehicles like the Holden Ute (pickup trucks), became a fixture of the national culture, embodying a spirit of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This domestic manufacturing industry thrived within a protected market, where high tariffs ensured demand for local employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. These employers could also pass on the costs of paying a "fair and reasonable basic wage," supported by strong trade unions and a unique compulsory arbitration system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Local auto manufacturing also supported a local auto parts ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### The Problem of Foreign Ownership

A key characteristic of the Australian car manufacturing industry was that none of the companies were actually owned by Australians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

#### Upsides
*   Benefited from being part of larger globalized networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   Australian-made auto components could be produced at scale and exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

#### Downsides
*   Companies could not embed deeply within the local industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   Profits flowed to Japanese or American headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   Executives abroad lacked emotional attachment to Australia, making core decisions based solely on the bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   Australia did not own and control its own automaking destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

This "worst of both worlds" situation would eventually become a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## The Decline

By the early 1970s, the domestic automotive manufacturing industry employed over 100,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. However, the 1970s marked a substantial loss of competitiveness for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Loss of Competitiveness
*   **Too many models:** Five companies produced as many as 15 models, with individual production runs as small as 25,000 units, leading to a lack of economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Customer disconnect:** While Australian cars were treasured for their ruggedness, most of the country's population lived in cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This created gaps in the market, especially in the small car segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Japanese imports:** High-quality, low-cost small cars from Japan gained a significant market foothold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Brands like Datsun (Nissan) saw strong sales despite tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Government Reforms and Economic Shocks

The 1972 election of the Whitlam government brought substantial reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This administration, the first Labor government in 32 years, did not look favorably on the [[impact_of_foreign_multinationals_on_australian_car_manufacturing | foreign multinational-owned car makers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

In early 1973, with the Australian economy near full capacity and concerns about rising inflation, the government decided to reduce tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The domestic automotive industry had been slow to reform, and officials believed a more liberal trade policy would provide a competitive jolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. They were confident the economy could survive a rapid drop in trade protections, partly due to expanding trade opportunities with Japan and the increasing export of Australian minerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

The most controversial aspect was an abrupt 25% reduction in all tariffs on imported goods in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This confrontational tactic led GM Holden to fire 5,000 workers, sparking a political crisis and cementing industry opposition to the Labor Party's reforms for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

The year 1973 also saw the OPEC oil embargo and the collapse of the Bretton Woods international monetary regime, ending a long period of post-war prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Oil prices soared, and inflation and unemployment rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This surge in oil prices spurred sales of gas-sipping small and medium four-cylinder cars, a market dominated by the Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. While sales of large six-cylinder cars remained flat, their share of the overall car market collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This illustrated the concept of disruptive innovation, where upstarts take root in a market and relentlessly move up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### Japanese Local Operations and Industry Struggles
Two major Japanese automakers, Toyota and Nissan, set up domestic Australian assembly operations to avoid tariffs, adding to an already bloated market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Nissan Motors, for example, purchased an assembling facility in Clayton, Victoria, and made it a regional headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. These local operations brought Japanese companies into contact with Australia's labor policies, leading to simmering tensions with unions, though they managed to make it work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

As the six-cylinder market declined, local automotive incumbents suffered, with thousands of jobs lost throughout the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. British Motors Leyland closed its Australian operations in 1975, cutting 2,600 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. The worsening economic situation forced the government to reimpose import quotas, which stemmed some bleeding but did not fully resolve the issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

A significant missing ingredient was a coordinating government entity, like Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), to guide the industry's transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Without such guidance, the four remaining domestic OEMs navigated this new world poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. The same macro trends that eroded the domestic market also annihilated the critical export market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Australian automobile exports, which matched domestic consumption at 60,000 units in 1970, dwindled to just a few hundred by 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This collapse signaled to officials that the domestic industry was uncompetitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

### Further Reforms and the Mining Boom

The mid-1980s saw major macroeconomic policy changes under a new government, including banking sector deregulation, financial market liberalization, and floating the Australian dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The intention was to reorient domestic manufacturing industries towards exports, as tariffs were seen as creating inefficient industries unable to compete overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

A new car plan, introduced in late 1983 by Senator John Button, offered car manufacturers credits and subsidies for Australian-made cars, along with temporary government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. However, it also rapidly reduced import tariffs from 57.5% to 45% by 1988, with further reductions until 2000, and removed import quotas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. The aim was to slim the industry into a leaner, more competitive entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

The "shrinking" part of the plan worked: Ford lost $60 million in 1992, and plant closures occurred throughout the 80s and 90s for all domestic automakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Unexpectedly, Australian-made cars became even less competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Domestic car makers responded by cutting costs, reducing investment in R&D and manufacturing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. For decades, foreign companies entered the Australian market primarily to bypass trade protections; when those protections vanished, the multinationals saw little reason to maintain expensive manufacturing operations there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, domestic assembly stabilized at around 350,000 units per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. However, as the country's economy and population grew, the domestic makers' share of the overall market continued to shrink, despite hundreds of millions in annual government support via schemes like the Automotive Competitive and Investment Scheme (ACIS), which cost the government $7 billion AUD from 2001 to 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

The early 2000s also saw the start of a decades-long mining boom, fueled by developing countries like China and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. While this brought prosperity, it also caused a dramatic appreciation in the Australian dollar, which doubled in value against the American dollar between 2001 and 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. This stronger currency dramatically increased the cost of Australian automotive production, leading to chronic losses for the sector and 25,000 job losses from 2003 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

In April 2004, Mitsubishi announced the closure of its engine and assembly plants in southern Adelaide, resulting in 1,167 job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This area heavily depended on manufacturing, which made up 18% of its employment in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. The federal government provided $40 million AUD for the region and $10 million AUD for retrenched Mitsubishi workers, with the state government adding $5 million AUD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. However, these funds were spread thin and likely would not have saved the plant, as each domestically produced Mitsubishi car was already receiving $1,300 AUD in subsidies by 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. The assistance program for retrenched workers also failed to recognize their transferable skills, leading to suboptimal outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. The Mitsubishi plant closed permanently in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

### The Final Years and Collapse

The Mitsubishi closure marked the beginning of the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. The global financial crisis (2008) spurred further government interventions, including the Green Car Innovation Fund and the Automotive Transformation Scheme, which subsidized automotive investment and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. The government also provided a $200 million AUD line of credit to GM Holden after GM filed for bankruptcy in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

In 2013, a new conservative-leaning government led by Prime Minister Tony Abbott came to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. This government philosophically disagreed with the previous administration's interventions, arguing that the government's role was not to prop up private business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. Given that other Australian manufacturing sectors were also struggling, they questioned why cars should receive preferential treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

By this point, the Australian automobile manufacturing industry was a shadow of its former self. Modern car factories typically produce around 250,000 cars per year, but GM Holden (the largest) did 160,000 in the early 2000s, Mitsubishi struggled with 35,000 in 2004, and Ford produced about 70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

Australian labor was expensive, costing multiples more than Thai labor, especially as low-cost manufacturers emerged in China and Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. While unions in other countries like Canada and the United States made concessions on wages and entitlements, Australian labor unions came around too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>.

Ultimately, despite billions in subsidies, the industry showed little return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Government relations with the industry were also strained. Finance Minister Joe Hockey's famous dismissal of GM's approaches – "either you're here or you're not" – combined with constant delays and uncertainty regarding future policy, led Toyota and GM to pull out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

### Consequences of Demise
The loss of Australia's domestic auto industry had wide-ranging consequences:
*   **Domestic Components Industry:** 260 Australian businesses supplied the automotive sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. Without the domestic assembly industry as an anchor, many of these lacked sufficient economies of scale and closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.
*   **R&D Spending:** Automotive R&D by Australian companies vanished. In its final years, companies spent $700 million AUD on R&D, making up 2% of the country's total R&D spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
*   **Laid-off Workers:** Approximately 14,000 people lost their jobs after the Toyota and GM Holden factories closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. Many were older men with immigrant backgrounds; less than half were still working two years later, though government and community support helped cushion the financial blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.
*   **Cultural Impact:** The industry's demise closed a unique chapter in Australian history. Despite foreign ownership, Australian cars like the Holden were culturally significant, embodying the pioneering spirit of a "backyard inventor thriving in the harsh outback" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

### Conclusion: No Heroes or Villains

It is difficult to assign blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. While Canada's auto industry survived with similarly high labor costs and a strong currency, Canada shares a border with the United States, and its factories are far more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. Australia, while blessed with natural resources, must contend with its remote location and higher costs of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

Despite billions poured into the industry, the [[economic_and_policy_factors_affecting_car_production_in_australia | economics and economies of scale]] were simply not there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. However, the [[role_of_australian_government_in_the_automobile_industrys_decline | government could have been more involved]] at critical times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. A comparison is often drawn to Japan's MITI, which in the 1960s, arranged mergers between car makers to create national champions like Toyota and Nissan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. It is pondered whether forceful intervention by the Australian government to merge the five domestic OEMs into one, and holding a controlling share, might have kept the industry alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.

Despite the manufacturing decline, Australia continues to leverage its educated labor pool. The former Toyota Altona factory is now being converted into a transport hub for green hydrogen technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.

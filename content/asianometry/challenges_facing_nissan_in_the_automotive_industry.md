In late December 2024, Nissan announced a plan to merge with Honda, a move described more as a takeover or a "shotgun marriage" hastily arranged by the Japanese government to save a company left behind by the times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Nissan's history has been characterized by significant ups and downs, with this latest downturn potentially marking its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Beginnings: Pre-Ghosn Struggles

Before the intervention of [[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Carlos Ghosn]], Nissan faced severe difficulties. In May 1999, Renault agreed to invest 5 billion euros into the struggling Japanese carmaker for 36.8% of Nissan's shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Years of excessive global expansion, foreign assimilation, and lax management had left Nissan with uneconomical factories, operating at only 53% utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Its product lineup was poor, with only 4 out of over 40 lines being profitable, and its workers were unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The company's dire state led one London analyst to suggest Nissan "probably shouldn't even be in the auto business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## "Le Cost Killer" and Initial Turnaround

[[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Carlos Ghosn]], known as "Le Cost Killer," was brought in as Nissan's COO in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Over the next two years, Ghosn and his team implemented aggressive cost-cutting measures that broke traditional Japanese business norms, justified by the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>:
*   **Portfolio Simplification**: They simplified Nissan's complex portfolio of cross-stock holdings, as Nissan held stocks in 1,300 companies simply due to being part of the "Keiretsu" business family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Supplier Reduction**: The team halved Nissan's vast network of suppliers, many of whom were charging inflated prices due to "family" ties. Relationship managers were assigned to secure the best prices regardless of prior connections, yielding at least $2.25 billion in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Employee Incentive Structure**: Ghosn disrupted norms by promoting younger talent over more senior employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Job Cuts and Factory Closures**: In a culturally vexing move for Japan, Ghosn's revival plan cut 21,000 jobs through attrition and shut down five factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This eliminated "ghost jobs" held by former senior managers acting as non-operational "advisors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

These drastic measures led to Nissan's return to profitability in 2002, ahead of schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Looming Clouds and Industry-Wide Challenges

Despite initial success, Nissan faced significant challenges throughout the 2000s:
*   **Economic Crises**: The Global Financial Crisis caused Nissan's sales to fall 22%, resulting in a $2.9 billion net loss in 2009 and forcing thousands of job cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The devastating March 2011 earthquake further disrupted factories and global supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Rising R&D Costs**: [[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Ghosn]] correctly identified major long-term industry developments, such as the need for ever-tightening safety and environmental regulations, leading to rising R&D costs. These higher fixed costs ($132 billion in 2014) necessitated selling many more cars for a good return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Need for Consolidation**: Carmaker consolidation was seen as a way to share these costs, making it crucial for companies to achieve large enough scale to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. [[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Ghosn]] believed the Renault-Nissan alliance, with six million annual units sold, had the potential to compete with giants like VW, Toyota, or GM, aiming for 10 million cars a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

## Unhealthy Growth Strategies

To meet ambitious targets of raising global market share and operating margins, Nissan adopted several unsustainable growth strategies:
*   **Deep Discounts**: Nissan offered persistent deep discounts on its cars. By 2018, incentives averaged 16.7%, significantly higher than the industry's 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Dealer Incentives**: The company used "stair step" incentives, offering large cash bonuses to dealers who met ambitious sales quotas but nothing if they fell short. This "grow or go" approach initially worked but led to desperate or disgruntled dealers as quotas ratcheted up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Fleet Sales**: Nissan increased sales to rental fleets, which negatively impacted the resale value of its car models in the used car market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
These strategies prioritized "growth at all costs," damaging brand value, annoying dealers, and worrying consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

## Missed Opportunities in Product Lineup

Nissan's product lineup also stagnated, missing key market shifts:
*   **Shift to SUVs and Trucks**: As American tastes shifted towards SUVs and trucks in the late 2000s and early 2010s due to cheaper gas, Nissan's core sedan lines fell out of favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Nissan Titan**: The Nissan Titan pickup truck, introduced in 2003 to challenge Ford and GM, faced manufacturing difficulties, its look became stale, and sales fell short of Ghosn's target of 100,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **EV and Self-Driving Execution**: Despite being an EV pioneer with the Nissan Leaf and an early proponent of self-driving technology (predicting self-driving cars by 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, Nissan's execution was lacking. The Nissan Leaf and Renault's ZOE EV had almost no commonality, even on batteries, leading to expensive products and lost momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

## Simmering Internal Tensions within the Alliance

Attempts to deepen integration within the Renault-Nissan Alliance faced significant resistance, touching upon [[cultural_and_geopolitical_tensions_within_the_renaultnissan_alliance | cultural and geopolitical tensions]]:
*   **Engineer Resistance**: Engineers bristled at shared platforms and cost-cutting measures that they felt compromised car identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Uneven Shareholding**: Nissan perceived its arrangement as uneven, with the smaller Renault holding voting power over Nissan but not vice versa, and Nissan increasingly propping up Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Renault, however, viewed this as a matter of contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Government Interference**: Both companies' close ties to their governments led to geopolitical concerns. In 2015, the French government raised its stake in Renault, threatening Nissan and leading to a dispute that required a face-saving agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

## [[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Carlos Ghosn]]'s Downfall

Ghosn's long tenure, his lifestyle, high pay, and the tensions over a potential forced merger contributed to his downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
*   **High Compensation**: In 2010, Ghosn's reported earnings of $9.6 million in cash and stock were significantly higher than other Nissan executives ($2.2 million) and even Toyota's chairman, Akio Toyoda ($1.4 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, sparking controversy within the Japanese context.
*   **Arrest and Escape**: In November 2018, internal auditors discovered Nissan-purchased residences used by Ghosn personally, which led to his arrest in Japan on charges of underreporting income and other allegations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. He later dramatically escaped to Lebanon, claiming to flee a rigged justice system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

## Post-Ghosn Struggles

[[role_of_carlos_ghosn_in_nissans_history | Ghosn]]'s abrupt departure created chaos, especially when his successor, Hiroto Saikawa, also resigned due to stock pay violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. From 2019 to 2021, Nissan struggled amidst a pandemic, cutting more jobs, closing factories, reducing incentives, and resetting dealer relations, leading to a significant loss of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

A major challenge was resetting its unequal shareholding relationship with Renault, a complex process fraught with "toxicity, leaks to the press, massive internal infighting, and tangled ties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. A deal was finally sealed in 2023, reducing Renault's stake to 15% and granting Nissan voting rights for its 15% stake in Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. Nissan also bought into Renault's new EV division, Ampere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. The alliance also awkwardly includes Mitsubishi Motors, added in 2016 after an emissions scandal, with its future remaining cloudy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

## Rise of the EVs and Chinese Market Decline

Nissan faces a "massive challenge" in rolling out electric vehicles in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, exacerbated by the rapid and aggressive rise of Chinese EV companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. These companies, fueled by a powerful EV ecosystem and a titanic domestic market, produce advanced products at hyper speed, treating cars like consumer electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

The traditional internal combustion engine joint ventures, like Dongfeng Nissan, have struggled to keep up. In 2023, [[impact_of_the_chinese_ev_market_on_nissan | Nissan's Chinese sales fell some 30%]], with similar declines projected for 2024. Utilization at their seven factories in China is reportedly at 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. China accounts for a third of Nissan's sales, making it their top market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. The ongoing internal management chaos and focus on the Renault share deal distracted senior management while this market burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

## Current [[nissan_and_honda_merger | Nissan and Honda Merger]] Talks

The recent [[nissan_and_honda_merger | Honda-Nissan merger]] talks were reportedly initiated due to Taiwanese giant Foxconn's interest in acquiring a stake in Nissan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Foxconn, seeking to enter the EV industry and enable a client to break into the US market, viewed Nissan as the "ultimate play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

However, Honda is reportedly not enthusiastic about dealing with Nissan's problems, which include an aging lineup and a lopsided cost situation where Japan accounts for less than 20% of car production but almost half of the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. Honda's CEO famously stated, when asked why Nissan would be a good partner, "That's a difficult one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. Honda has also demanded that Nissan triple its profit by 2026 as a condition for the merger to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. This condition raises the question of why Nissan would need to merge if it could achieve such a feat independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. The entire situation is described as a "raging dumpster fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>, with the end of Nissan as an independent entity seemingly approaching, regardless of whether the merger occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

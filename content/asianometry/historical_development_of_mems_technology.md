[[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS)]] are microsystems that combine both electric and mechanical functions, built using advanced techniques similar to those used for integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Despite being a "miraculous" technology found ubiquitously today, the MEMS industry has historically faced significant [[challenges_in_mems_production_and_economic_issues | economic issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Early Vision and Pioneers

The dream of creating extremely small devices has existed for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. In 1959, Richard Feynman's Caltech lecture, "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom," proposed the idea of manipulating atoms individually to create useful tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Feynman even offered a $1,000 prize for a tiny motor (fitting in a 0.4 mm cube), which was claimed less than a year later by a Caltech engineer using conventional tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

The first true MEMS product emerged in 1967 when Harvey Nathanson at Westinghouse developed the resonant gate transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This pre-modern micro-machined transistor, about one millimeter long and made of gold, was unique because it could move; electricity could control the distance between its gate and electrode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Its ability to respond only to a narrow range of input signals made it useful as a frequency filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Major Commercial Applications

It wasn't until 1979 that MEMS achieved significant commercial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>:

*   **Printer Inkjet Nozzles (1979)**: Hewlett-Packard utilized silicon micro-machining to develop inkjet nozzles for thermal inkjet technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This technology heats ink to about 100 degrees Celsius, creating bubbles that push ink through the micro-machined nozzle onto paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. While the nozzles themselves don't move, MEMS technology enabled their creation and tiny size, allowing HP to combine many for increased printer resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. These nozzles were the technology's most successful application at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Sensors (1990s)**: The 1990s saw the MEMS industry discover major [[commercial_applications_of_mems_in_industry_sectors | commercial applications]] in sensors for acceleration, pressure, and direction, serving industrial, medical, and electronics sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
    *   **Automotive Airbag Sensors**: Early airbag sensors were large, heavy, complex, and expensive mechanical devices, costing hundreds of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. In 1991, Analog Devices introduced the first commercial MEMS acceleration sensor, less than one square centimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This sensor, the ADXL50, used capacitive sense fingers attached to a mass that moved upon acceleration, changing capacitive values sensed by the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This monolithic system was smaller, more reliable, and cost significantly less ($5 vs. $20-$100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. These sensors greatly contributed to the widespread adoption of airbags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Modern cars incorporate dozens of MEMS-based sensors for anti-lock brakes, active suspension, navigation, and rollover detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, with over 60 million airbag sensors alone sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
    *   **Medical Blood Pressure Sensors**: These became the next significant application, used in hospitals to monitor blood pressure via intravenous lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Early external sensors cost over $600 and required sterilization and recalibration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The MEMS version cost only ten dollars, with packaging making it disposable and easier for medical use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. These sensors are crafted from silicon into a thin membrane (diaphragm), with stress-sensitive polysilicon resistors placed along its edges, suspended over a vacuum cavity to form an absolute pressure sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The medical MEMS-based sensor industry is now valued at over $6 billion, with blood pressure sensors being the largest segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
    *   **Inertial Sensors in Consumer Electronics**: Building on early pressure and accelerometer designs, manufacturers developed versatile, low-power inertial MEMS-based sensors now found in popular consumer electronics like the Nintendo Switch, which contains ultra-low-power inertial sensors with gyroscope and accelerometer capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   **Other Consumer Applications**: MEMS micro-machining technologies are also utilized in visual displays, optical switches (using micro-mirrors to redirect light), and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## [[design_and_manufacturing_processes_of_mems | MEMS Manufacturing and Design Considerations]]

The primary approach for [[design_and_manufacturing_processes_of_mems | commercial MEMS production]] uses high-volume IC techniques like photolithography and etching to add or remove layers on a 2D substrate, creating a 3D shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. However, there isn't a single, universal methodology, leading companies to explore other economical machining approaches:

*   **Electrochemical Micro Machining (ECM)**: Originally for low-end PC boards, ECM creates MEMS by locally and selectively etching metals with an electrode tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Other Methods**: Laser beam machining, electrode discharge machining, and LIGA are also used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

While better machining costs are crucial, significant production and cost issues also stem from design and back-end steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Design Differences from Integrated Circuits

Despite similarities, MEMS and integrated circuits (ICs) have fundamental differences in [[history_of_chip_design_and_evolution_of_electronic_design_automation | design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>:

*   **Scaling Effects**: Miniaturizing mechanical systems does not mean they behave identically. For instance, at the micro-scale, friction forces are much stronger than inertia, and tiny flow spaces are prone to blockages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Conversely, electro-osmotic effects at the micrometer scale can be utilized, such as electric fields to pump reactants in biochips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Philosophical Design Differences**:
    *   **VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration)**: Revolutionized [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | semiconductor design]] with a modular approach, allowing systems and chips to be built from generic modules and standardized cell libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Libraries are designed independently, often with the production process, ensuring product yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. VLSI objects primarily process signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
    *   **Mechanical Design**: Lacks a similar standardized library approach (except for basic components like bolts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Mechanical components must be custom-tailored to specific products, accommodating weight, space, and energy restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. They often need to perform multiple functions like containing liquids, rotating, sliding, or supporting loads simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **CAD Software**: Companies like CoventorWare and IntelliCAD are developing CAD and design automation software suites to help MEMS designers understand microstructure design and electromechanical behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Packaging and Economic Challenges

Testing and packaging, the "back end" of the [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | semiconductor production process]], are vital for MEMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. For MEMS-based sensors, packaging accounts for 75-80% of the final cost, a significant reversal from ICs where packaging is a secondary support role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. For example, an HVAC pressure sensor priced at $20-$30 has packaging as its majority cost, while the raw die costs less than 50 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

This cost disparity arises because ICs are self-contained systems, but MEMS must intimately interact with the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. A pressure sensor needs different packaging than a micro-mirror array or a microfluidic MEMS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, adding substantial engineering and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

Analog Devices, an early investor in MEMS for airbag sensors, faced pricing challenges from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Despite building an in-house manufacturing facility, it took nine years to become profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Early deals included automatic price declines, reflecting an optimistic view of efficiency gains akin to the IC industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Yield is a critical factor for product cost, with doubling yield halving the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. However, achieving this is difficult, leading to optimistic projections and market prices that don't reflect the full investment in development, production, packaging, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Relentless price erosion (3-5% quarterly) erodes margins, discouraging investment in promising MEMS applications like micropropulsion for cube satellites or lidar mirrors for autonomous cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## The Future of MEMS

Often called the "second silicon revolution," MEMS technology involves microscopic moving parts that can replicate the functions of much larger objects, offering smaller, cheaper, and better solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. However, its own creativity and diversity have hindered the adoption of widespread standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Unlike the [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | semiconductor industry]] with entities like Sematech or DARPA, the MEMS industry lacks a unifying force to map a way forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. To fully realize its technical and commercial potential, the various players—designers, foundries, vendors, and end-users—need to collaborate more closely to establish standards and address its persistent issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

In 2019, ASML shipped its first high-volume [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] system, marking the culmination of a decades-long journey and shifting the semiconductor [[EUV and DUV technologies in semiconductor manufacturing | lithography]] industry's focus from Asia to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This was a significant loss for Japan, which had invented [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] and whose companies had led the [[EUV and DUV technologies in semiconductor manufacturing | lithography]] industry before ASML's rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Japan's journey in [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] development highlights the immense [[challenges_in_developing_euv_systems | challenges in developing EUV systems]] for commercial readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Early Discoveries and Initial Approaches

[[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] was invented in Japan in 1986 by Dr. Hiro Kinoshita, then at NTT, who successfully printed a circuit pattern using [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] light and a reflective optic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. At the time, [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] was just one of several potential "Next Generation" [[EUV and DUV technologies in semiconductor manufacturing | lithography]] candidates, alongside Electron Beam direct write, proximity X-ray, ion beam projection, Electron Beam projection, and 157 nanometer fluorine [[EUV and DUV technologies in semiconductor manufacturing | lithography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Japanese companies initially favored proximity X-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The US Department of Energy's early [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] project was concluding without significant industry follow-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, and as late as 1997, Sematech ranked [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] fourth, with X-ray still in first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. However, Intel, after observing demonstrations in Japan and at Department of Energy labs, saw the potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Intel provided bridge funding to keep the DOE's [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] R&D team together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, leading to the founding of EUV LLC in 1998, an industry consortium aimed at raising an estimated $60 million per year for [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV lithography]] commercialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Due to American restrictions on foreign participation, Japanese [[EUV and DUV technologies in semiconductor manufacturing | lithography]] makers Nikon and Canon could not directly join EUV LLC, though they were allowed to participate in design reviews and working groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Japan's Independent EUV Development Program

Faced with this exclusion, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched its own [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV lithography]] program in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The plan had three phases:
*   **Phase 1 (1998-2001)**: Focused on developing basic technologies for the exposure tool, mask, and resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This was managed by ASET (Association of Super Advanced Electronic Technologies), a multi-year research consortium fully funded by MITI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Phase 2 (2001-2003)**: Aimed to turn ASET's raw technology into a working prototype, with partial financial support from the Japanese semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Phase 3 (2006 onwards)**: Intended for the Japanese semiconductor industry, including Selete (Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies) and [[EUV and DUV technologies in semiconductor manufacturing | lithography]] makers Nikon and Canon, to commercialize the prototype into a product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Key Subsystems and Their Challenges

Developing an [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] machine involved complex engineering for three core systems: the exposure tool, the mask, and the resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

#### Exposure Tool
The exposure tool includes an [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] light source and an optic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. ASET focused its limited resources on optics manufacturing, including adding reflective multi-layers to mirrors and cleaning them, and metrology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This meant the critical light source development was reassigned to a new industry organization, the Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography System Development Association (EUVA), founded in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

EUVA, comprising academia and industry players like Ushio, Canon, Nikon, Komatsu, Gigaphoton, Toshiba, NEC, Fujitsu, Renesas, and several universities, researched two approaches for producing [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] light:
*   **Laser-produced plasma (LPP)**: Firing a laser at a material to create plasma that emits [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This was the approach ASML eventually adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Discharge-produced plasma (DPP)**: Creating a material cloud and firing high-powered sparks between electrodes within it to generate light-emitting plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. EUVA researched both, with LPP at the Hiro Scott Research Center and DPP at the Gotemba Research Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

#### Photoresist
ASET also handled the [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] photoresist. The main [[challenges_in_developing_euv_systems | challenge]] was [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] light's high absorbability by traditional resist materials; it could only penetrate about 700 angstroms, far short of the traditional 4,000 angstrom depth needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This necessitated the development of new thin layer imaging (TLI) technologies, a collaboration between ASET and Himeji Institute of Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

#### Mask
The mask contains the chip design. ASET needed new subsystems for producing defect-free mirror mask blanks, adding patterns, and cleaning surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The goal was to achieve extremely low defect rates (0.003 defects per square centimeter), with a defect threshold of just a few nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Existing DUV light could not penetrate deep enough to inspect defects, requiring [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] light itself for inspection, known as actinic light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This part of the process was handled by a separate organization within the Mirai research consortium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

By 2005, the Japanese [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] effort had expanded significantly, with four research consortia: ASET (resist contamination, multi-layer mirror masks), EUVA ([[Evolution of lithography and optics systems | exposure tool]] light source, optics), Leading Project (inter-university light source collaboration), and Mirai (mask defect control and detection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This contrasted with the American project, which had a single entity, EUV LLC, overseeing early commercialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## Race Against ASML

The American and Japanese programs shared information, allowing Japan to benefit from US progress, though the US was clearly in the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Japan's 2005 plan targeted high-volume [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV lithography]] for the 45 nanometer process node by 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Mirai successfully produced an actinic blank inspection tool by 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

For actual [[Evolution of lithography and optics systems | EUV exposure tools]], Canon and Nikon aimed to first produce a small field prototype (pre-alpha machine) for testing components like the resist and mask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The American Micro Exposure Tool (MET), a small field device, was delivered in mid-2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Japan's ambitious schedule required a working pre-alpha machine by end of 2005, an alpha tool by 2006, and a beta tool by 2007 to catch up to ASML, which was putting finishing touches on its Alpha demo tool for delivery in August 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

### Canon's Setbacks

Canon, the junior partner in [[EUV and DUV technologies in semiconductor manufacturing | EUV]] efforts, had not yet mastered 193 nanometer immersion [[EUV and DUV technologies in semiconductor manufacturing | lithography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. In 2006, Canon and EUVA completed their small field prototype, the SFET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. They planned to start producing their full field 6-mirror prototype, the VS2, in 2009 for completion in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. However, Canon struggled with core [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV problems]] such as raising the [[advancements_in_euv_power_efficiency | EUV power level]], producing defect-free masks, and extending optic lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. The global financial crisis further impacted Canon, leading to cuts in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Canon never built the VS2 and currently only sells KrF non-immersion or dry [[EUV and DUV technologies in semiconductor manufacturing | lithography]] systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

### Nikon's Struggles and Withdrawal

Nikon was Japan's [[EUV and DUV technologies in semiconductor manufacturing | lithography]] leader, being the only other producer of immersion [[EUV and DUV technologies in semiconductor manufacturing | lithography]] alongside ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. From 2001 to 2004, Nikon worked with ASET on three iterations of their small field prototype [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] tool, nicknamed Hina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. In April 2006, Nikon began producing its first full field [[Evolution of lithography and optics systems | exposure tool]], a 6-mirror system called the EUV-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This Alpha device was completed and installed at the Selete R&D Center in January 2008, about 1.5 years behind ASML's 2006 Alpha demo tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

Despite being a substantial achievement, the EUV-1 was not commercially competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Its late installation pushed the high-volume [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] ship schedule from the 45 nanometer node to the 32 nanometer node, potentially even further to 28 or 22 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This required higher [[advancements_in_euv_power_efficiency | EUV machine power]], but the EUV-1's light source power output was a major drawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

The EUV-1 used a discharge-produced plasma (DPP) contraption by Ushio and its subsidiary Extreme Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. While DPP was considered more power-efficient, physically smaller, and cleaner than LPP, it struggled to output sufficient power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. The EUV-1's light source peaked at 100 Watts, far below the high-volume production goal of 250 Watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Achieving this would require a major system change, swapping xenon for tin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Though the tin-based DPP concept was "nifty," it faced contamination issues and failed to produce enough power to be economically viable before the project ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. ASML also tried DPP but halted work on it in 2013, achieving sufficient power levels only after pioneering its laser double-shot method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. It's likely Nikon would have eventually swapped to the LPP approach, with Gigaphoton as a potential supplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

The EUV-1, while capable of producing fine patterns (26-33 nanometers wide), struggled with contamination control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] light continuously hitting the mirror's surface created carbon contamination, deteriorating reflectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. Introducing pure oxygen and using [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] dry cleaning helped with carbon contamination, but researchers then faced a mysterious contamination from a silicon carbon compound called siloxane, which persisted into 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

Nikon planned to follow the EUV-1 with the EUV-2, scheduled for 2011-2012, targeting the 32 nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. However, ASML's lead grew to 18 months to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. The global financial crisis in 2009 led Nikon to cut R&D budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. While Nikon denied putting [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] development on hold, the EUV-2 remained an in-house unit, with the EUV-3 planned for 2012 instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

In July 2012, Intel announced a $4 billion investment in ASML for up to a 15% stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. This caused Nikon's shares to fall, as Intel was its second-biggest customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. The market realized Intel was committing to ASML alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. Without Intel as a cornerstone customer, Nikon likely decided that spending hundreds of millions annually on [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] R&D and capital expenditures was no longer viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. Nikon's [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] efforts quietly tailed off, and the EUV-3 never shipped in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. ASML became the last company standing in the [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV lithography]] industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

## Legacy and Cost

Japan's [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] efforts were not entirely in vain. Many component developments led to viable, technologically advanced businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. For example, the actinic blank inspection tool from Mirai and its collaboration with Lasertec are notable successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Japanese companies also hold dominant positions in the [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] photoresist space (JSR, Shin-Etsu, Tokyo Ohka Kogyo) and related equipment (Tokyo Electron) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

The total cost of Japan's [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] effort from 1999 to 2012 is estimated to be between $5 billion to $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. This includes Nikon and Canon's R&D expenses, the $90 million annual budgets of ASET and the four consortia, and investments from other semiconductor makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. For comparison, the original VLSI project that reshaped Japan's semiconductor industry in the late 1970s cost about $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. Developing an independent [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] machine from scratch today would likely require at least $5 billion to $10 billion, direct guidance and information sharing from European and American makers, and about 10 to 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

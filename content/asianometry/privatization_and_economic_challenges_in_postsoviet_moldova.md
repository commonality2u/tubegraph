Moldova, a small country in Eastern Europe, was one of its poorest and most corrupt nations after the collapse of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Over two decades, politicians enriched businessmen, who then became politicians themselves, effectively taking control of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This process led to the accumulation of immense [[oligarchs_and_political_power_in_moldova | oligarchic wealth]] by individuals who controlled the country behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Post-Soviet Economic Crisis
The Republic of Moldova, a landlocked country between Romania and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, declared its independence from the collapsing Soviet Union in August 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Facing immense [[challenges_faced_by_the_soviet_economy_in_its_later_years | challenges]] as a post-Soviet state, Moldova embarked on a wholesale remaking of its identity, economy, and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

The immediate concern was addressing the ailing economy, which was collapsing rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The new Moldovan economy shrank by an average of seven percent per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The country experienced [[hyperinflation_and_economic_challenges_during_the_soviet_war_communism | hyperinflation]], with a monthly inflation rate of 75 percent in the first six months of 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Without a mechanism to adjust salaries and pensions to these new prices, 79 percent of the Moldovan population fell into poverty by the end of 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Adding to these problems, Transnistria, Moldova's most industrialized area, became de facto independent and out of Moldova's reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

## Economic Reforms and Privatization
To stabilize the economy, the new government announced a transition to a functional market economy by 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This system aimed for two key changes:
1.  **Liberalized Trade**: Prices of essential goods like milk, eggs, and bread were to be set by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
2.  **[[privatization_of_stateowned_enterprises_in_japan | Privatization]] of State Property**: Shares in state-owned firms and land from collectively owned and state-owned farms were to be distributed to the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The government implemented these reforms quickly, hoping for a swift "shock therapy" recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. However, many economic relief efforts came years too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Inflation did not abate until 1994 with the introduction of a new currency, the Moldovan Leu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, and salary and pension indexing did not begin until 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Botched Privatization
While legislation for [[privatization_and_mismanagement_of_national_steel_corporation | privatization]] passed in 1991, it did not start until 1993 due to political squabbling and a lack of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Much of the execution was "bobbled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>:
*   **Corporate Shares**: Shares of state-owned companies were distributed to workers and the public, but company managers, with insider knowledge, either bought shares at obscenely low prices or simply pilfered the best assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Agricultural Land**: Land distribution, mostly occurring between 1998 and 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, was also botched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Workers received plots without considering land quality, sometimes getting barren land while others received fertile vineyards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Plots were often not connected, and in some cases, multiple people received the same cow or tractor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Smart individuals with insider information exploited their positions to assemble massive parcels of fertile land, creating private, oligarch-owned versions of the old Soviet collective farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

These state [[privatization_and_mismanagement_of_national_steel_corporation | schemes]] ultimately failed to achieve their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Instead, they enriched a select group of connected individuals, creating a class of [[oligarchs_and_political_power_in_moldova | oligarchs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## Consequences and Continued Challenges
By 1997, Moldova's GDP had fallen to just 35 percent of what it was a decade earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Over 50 percent of the population still lived in poverty, on less than $2.15 a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Many turned to the black market, which contributed 70 percent of the country's livelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. A 2000 poll found that 91 percent of the people were dissatisfied with their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. By 2005, 20 percent of the population had emigrated, making personal remittances one of Moldova's biggest sources of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. The country also continues to deal with a severe organ trafficking issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Rise of Corruption and Oligarchs
The 2000s were marked by theft and [[moldovas_political_and_economic_corruption | corruption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. Politicians infiltrated the Moldovan economy, enriching themselves and their families by transferring public assets to private hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Oleg, son of former Communist Party leader Vladimir Voronin, headed a business empire receiving over 2,000 rich government contracts during Voronin's eight years in power, becoming Moldova's first billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

A prominent figure in this era was Vladimir Plahotniuc, who became one of the country's wealthiest and most powerful [[oligarchs_and_political_power_in_moldova | oligarchs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. By the end of the 2000s, Moldova had 70 billionaires, whose total wealth accounted for 138 percent of reported GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Plahotniuc alone was worth two billion dollars, making him the richest man in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. After defecting to the Democratic Party, he used his wealth and media ownership to become one of Moldova's most powerful leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

### The "Robbery of the Century"
In November 2014, a massive scandal erupted, dubbed the "robbery of the century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Three Moldovan banks were taken over and forced to issue nearly three billion dollars of bad loans, approximately 15 percent of the country's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. This money was laundered through shell companies to Latvian banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. When the loans were not repaid, the banks collapsed, and the Moldovan National Central Bank secretly bailed them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. To cover this, the Ministry of Finance issued a billion dollars in 25-year bonds, burdening the Moldovan people for over a quarter-century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. The Moldovan currency devalued by over 40 percent, causing inflation to explode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. This scheme was masterminded by Ilan Shore, an Israel-born Moldovan oligarch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

By the mid-to-late 2010s, the Moldovan people had lost trust in their government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>, with a September 2016 poll finding that 80 percent felt the country was going in the wrong direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Despite the fall of Plahotniuc in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>, Moldova remains a profoundly poor and [[moldovas_political_and_economic_corruption | corrupt]] society, requiring significant time and effort to reverse decades of poorly executed policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

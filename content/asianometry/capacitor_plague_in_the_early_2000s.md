The [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | Capacitor Plague]] was a widespread issue in the early 2000s, characterized by the abnormal failure of [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | capacitors]], particularly electrolytic capacitors, in various electronic devices.

Starting in the early 2000s, reports emerged of numerous PC motherboards exhibiting leaking or even popping [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | capacitors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Victims described hearing a loud "POP," like a distant firework, accompanied by a weird, fishy smell, followed by the computer failing to reboot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Upon inspection, small cylindrical [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | capacitors]] on the board would be found swollen or burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This phenomenon became widely known as the Capacitor Plague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Basics of Capacitors
A capacitor is an electronic component that stores electricity, similar to a battery, but it discharges its electrical energy very rapidly, sometimes in mere microseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The fundamental [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | structure of a capacitor]] consists of two electrically conductive plates, known as electrodes (anode and cathode), separated by a material called the dielectric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The concept is similar to how capacitors are used in DRAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Electrolytic Capacitors (E-caps)
[[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | Electrolytic capacitors]], often abbreviated as E-caps, are named for their electrolyte, which functions as the capacitor's cathode or negative electrode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This electrolyte can be solid, gel, or liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

An E-cap typically comprises two strips of aluminum foil, separated by a thin layer of porous paper or tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This paper and the gap between the foil strips are saturated with the electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The positive electrode (anode foil) is coated with aluminum oxide, which serves as the dielectric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The entire assembly is rolled into a sealed protective housing, usually aluminum, to prevent the electrolyte from drying out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Some E-caps include a vent to release built-up gas and prevent explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Aluminum E-caps are widely used due to their good capacitance-to-size and cost ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. A capacitor's charge-holding ability correlates with the surface area of its electrodes and is inversely correlated with the distance between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Aluminum E-caps achieve high performance by using very thin separator paper, allowing the dielectric to be extremely thin, and by etching the aluminum foil to increase electrode surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Uses in Electronics
A typical PC motherboard might contain around 60 E-caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Their primary uses include:
*   **Filtering**: E-caps smooth out fluctuating DC power converted from AC by a rectifier in power supply modules. They charge when voltage peaks and discharge when it dips, ensuring steady power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Decoupling**: [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | Capacitors]] are used to smooth power supply fluctuations to chips like microprocessors, absorbing voltage spikes and boosting dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

E-caps are not limited to PC motherboards; they are also found in camcorders, VCRs, televisions, stereos, and LCD screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The aluminum E-cap industry is a multi-billion dollar market, valued at approximately $3-3.5 billion in 2002 and $5-6 billion today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Major E-cap suppliers are Japanese, Taiwanese, or Chinese, producing billions of units annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. In 2002, Taiwan alone produced 22.5 billion E-caps, accounting for 30% of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## [[failure_causes_of_capacitors_and_the_factors_contributing_to_their_aging | Failure Causes of Capacitors]]
[[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | Electrolytic capacitors]] are electrochemical components that naturally age and corrode, generally having shorter lifespans (about 10-20 years) than other capacitor types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. As a capacitor ages, its Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) rises, and its capacitance slowly declines, leading to a parametric failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

**Factors accelerating aging**: The most significant factors are humidity and heat. Heat can cause the electrolyte to dry out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
**Catastrophic Failure**: Beyond aging, [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | capacitors]] can fail catastrophically. A bulged capacitor loses capacitance and can cause a short circuit, while an exploded one might even cause a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This catastrophic failure is what became prevalent in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## Hints of Defects
Reports of bulged or exploded [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | capacitors]] largely began in late 2002, though some accounts place the start earlier in mid-2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Gary Headlee, an electronics repairman in Utah, claimed to have replaced approximately 40,000 leaky capacitors on nearly 1,500 motherboards in a year starting summer 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. He also observed an increase in faulty E-caps in Mitsubishi televisions, JVC VCRs, and Sony camcorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Journalist Carey Holzman also reported on leaking [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | capacitors]] in Taiwan-made motherboards like ABIT and Asus in October 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## The Rubycon Story: A Narrative of [[industrial_espionage_and_its_impact_on_the_capacitor_industry | Industrial Espionage]]
The story behind these failures was first reported by Dennis Zogbi in the September/October 2002 issue of "Passive Component Industry" magazine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
According to Zogbi's report, a materials scientist from Japanese electronics company Rubycon Corporation left to work for Taiwan's Luminous Town Electric's factory in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This scientist allegedly replicated Rubycon's P-50 water-based electrolyte formula for Luminous Town's aluminum E-caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Subsequently, some of the scientist's staff defected from Luminous Town, taking a partial electrolyte formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This incomplete formula, missing critical additives, was then sold to other Taiwanese E-cap companies or resellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The missing additives caused E-caps to suffer hydrogen gas build-up, leading to rupture or explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Luminous Town did not deny stealing the electrolyte formulation from Rubycon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Zogbi's story implicated 5 to 11 Taiwanese producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, suggesting that "anybody who uses contract manufacturers that outsource to Taiwan was affected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. While the exact timing is debated, Zogbi indicated the event happened around mid-2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Broken E-caps typically bore lesser-known brands like "Tayeh," "Choyo," "Chhsi," or were unmarked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Fallout and Denials
Several computer manufacturers acknowledged issues. IBM, then still making PCs, confirmed a small number of desktop PCs were returned due to capacitor-induced short-circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. IBM spokesperson Ray Gorman described the problem as "minuscule," affecting less than 1% of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. However, with 148.1 million PCs shipped globally in 2002, even less than 1% could mean significant disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Taiwanese motherboard maker ABIT admitted to an E-cap problem and responded by switching from Taiwanese to Japanese suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. ABIT was later sued for selling defective [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | capacitors]] as early as 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The cost of settling and repairing bad boards may have contributed to ABIT's exit from the motherboard business in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

The electrolyte company accused of buying the flawed formula was Lien Yan in Taichung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Lien Yan denied the accusations, claiming they damaged their business and called the Rubycon story "FUD" (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) spread by the Japanese to regain market share from Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Luxon, a major Taiwanese capacitor supplier, also issued a statement blaming Lien Yan but emphasized they never purchased electrolyte from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## The Electrolyte's Critical Role
The electrolyte is a critical trade secret in capacitor manufacturing, determining its operating conditions, voltage, and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. These are complex formulations with many chemical components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

A 2004 report by the Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering at the University of Maryland, commissioned by a capacitor maker, indicated that the electrolytes in bulging [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | capacitors]] lacked a critical additive called a "depolarizer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Depolarizers reduce gas generation within the E-cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Their absence caused the electrolyte to become more alkaline than intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This alkalinity, combined with a lack of protective phosphate ions on the aluminum oxide dielectric, caused the dielectric to dissolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. As the dielectric thinned, capacitance unnaturally increased, a key indicator of bulging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This exposed the underlying aluminum foil, allowing impurities to react and create electrons, which then reacted with hydrogen ions in the water-based electrolyte to produce hydrogen gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

## Broader Industry Challenges
While the Rubycon [[industrial_espionage_and_its_impact_on_the_capacitor_industry | industrial espionage]] story is often associated with the Capacitor Plague, skepticism exists about it being the sole cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

### Too Widespread and Unrelated Failures
The widespread nature of capacitor failures made people attribute every failure to the "Plague" and the Rubycon story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. For example, the original Xbox (released November 2001) was known for a bad clock capacitor that failed after 6-7 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This capacitor was a PowerStor Aerogel made by Cooper Industries, an American company, and it was a "supercapacitor" with carbon aerogel foam electrodes, not an aluminum E-cap, suggesting it was an unrelated case of capacitor failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

### Weird Timelines
The timeline of failures also suggests a broader issue. While the Rubycon incident was placed in mid-2002, some E-caps continued to fail years later. Intel stated in 2002 that a poor electrolyte E-cap would fail in as little as 250 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Yet, another wave of bulging [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | capacitors]] hit in late 2005, affecting Apple, Hewlett-Packard, and most notably, Dell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. From May 2003 to July 2005, Dell shipped 11.8 million OptiPlex PCs with faulty capacitors that were 10 times more likely to bulge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Dell was sued in 2007 and spent $300 million on replacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. All of Dell's bad [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | capacitors]] came from Nichicon in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. While some industry insiders claimed Nichicon's bad products were made by a Taiwanese sub-contractor, Nichicon itself claimed no plants in Taiwan during the 2002 incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

### High Power and Heat
A more plausible explanation for the widespread failures involves the evolving demands on [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | capacitors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. New Low-ESR aluminum E-caps with water-based electrolytes were introduced in the late 1990s to handle increasingly power-hungry computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. The early 2000s saw Intel and AMD aggressively pushing single-core clock rates, leading to chips (like Dell's Pentium 4) that consumed significant power and generated immense heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. This intense heat likely caused the water-based electrolytes in these new [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | capacitors]] to boil, creating gas that burst their containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The end of the Capacitor Plague coincided with the transition to multi-core CPUs by AMD and Intel starting in 2005, which reduced internal temperatures, and capacitor manufacturers gaining expertise in making stable aqueous electrolytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

### Counterfeits
Another contributing factor was the increasing complexity of the [[market_and_supply_chain_issues_affecting_capacitor_production_and_reliability | supply chain]], with brand-name companies outsourcing parts to no-name suppliers offering the cheapest prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Supply chain disruptions could also pressure OEMs to procure parts from unauthorized distributors, leading to the acquisition of counterfeit [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors_especially_electrolytic_capacitors | capacitors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. A 2014 study of counterfeit Nichicon E-caps, found after the March 2011 earthquake disrupted the legitimate [[market_and_supply_chain_issues_affecting_capacitor_production_and_reliability | supply chain]], revealed their water-based electrolyte lacked sufficient ethylene glycol, which lowered its boiling point and made it unstable at higher temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

## Conclusion
The Capacitor Plague is a complex phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. While the Rubycon [[industrial_espionage_and_its_impact_on_the_capacitor_industry | industrial espionage]] story is a compelling narrative, it is likely an urban legend coexisting with a real technical challenge faced by the capacitor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. Aluminum E-caps with water-based electrolytes are still in use, and while longevity concerns persist, vendors have largely resolved the major issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

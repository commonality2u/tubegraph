Starting in the early 2000s, reports emerged of abnormal numbers of PC motherboards with leaking or even popping capacitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Victims described hearing a loud pop, like a distant firework, and noticing a weird, fishy smell before their computers failed to reboot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Upon inspection, a swollen or burst cylinder on the circuit board was often found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This widespread issue became known as the infamous [[impact_of_faulty_capacitors_on_the_tech_industry | Capacitor Plague]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Beginnings: Understanding Capacitors

A capacitor stores electricity, similar to a battery, but it discharges its energy very quickly, sometimes in a few microseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The basic [[function_and_structure_of_capacitors | structure of a capacitor]] includes two electrically conductive plates, called electrodes (anode and cathode), separated by a material known as the dielectric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The term "capacitor" is conceptually similar to its use in DRAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### E-caps (Electrolytic Capacitors)

[[Electrolytic capacitors and their components | Electrolytic capacitors]], often called E-caps, use an electrolyte as their cathode or negative electrode, which can be solid, gel, or liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. An E-cap consists of two strips of aluminium foil with a thin separator layer of porous paper or tissue in between, saturated with this electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The positive electrode (anode) foil is coated with aluminium oxide, which serves as the dielectric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The entire assembly is rolled up and sealed in a protective aluminium housing to prevent the electrolyte from drying out, often with a vent to release built-up gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

Aluminium E-caps are commonly used due to their good capacitance-to-size and cost ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Their ability to hold charge correlates to the surface area of their electrodes and inversely to the distance between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Manufacturers etch the aluminium foil to increase surface area and use thin separator paper to bring electrodes as close as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Uses in Electronics

A typical PC motherboard might contain around 60 E-caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. A primary use case is filtering; they help smooth out fluctuating DC power from a rectifier into a steady current, charging when voltage peaks and discharging when it dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Capacitors are also crucial for "decoupling," smoothing power supply fluctuations to chips like microprocessors, absorbing voltage spikes and boosting dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. E-caps are not limited to PC motherboards; they are found in camcorders, VCRs, televisions, stereos, and LCD screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

The aluminium E-cap industry was a multi-billion dollar business, worth about $3 to $3.5 billion in 2002 and $5 to $6 billion today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Suppliers, mostly Japanese, Taiwanese, or Chinese, produce billions of units annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. In 2002, Taiwan alone made 22.5 billion E-caps, accounting for 30% of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Failure Modes

Being electrochemical, electrolytic capacitors naturally age and corrode, with a typical lifespan of 10-20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. As they age, their Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) rises, and capacitance slowly declines â€“ a parametric failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Humidity and heat accelerate this aging process, as heat can dry out the electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

However, the Capacitor Plague involved catastrophic failures: bulged capacitors that lost capacitance and caused short circuits, or even exploded and led to fires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. These catastrophic failures began in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## Hints of Defects

Reports of bulged or exploded capacitors largely surfaced in late 2002, though some started earlier, mid-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. An electronics repairman, Gary Headlee, claimed to have replaced 40,000 leaky capacitors on almost 1,500 motherboards in a year starting summer 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. He also noted a significant increase in faulty E-caps in Mitsubishi televisions, JVC VCRs, and Sony camcorders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Carey Holzman, a journalist, began posting online about leaking capacitors in various Taiwan-made motherboards in October 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## The Rubycon Story

The most prominent explanation for the plague was reported by Dennis Zogbi in "Passive Component Industry" magazine in September/October 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. According to his story, a materials scientist from Japanese electronics company Rubycon Corporation left to work for Taiwanese company Luminous Town Electric in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. There, the scientist allegedly replicated Rubycon's P-50 water-based electrolyte formula, which Luminous Town used successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

However, some of the scientist's staffers then defected from Luminous Town, taking the electrolyte formula with them and selling it to other Taiwanese E-cap companies or electrolyte providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The critical flaw was that these defecting staffers allegedly did not have the complete formula, missing additives that prevented hydrogen gas build-up, causing the E-caps to rupture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. While Luminous Town clarified they didn't make the bad electrolyte, they didn't deny stealing the formula from Rubycon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Zogbi reported that 5 to 11 Taiwanese producers were affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

The timeline for this event is debated, with Zogbi indicating mid-2002, though other publications mentioned 2001 or even 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. The IEEE Spectrum magazine noted that the failed E-caps often bore unknown brands or were unmarked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Fallout

Zogbi's report noted that several computer manufacturers confirmed issues with Taiwanese E-cap failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. IBM, for example, stated that a small number of desktop PCs were returned due to capacitor-induced short-circuits, though they termed the problem "minuscule," affecting less than 1% of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. While small in percentage, this still represented significant disruption given the 148.1 million PCs shipped in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Taiwanese motherboard maker ABIT admitted to an E-cap problem and switched from Taiwanese to Japanese suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Despite their honesty, ABIT was sued for selling defective capacitors as early as 1999, which may have led some to peg the plague's start to that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. ABIT settled, repaired the boards, and eventually exited the motherboard business in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

The IEEE Spectrum story even named Lien Yan in Taichung as the electrolyte company accused of buying the flawed formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Lien Yan denied the accusations, stating it heavily damaged their business and that their electrolyte was not used by the suppliers of several bulged capacitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. They dismissed the Rubycon story as FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) spread by the Japanese to regain market share from Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Luxon, a major Taiwanese capacitor supplier, blamed Lien Yan, emphasizing that their own electrolyte development ensured reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

> Luxon definitely understands that the electrolyte is one of the most important materials for aluminum electrolytic capacitors. In order to ensure our reliability and innovative technology Luxon always develops the electrolyte by ourselves. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>

## The Electrolyte's Importance

Luxon's remarks highlight that the electrolyte is not a simple mix but a critical trade secret, determining the capacitor's operating conditions, temperature, voltage, and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. These are complex formulations with many chemical components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

A 2004 report by the Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering at the University of Maryland, requested by a capacitor maker, indicated that the electrolytes in the bulging capacitors were missing a critical additive called a "depolarizer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Depolarizers reduce gas generation within the E-cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Their absence caused the electrolyte to become too alkaline, dissolving the aluminium oxide dielectric and causing the dielectric layer to thin. This led to unnaturally high capacitance, a key indicator of bulging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. The exposed aluminium foil then reacted with impurities, creating electrons that combined with hydrogen ions in the water-based electrolyte to produce hydrogen gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

## Industry-wide Complexity

While the Rubycon industrial espionage story is often associated with the Capacitor Plague, it's skeptical that the entire plague can be blamed on a single defector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. It's more likely an extended series of unconnected challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

### Too Widespread

The problem was widespread, affecting audio equipment, Samsung monitors, and notably, Xboxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. However, the bad capacitor in the original Xbox (released November 2001) that blew after 6-7 years was a PowerStor Aerogel by Cooper Industries, an American company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. This "supercapacitor" used carbon aerogel foam electrodes, not aluminium, indicating an unrelated case of bad capacitor-ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

### Weird Timelines

The timeline is inconsistent with the Rubycon story, which Zogbi placed in mid-2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Experts at the time suggested a poor electrolyte E-cap would fail within a year, possibly as little as 250 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Yet, E-caps continued to blow up into 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

In late 2005, another wave of bulging capacitors affected Apple, Hewlett-Packard, and especially Dell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. From May 2003 to July 2005, Dell shipped 11.8 million OptiPlex PCs with faulty capacitors 10 times more likely to bulge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Dell allegedly hid the issue and was sued in 2007, spending $300 million on replacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. These bad capacitors came from Nichicon in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. Although Zogbi later suggested these were made by a Taiwanese sub-contractor, Nichicon had claimed no plants in Taiwan during the 2002 incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

### High Power and Heat

An alternative explanation points to the challenge of high-speed microprocessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. Dennis Zogbi's 2005 report noted that experts considered it unlikely for 2002 electrolyte to be the cause, suggesting a problem with using water-based electrolytes to decouple new high-speed microprocessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

Low-ESR aluminium E-caps with water-based electrolytes were introduced in the late 1990s to handle increasingly power-hungry computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. The early 2000s saw Intel and AMD aggressively pushing single-core clock rates, leading to chips that consumed a lot of power and generated significant heat, especially notorious Pentium 4 chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. It's plausible that these hotter microprocessors caused the water-based electrolytes in the new capacitors to boil, creating gas that popped their containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The transition to multi-core CPUs by AMD and Intel starting in 2005, which reduced internal temperatures, combined with capacitor makers perfecting aqueous electrolytes, likely contributed to the end of the [[impact_of_faulty_capacitors_on_the_tech_industry | Capacitor Plague]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

### Counterfeits

Another factor contributing to the problem was the increasing complexity of the supply chain and the presence of counterfeits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Brand-name companies outsourced parts to no-name suppliers offering the cheapest prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. When supply chains were disrupted, OEMs might turn to unauthorized distributors, unknowingly purchasing counterfeit capacitors that wouldn't last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. A 2014 study of counterfeit Nichicon E-caps, discovered after the March 2011 earthquake, found their water-based electrolyte lacked enough ethylene glycol, lowering its boiling point and making it unstable at higher temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. This suggests such errors might not have been uncommon.

## Conclusion

The [[impact_of_faulty_capacitors_on_the_tech_industry | Capacitor Plague]] was a complex issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. While the Rubycon incident remains a popular, compelling narrative, it's likely an urban legend intertwined with a genuine technical challenge faced by the capacitor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. Aluminium E-caps with water-based electrolytes are still in use, offering good capacitance for their size and price, and vendors have largely worked out the kinks, allowing these components to once again go unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

[[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Japan's Sharp Corporation]] has historically delivered a variety of [[history_and_impact_of_sharps_consumer_products | iconic products]], including the mechanical pencil, calculators, and TVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, from the turn of the century, the company became increasingly focused on a single, highly competitive business, facing attacks from foreign competitors and financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This led to the company being [[acquisition_of_sharp_by_foxconn | sold to a Taiwanese Electronics giant]], marking the first foreign takeover of a major Japanese consumer electronics company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Early Innovations and Diversification

Takuji Hayakawa, Sharp's founder, opened his own metal workshop in Tokyo at the age of 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. His first notable invention was a belt buckle called the "tokubido," which could be fastened without punching holes into the belt and sold 4,752 pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. In 1915, inspired by a poorly made mechanical pencil, Hayakawa developed a superior version, the "Hayakawa mechanical pencil," which became a hit due to Germany's involvement in World War I limiting imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

After the devastating Great Kanto earthquake in 1923, which destroyed his factory and led to personal tragedy, Hayakawa moved to Osaka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. In 1924, he established Hayakawa Metal Laboratories and began working on the crystal radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Despite no prior knowledge of electricity, he reverse-engineered an imported radio and released their domestically assembled "Sharp" crystal radio in 1925, which was significantly cheaper than foreign competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This coincided with the start of Japan's first radio program by the Tokyo broadcasting station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

Recognizing the limitations of crystal radios, Hayakawa developed the "Sharp-Dyne" series of vacuum tube radios, which could amplify signals and volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. These radios sold exceptionally well, with sales jumping from 58,000 units in 1936 to 130,000 in 1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The company was renamed Hayakawa Electric Company in 1942 and produced various radios, supporting the company through difficult war and post-war periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

In 1953, with technical assistance from RCA, Hayakawa Electric produced Japan's first commercially available television, the "TV314T," which cost 175,000 Yen at a time when an average civil servant earned 8,700 Yen a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This early entry secured their dominance in the domestic television market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. The company also released Japan's first microwave, the R-10, and a solar-powered transistor radio in 1962, remaining a dominant solar cell producer into the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## The Calculator Wars and the Dawn of LCD

In 1960, Hayakawa Electric began designing logic circuits to produce a computer, but without government support for its mainframe computer development program, they shifted focus to non-programmable consumer electronics like calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Inspired by imported desktop calculators, Hayakawa developed the CS-10A "Compet," one of the first all-transistor calculators, which used 530 transistors, weighed 25 kg, and cost about $15,000 in today's USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Despite the price, its initial 300-unit supply sold out quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Subsequent models, like the CS-20A and the CS-31A (the first desktop calculator using integrated circuits), made calculators cheaper and more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. By 1966, Hayakawa led the Japanese calculator industry with a 44% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

In 1970, Hayakawa Electric changed its name to [[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp Corporation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. The company's calculator success triggered intense competition, known as the "calculator Wars," pushing manufacturers to make calculators smaller, cheaper, and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

Calculators at the time used expensive, large, and power-inefficient display tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. In 1969, a Sharp researcher learned about RCA's Dynamic Scattering Mode (DSM) Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Although RCA declined to develop and produce DSM LCD screens for Sharp's calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, Sharp licensed RCA's patents in 1971 and formed a team, S-734, to integrate a DSM LCD into a calculator within 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

After extensive research, Sharp successfully produced the LC-Mate EL-805 in June 1973, featuring an LCD and five ICs on a single glass substrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This revolutionary product was 12 times thinner than competitors, used 1/9000th of the power, lasted 100 hours on a single charge, and weighed only 200 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. By 1985, Sharp had cumulatively sold over 200 million calculator units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## LCD Dominance and Strategic Shift

Sharp continued its LCD research, and in the mid-1980s, discovered IBM's TFT LCD technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. By 1987, Sharp leapfrogged competitors by successfully producing a 14-inch full-color, full-motion LCD display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. In 1991, they debuted the first wall-mounted television, the 9EHC1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

However, the 1990s brought [[challenges_faced_by_sharp_in_the_global_market | difficulties]] as Japan's domestic economy weakened and cheap foreign imports challenged Sharp's older products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Profits declined, and by 1998, net income fell to 24.8 billion yen, a near 50% decline year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. LCD panels and related products became the company's "one bright spot," responsible for 30% of revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

In 1998, new president Katsuhiko Machida repositioned Sharp with LCD business at its center, stating that "every Sharp product will be related to LCD technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Sharp ditched its venerable CRT television business, dating back to 1953, and went all-in on LCD televisions, launching its Aquos TV brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. This bold move paid off initially, with Aquos capturing 80% global market share in the nascent LCD TV market in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. By mid-2003, Aquos dominated the Japanese market with 60% share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

## Challenges and Decline

Despite early success, competition from Taiwan and South Korea, particularly Samsung, rapidly caught up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. In early 2002, Samsung surprised the industry by being the first to produce 5th generation LCDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. To maintain its lead, Sharp invested billions of yen into new TFT LCD factories, including the massive Kamiyama plant, which cost a cumulative 4 billion USD and produced over a million panels a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. Kamiyama represented a significant bet on Japan-based production, as many other Japanese companies had offshored their LCD production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

However, the Kamiyama plant came online at the same time as other massive facilities built by competitors, leading to an oversupply in the LCD panel industry by 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. The price of a 32-inch TV panel plummeted from $865 in 2004 to $149 by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Sharp's TV market share fell from 80% to under 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

Sharp tried to shift focus to selling more LCD panels to other businesses, aiming for 50% external sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. This strategy led to even more investment, including Phase Two of the Kamiyama plant, funded by cutting investment in home appliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. By 2006, LCDs made up half of Sharp's entire revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. Despite record high sales in fiscal year 2008, the target of 50% external sales was never achieved, clearing only 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

In 2007, Sharp announced plans for new factories in Sakai, Osaka prefecture, costing $3.4 billion, projected to produce 13 million units of 32-inch equivalent panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. Sharp sought buyers for these panels, including Sony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. In 2008, Sony agreed to take a 33% ownership share in the Sakai factories (Sharp Display Products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. However, Sharp's internal management issues between its TV and display panel divisions led to Sony receiving poor treatment, causing shortages and delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. Sony eventually sold its entire stake in the joint venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

The global financial crisis in 2008 led to collapsing sales and increased losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. In March 2009, Sharp reported a net loss for the first time since going public in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. Despite admitting mistakes in local production investment, they continued investing in Sakai Display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. By 2009, Sharp's TV market share had fallen to 6-7%, placing it fifth globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. The Sakai plant's operating utilization fell to less than 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. By March 2012, Sharp's sales declined by $10 billion from 2008, and the company reported a net loss of over $5 billion, nearing bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

## Acquisition by Foxconn and Future Direction

In 2012, [[acquisition_of_sharp_by_foxconn | Foxconn]], the Taiwanese electronics giant, bought a 9.9% stake in Sharp for about $854 million and a larger share in Sakai Display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. Foxconn's interest stemmed from its strategy to vertically integrate its supply chain, with displays being the most expensive component in electronics gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. Though Foxconn initially sought a more substantial partnership or acquisition, Sharp declined for several more loss-making years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

Sharp continued to struggle, missing critical industry transitions to new display technologies like LED-backlit LCD screens and OLED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. In March 2013, the company announced a staggering $5 billion loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. By 2013, Sharp and Fujitsu also began losing their grip on the Japanese domestic smartphone market to Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

In 2016, after three more difficult years, Sharp finally accepted Foxconn's offer to purchase a controlling 66% stake for $6.2 billion, though the offer was later revised down to $3.8 billion due to undisclosed financial liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. Sharp's bank creditors ultimately sided with Foxconn, making it the first foreign takeover of a leading Japanese electronics firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.

[[acquisition_of_sharp_by_foxconn | Foxconn]] appointed Tai Jung-woo as Sharp's new CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. He focused on cost-cutting, closing unprofitable overseas ventures, reducing employees, and moving production out of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. In its first full year under Taiwanese management, Sharp turned a small profit for the first time in four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Tai reoriented the company back towards producing branded electronics products and began rebuilding Sharp's semiconductor manufacturing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. In February 2022, Tai retired, and a new CEO from Foxconn, who previously led the brand products division, took over, further indicating the company's future direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

Sharp's journey in the electronics industry highlights its ability to innovate and produce successful products by leveraging technology at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. However, its over-reliance and confidence in the superiority of its LCD technology, coupled with massive investments in a brutal, low-margin display panel business, ultimately led to its decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. The future of the brand under Foxconn's leadership remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.

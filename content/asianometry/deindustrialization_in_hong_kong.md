Deindustrialization, the process of losing the ability to manufacture goods, is considered by some to be Hong Kong's biggest economic mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This shift led to significant changes in the city's economic structure and long-term challenges for its population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Rise of Manufacturing

After the Chinese Civil War, Shanghai industrialists and numerous refugees relocated to Hong Kong to escape the Communist Party of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. These industrialists brought capital and manufacturing expertise, establishing factories in Hong Kong to leverage the labor opportunities provided by about 1 million poor Chinese migrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Due to limited land, Hong Kong's factories produced lightly manufactured items from high-rise buildings, such as plastic flowers, clothes, and radio assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This burgeoning manufacturing industry coincided with a trend starting in the 1950s, where the United States and other Western countries began sourcing manufactured goods from Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. By the early 1960s, Hong Kong became the single biggest manufacturer in the developing world, with these low-skilled jobs helping people earn a living and build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Decline of Manufacturing

Competition soon emerged from places like South Korea and Taiwan, while costs rose due to improving worker salaries and the demand for a richer lifestyle by new generations of Hong Kongers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Hong Kong's manufacturing industries had little to offer beyond cheap labor, lacking the technological expertise to produce native technologies for critical components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Components often had to be imported, for instance, in electronics, city-state OEMs spent 60% of their cost budget on integrated circuits imported from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This made the industry uncompetitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

As early as 1981, manufacturers sought government assistance to upgrade technological capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. In contrast, governments in Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea invested heavily in acquiring and "naturalizing" technologies for commercial use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## British Colonial Administration's Role and the Shift to Services

Hong Kong's unique economic history under British colonial administration played a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The administration likely intended Hong Kong to be primarily a small trading post between China and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The government and trading houses adopted a fiscal compromise: no import or export taxes, with revenue instead generated from land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. In Hong Kong, the government holds superior title to all land and leases it to private parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

This system incentivized an economy based on rising land prices and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. By 1949, Hong Kong's largest companies were banks, land development companies, and trading houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Many former industrialists, such as Li Ka-shing, closed their factories to become landlords, finding it more profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. These dominant companies saw no reason for government intervention to support manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, leading the Hong Kong government to maintain a non-interventionist stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

As a result, manufacturing largely moved elsewhere, primarily to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This led to a significant loss of lower and middle-income jobs in Hong Kong, and the city increasingly focused on finance and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Hong Kong shifted from making and exporting goods to serving as a value-added intermediary for investments and cargo, aided by its British heritage, English laws, and pro-business attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

The service industry's contribution to Hong Kong's GDP dramatically increased:
*   **1980**: 68% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
*   **2000**: 86.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>
*   **2019**: 93.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>

Construction is the second biggest sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Hong Kong's Chief Executives, such as Tung Chee-hwa and Donald Tsang, did not attempt to reverse the demanufacturing trend, instead promoting the view that Hong Kong benefits most when factors of production, capital, and trade flow freely between China and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Consequences and Challenges of the Service Economy Model

The more China reforms and opens up, the less Hong Kong's service economy model benefits its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The Pearl River region has become a top logistics and transport center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, and Shanghai has taken on many of Hong Kong's service economy functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Many mainland Chinese cities have reformed financial restrictions, allowing foreign capital to flow directly into their ports and logistic networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Hong Kong's share of China's trade with the rest of the world has declined significantly:
*   **1997**: 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
*   **2007**: 28% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
*   **2020**: 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>

With the transport, trade, and logistics sectors declining, the only remaining growth engine in Hong Kong has been its [[hong_kongs_financial_services_sector | financial services sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The finance, insurance, and real estate sectors grew from 18% of the economy in 2000 to nearly 30% in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. However, even this sector faces increasing competition as China lifts foreign ownership restrictions on its investing and banking markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. For example, foreign banks were allowed complete ownership of their Chinese subsidiaries in 2020, followed by securities and fund management firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Companies like BlackRock have started offering wholly-owned mutual funds in China, indicating a shift in the financial landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

A major concern for young Hong Kongers is wealth and economic security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, particularly with the [[housing_and_land_issues_in_hong_kong | housing and land issues in Hong Kong]]. Property prices are "obscene" and have far outpaced wage growth, making homeownership unattainable for most young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The Hong Kong government's inability to address this is exacerbated by the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar (since 1983), which removes control over interest rate policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Much of the undeveloped land is held by large land development monopolies, and attempts at housing price reform in the 1990s failed and were rolled back after the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Public spending for housing as a percentage of GDP has not increased since 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Government's New Vision and its Flaws

The Hong Kong government's current policy vision is to foster a society where individuals can work in high-tech industries, invest their earnings, and build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. However, this approach faces significant challenges:

1.  **Lack of High-Paying Jobs**: The financial sector provides less than 10% of the city's jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Nearly 85% of Hong Kong's adult population works for large service-oriented companies (supermarkets, utilities, business services) which are stagnant and dominated by business conglomerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. The anti-competitive nature of established markets makes it hard for new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This contributes to massive wage inequality, with many service workers being over-educated for their roles and having limited career upgrading prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
    *   **Government Efforts**: Since 2016, there has been a shift in attitude. The government aims to open new career pathways for youth by developing emerging industries to foster a knowledge-based economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. These include:
        *   Cultural and creative industries (e.g., games and software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>
        *   Medical services (e.g., medical tourism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>
        *   Education services (e.g., profit and non-profit educational institutions, potentially benefiting from mainland China's crackdown on for-profit education) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>
        *   Testing and certification (e.g., ISO certification for Pearl River area companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>
        *   Innovation and technology (seen as a powerful growth engine for young people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>

2.  **Investment Assets for the Public**: Policies encouraging stock ownership have increased participation in the city's stock markets, making the Hong Kong Stock Exchange a destination for Chinese companies fleeing American markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. However, providing stock exchange accounts is unlikely to help lower classes find wealth or financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. A 2015 survey showed the average Hong Kong retail stock investor was 47 years old and already earning substantially more than the average household income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Stocks are generally a way to *stay* rich, not *get* rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
    *   **Lagging Stock Market Performance**: Hong Kong stocks have not grown fast enough for the average salary earner to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Over 10 years, the Hong Kong 25 50 index fund returned only 8.2% annually, while the benchmark Hang Seng Index fund had a 3.56% total return over five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. In contrast, the S&P 500 returned 16.6% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Many listed Hong Kong companies operate within the city, and actions taken to be shareholder-friendly often increase economic burdens on residents (e.g., mass layoffs, non-standard employment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
    *   **Securitization of Public Assets**: As real estate became too expensive for the average Hong Konger to invest in directly, the government and financial sector sought new assets to package into investment vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
        *   **MTR Privatization**: In 2000, the Hong Kong MTR (railway company and land developer) was partially privatized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. After privatization, it stopped receiving free land grants for railway extensions and focused on profitable land management, advertising, and telecom services, rather than expanding its network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
        *   **The Link REIT**: The government sold car parking and retail facilities for public housing complexes to a real estate investment trust called The Link, ostensibly to raise funds for the housing authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. The Link's IPO was subscribed by retail investors and its value rose significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Subsequently, The Link raised rents, causing economic hardship for many shop owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

While Hong Kong's deindustrialization and focus on services and finance generated wealth for many, leading to a higher GDP, it has come at a considerable cost to the majority of its poorer residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. There was an opportunity for Hong Kong to develop a sophisticated manufacturing sector, such as an electronics industry that could have ascended the technology ladder, potentially even leading to a "Hong Kong TSMC" given its ties with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. By letting this opportunity go, Hong Kong has turned its public goods and even its people into investable assets, leading to economic insecurity and a lack of pathways out for the majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

The Asian financial crisis, which began in 1997, profoundly impacted Indonesia, leading to widespread economic turmoil, the collapse of major business groups, and the end of Suharto's long-standing regime.

## Background: The Rise of Salim Group and Suharto's New Order

Under President Suharto, Indonesia experienced consistent economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This period, known as the New Order, saw the country rebuild its tax base and open up to foreign capital and aid, attracting foreign businesses to set up light manufacturing facilities for goods like shoes and textiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. However, this growth also fostered widespread corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, with a close and corrupt intertwining between the military and the business community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

Suharto crafted a [[crony_capitalism_and_its_role_in_building_indonesias_largest_business_empire | crony capitalist]] political system where rents from economic activities flowed upwards to himself and his inner circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Business partners, often ethnic Chinese, received preferential benefits and protection in exchange for supporting government goals and redistributing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

The Salim Group, founded by Lim Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim), exemplifies this era. At its peak, it was a $22 billion giant, Indonesia's largest business group, and Lim was Southeast Asia's richest man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Lim's rise was directly tied to his personal connection with President Suharto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Key industries dominated by Salim Group included:
*   **Cloves:** In 1966, Salim received one of two exclusive licenses to import cloves, a critical ingredient for Indonesia's *kretek* cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. A small percentage of profits went to Lim, while the majority went to a presidential slush fund, providing early capital for Lim's expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Food (Flour Milling):** Salim founded Bogasari Flour Mills in 1969, which quickly gained a monopoly on wheat import, milling, and distribution for Western Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This became immensely profitable, with 25-35% profit margins, and 26% of the company's profits went to foundations headed by Suharto and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This later expanded into Indofood, a $7 billion conglomerate producing instant noodles, biscuits, milk, and chips, controlling 90% of Indonesia's instant noodle market by the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Cement:** Salim built one of the world's biggest cement companies, controlling 60% of Indonesia's total cement production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. When oil prices tumbled in 1984, Suharto ordered the government to purchase 35% of what is now PT Indocement, bailing out Lim's business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Banking:** Lim transformed a small knitting company with a banking license into Bank Central Asia (BCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. Under Mukhtar Riady, BCA became Indonesia's biggest private bank in just three years, with deposits soaring from 1 billion Rupiah in 1974 to 7.5 trillion Rupiah in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

By 1996, Salim Group's estimated total revenues across all its companies reached $22.8 billion, constituting four percent of Indonesia's total GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

### Pre-Crisis Economic Concerns
Despite robust growth, underlying issues emerged. Suharto, nearing his 70s, became out of touch, and his children began to elbow out trusted advisors, leading to public disapproval due to their incompetence and self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. An infamous example was the 1990 clove monopoly granted to Suharto's youngest son, Tommy, which had to be bailed out by Bank Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

Indonesia's oil export boom ended in 1985, leading to reforms to ease import and export regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. However, by 1994, non-oil exports sputtered, and foreign direct investment declined, largely due to investors like Japan pivoting from Indonesia to China, which was opening up rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. New reforms removed limits on foreign investment and opened new sectors, though protections remained for those dominated by Suharto's children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

A significant concern was the sheer amount of short-term external debt, which doubled from $70 billion in 1990 to $140 billion by mid-1997, with the majority borrowed by the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

## The Crisis Strikes: 1997-1998

On July 2, 1997, Thailand free-floated its currency, initiating a contagion that spread across Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. Foreign capital scrambled to exit, and Bank Indonesia, lacking sufficient reserves, floated the Rupiah in August, causing it to lose over 30% of its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

This devaluation severely impacted Indonesian banks. Their foreign-denominated debt suddenly grew, and $20 billion of that debt had to be repaid within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. Intense competition from 1990s banking reforms, combined with high non-performing loans, left many small banks insolvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. By the end of October 1997, 16 commercial banks closed down, leading to bank runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.

Salim Group's BCA, despite having participated in other bank bailouts previously, faced a massive run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. Rumors of Lim's death and branch closures in Singapore (where BCA had no branches) fueled panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. The run cost BCA $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

## IMF Intervention and Suharto's Fall

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) intervened, announcing a $33 billion bailout package in October 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. This came with stringent economic reform conditions, including:
*   Disassembling state and private monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>
*   Cutting subsidies on basic goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>
*   Further opening up the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>

These demands directly targeted sectors dominated by Suharto's cronies and family, hitting his supporters when he needed them most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. Relations between the government and the IMF deteriorated, with the fund eventually withholding payments, unwilling to support an authoritarian and unpopular regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

Economically, 1998 was devastating:
*   GDP contracted by 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>.
*   The construction sector shrank by 37%, financial by 26.6%, and manufacturing by 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
*   1.8 million formal employees lost their jobs, with possibly another 2.8 million informal employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

Unemployment, combined with skyrocketing food and living costs due to the weak currency and a severe El Ni√±o drought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>, led to widespread social unrest. In May 1998, mass riots broke out in response to fuel subsidy cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. Many of these riots targeted [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_chinese_businesses_in_indonesia | ethnic Chinese]] and their businesses, causing millions in damages and injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. Pro-democracy student demonstrations demanded Suharto's resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. On May 21, 1998, Suharto resigned, ending his 32-year presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

## The Aftermath for Businesses

Lim Sioe Liong was out of the country during the riots, but his home was attacked and set on fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. BCA and other Salim companies suffered massive fire damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. After Suharto's fall, BCA's association with a government crony turned against it, leading to a "titanic run" on the bank, causing its collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. The central bank had to take over BCA and its $5 billion in debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.

The once-massive and largely insolvent Salim Empire began to break apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. BCA's debts to other Salim Group companies threatened the entire conglomerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>. Despite public fury, Lim's son, Anthony Salim, negotiated a settlement: Salim Group handed over its stakes in over 100 Indonesian businesses, including Indocement and Indomobile, to repay the $5 billion government bailout of BCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. Crucially, Salim managed to retain a 50.1% share in Indofood, strategically moving those holdings offshore to their First Pacific financial company in Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. Indofood has since become one of the world's largest food companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.

Lim never returned to Indonesia after 1998 and died in Singapore in 2012 at age 95, with an estimated net worth of $655 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.

While Suharto's governance brought substantial economic benefits and the development of an agricultural and manufacturing base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>, the crisis exposed the vulnerability of a system built on [[crony_capitalism_and_its_role_in_building_indonesias_largest_business_empire | crony capitalism]] and short-term debt, ultimately leading to widespread economic collapse and political upheaval.

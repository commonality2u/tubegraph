The Soviet Union's early attempts to create a moneyless society led to a devastating economic period known as War Communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This approach, stemming from [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Bolshevik]] ideology and influenced by Karl Marx's views on money as a tool of capitalist exploitation and cyclical crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, aimed to eliminate money entirely in favor of a centrally planned system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Economic Chaos Under War Communism

Upon taking power in 1917, the [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Bolsheviks]] inherited an economy already reeling from World War I. The Imperial government had abandoned the gold standard in June 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, faced massive deficits (39% in the first year of war, 75% in the next two) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, and experienced high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. By early 1917, paper rubles in circulation had increased to 9 billion from 1.6 billion in July 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The 1917 deficit was 82% of the budget, with 73% funded by printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Further exacerbating the crisis, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918 resulted in Russia losing significant population, agricultural land, and over half its industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The subsequent Russian Civil War (1918-1921) further devastated the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Policies of Demonetization

The [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Bolsheviks]] implemented several radical policies:
*   **Bank Nationalization** Marx believed banking was central to capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Bolsheviks]] declared a state monopoly on banking, seizing the Russian State Bank (Goss Bank) in November 1917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. By late 1918, all banks were liquidated and merged into Goss Bank, which ceased lending money and merely kept transaction accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This cut off credit, leading to 405 enterprises closing in early 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Industrial Nationalization** In June 1918, the Council of People's Commissar announced nationalization of industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This chaotic process, largely done by local organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, ejected skilled workers and led to mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Hyperinflation** Despite aiming for a moneyless society, the [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Bolsheviks]] printed vast amounts of rubles to fund their budget, as foreign loans were unavailable and taxes provided little revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Inflation hit 598% by the end of 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, and 1,376% in 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. In 1921, 16.3 trillion new rubles were issued, and 1.97 quadrillion in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Amazingly, the [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Bolsheviks]] argued this hyperinflation was evidence their socialist transformation was working, aiming to devalue money to nothing and transition to state distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   **Food Requisitioning** To address food shortages, the government continued the Tsarist-era grain monopoly, requiring farmers to sell surpluses at fixed prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The crashing ruble made wages worthless, disincentivizing peasants from selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. In May 1918, a "food dictatorship" permitted armed force to seize food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Payment in Kind** By 1921, 93% of wages were paid in physical goods rather than cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. Proposed alternative accounting units, like the "tread" (a day of simple labor), proved confusing and impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

## Economic Collapse and the New Economic Policy

By 1921, the Russian economy was in ruins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Production of items like steel, sugar, and bricks practically ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, with overall industrial output falling to a third of pre-war levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Without money, there was no incentive to work, leading to high desertion rates and drastically reduced worker productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Daily caloric intake plummeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, and a famine in 1921-1922 resulted in 5 million deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Peasant revolts, notably the Kronstadt rebellion in 1921, shook Lenin's confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

### Reversal of Monetary Policies

Recognizing the dire situation, Lenin realized that market activity had to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. In March 1921, the **New Economic Policy (NEP)** was implemented to reverse the decline, grow output, and stabilize the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

Key aspects of the reversal:
*   **Currency Reintroduction:** By 1923, the Soviet government fully reversed course, issuing a gold-backed currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
*   **Central Bank Independence:** The Central Bank was made independent again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Budget Rebalancing:** The government worked to rebalance its budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

As a result, rebellions subsided, and economic output began to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Lenin reflected on the period, stating:
> "We were caught up as we were in the wave of enthusiasm and having kindled the people's enthusiasm first general political and then military enthusiasm we were counting on utilizing this enthusiasm directly to accomplish economic tasks that were equally important life has shown how wrong we were" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>

While Lenin attributed the failures of War Communism to civil war interruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, the state's initial intention was indeed to eradicate money and tear the country away from capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. These plans, however, led to chaos, violence, and a catastrophic collapse in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

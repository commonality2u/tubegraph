The semiconductor industry is characterized by significant volatility, with booms rapidly following busts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Even in normal times, conditions are unpredictable, with semiconductor shipments capable of soaring 70% in one year and crashing 40% the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Currently, the industry is working through a major chip shortage, but the widespread expansion of fabs raises questions about how soon this might turn into a glut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Dynamics of Demand

End users do not directly purchase microchips in large quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Instead, chips are bought by vendors who integrate them into consumer goods like PCs and smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The rapid pace of new product releases often renders current iterations obsolete, putting pressure on foundry customers to receive chips quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Customer Behavior: Double Booking
Concerns about securing stock, particularly during uncertain times, can lead customers to "double book" orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. TSMC Chairman Mark Liu identified double booking as a significant reason why the recent chip shortage was not as severe as it appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Geopolitical Tensions

[[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_and_geopolitical_tensions | Geopolitical factors]] contribute to double booking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. TSMC's Mark Liu specifically cited recent China-America trade tensions as a more significant concern than the pandemic in causing double booking, noting that this trend is likely to continue as long as tensions persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Macroeconomic Impact

Demand for semiconductors is heavily influenced by the broader macro-economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Since electronics are consumer items, consumers tend to buy fewer iPhones and laptops when economic conditions are difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Historically, several downturns in the semiconductor business cycle have been linked to major economic events:
*   **Oil Shocks**: Three downturns in 1975, 1982, and 1991 were attributed to oil shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Asian Financial Crisis**: The crisis of 1998 also led to a downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Impact of the Pandemic

In March 2020, as the global economy seemed to be collapsing, stock markets were down 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Companies responded by cutting expenses and hunkering down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. However, an unforeseen flurry of stimulus packages and monetary expansion led to an unexpectedly rapid economic bounce back in Q3 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Over-supply vs. Under-demand

While macroeconomics is a common topic, a 2005 study found that semiconductor down cycles are triggered more significantly by surges in semiconductor inventory levels and fab capacity, rather than a decrease in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This suggests that over-supply, rather than under-demand, is often the primary driver of downturns in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Current Build-out and Future Outlook

The industry is currently experiencing a significant global build-out of fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   TSMC is constructing its Arizona fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, with whispers of an upscaled size from the original plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Once completed, this facility alone could produce 25,000 to 100,000 wafer starts per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   Samsung is negotiating a multi-billion dollar investment to expand its Austin fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   Even smaller, second-tier foundries are expanding or upgrading their capacity, with numerous press releases about new sites and projects, many not under 10nm process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   Global Foundries is investing $1.4 billion in expansion and moving up its IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   SMIC is receiving $2.35 billion from the Shenzhen government for a new wafer fab, expected to produce 40,000 wafers a month by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

This represents hundreds of thousands of wafers entering the market over the next one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. It is unlikely that current demand, especially as people return to school and offices, will sustain this massive influx of capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. For context, the U.S. Department of Defense buys 1.9 billion semiconductors per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, while a single TSMC Arizona fab at 50,000 wafers a month could theoretically produce 3.5 billion dies *in one month* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. This significant build-out suggests that while semiconductors are currently experiencing a boom, a subsequent bust may be inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

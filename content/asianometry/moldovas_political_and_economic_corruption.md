Moldova, a small Eastern European country, is one of the poorest and most corrupt nations in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Over two decades, politicians enriched businessmen, who then became politicians themselves, seizing control of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. One individual, Vladimir Plahotniuc, amassed immense [[Oligarchic control and influence in Moldova | oligarchic wealth]] and secretly controlled the entire country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Post-Soviet Transition and Economic Collapse

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moldova faced daunting challenges, including a complete re-evaluation of its identity, economy, and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The economy was collapsing, shrinking by an average of seven percent annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The country experienced hyperinflation, with monthly inflation rates reaching 75 percent in the first half of 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. By the end of 1992, 79 percent of Moldovans had fallen into poverty because the government could not adjust salaries and pensions to match the new prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

The most industrialized region, Transnistria, became de facto independent, further hindering Moldova's economic recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. To stabilize the situation, the new government aimed to transition to a market economy by 1996, focusing on liberalizing trade and privatizing state property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Flawed Privatization and the Rise of Oligarchs

The privatization of state-owned firms and agricultural land, though legislated in 1991, did not begin until 1993 due to political squabbling and lack of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. The execution of these reforms was deeply flawed:
*   Company managers with inside knowledge bought shares at extremely low prices or simply stole the best assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   Agricultural land distribution, mostly occurring between 1998 and 2000, was also botched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Workers received plots without considering land quality or fertility, and sometimes multiple people received the same assets or disconnected plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   "Smart people in the know" exploited the land reform scheme to assemble massive parcels of fertile land, creating private ownership of estates reminiscent of old Soviet collective farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

Ultimately, state privatization schemes failed to achieve their goals, instead enriching a select group of connected individuals and creating a class of [[Oligarchic control and influence in Moldova | oligarchs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. By 1997, Moldova's GDP had plummeted to just 35 percent of its level a decade earlier, and over 50 percent of the population still lived in poverty, on less than $2.15 a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. The black market accounted for 70 percent of the country's livelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. By 2005, 20 percent of the population had emigrated, making personal remittances a primary source of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Moldova also continues to struggle with an organ trafficking issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## The Return of the Communists and Deepening Corruption

In 2001, the Communist Party of Moldova, led by Vladimir Voronin, surged back into power, winning 49.9 percent of the vote by appealing to nostalgia for the Soviet era and promising free healthcare and closer ties with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. They became the only post-Soviet Communist party to regain power after the Soviet collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Once in power, they consolidated their rule using a strong organizational base inherited from the Soviet days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

The 2000s marked a decade of theft and corruption, as party politicians infiltrated the Moldovan economy, enriching themselves and their families by transferring public assets into private hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Vladimir Voronin's son, Oleg, headed a business empire in banking, construction, and railway, receiving over 2,000 rich government contracts during his father's eight years in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Oleg Voronin is arguably Moldova's first billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

Vladimir Voronin also developed strong relations with businessman Vladimir Plahotniuc, who became one of his closest advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Plahotniuc, initially an economist who began exporting wine to Russia in 1996, rose to become vice chairman of Victoria Bank, one of Moldova's largest banks, by 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. By the end of the 2000s, Moldova had 70 billionaires whose combined wealth accounted for 138 percent of the reported GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Plahotniuc himself was worth an estimated two billion dollars, making him the richest man in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

## Oligarchs Enter Politics: Plahotniuc's Ascendance

In 2009, the Communists lost power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Following parliamentary elections, tens of thousands protested alleged rigging in what was called the "Twitter Revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. Sensing an opportunity, Plahotniuc defected from the Communist Party to the Democratic Party of Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Despite his obscure background, his vast wealth and media ownership allowed him to quickly dominate the party and become one of Moldova's most powerful leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

Plahotniuc shared power for five years with Vlad Filat, another Moldovan billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Filat became rich through illegal trade with Romania and then acquired state assets while serving as the state secretary for privatization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. The two officially were partners, needing each other for a parliamentary majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. They carved up the country's government into their own fiefdoms: Filat controlled financial regulators and the Ministry of Economy, while Plahotniuc solidified control of the judiciary and law enforcement, which proved to be a crucial weapon against his rival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

### The "Robbery of the Century" and Plahotniuc's Consolidation of Power

Their uneasy alliance fell apart after news emerged of a hunting trip scandal in December 2012, where a bystander was shot and killed during an illegal hunting trip attended by senior members of the judiciary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Filat attempted to force out the prosecutor general, a member of Plahotniuc's faction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. In response, Plahotniuc launched his own anti-corruption drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

Filat's gambit failed when an even larger scandal erupted in November 2014: three Moldovan banks were taken over and forced to issue nearly three billion dollars in bad loans, approximately 15 percent of the country's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. This money was laundered through shell companies into Latvian banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. When the loans defaulted, the banks collapsed, and the Moldovan National Central Bank secretly bailed them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. To cover this secret bailout, the Ministry of Finance was forced to issue a billion dollars in 25-year bonds, burdening Moldovan citizens for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. This scheme, masterminded by Israeli-born Moldovan [[Oligarchic control and influence in Moldova | oligarch]] Ilan Shor, was dubbed the "robbery of the century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. The Moldovan currency devalued by over 40 percent, leading to an explosion of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

Protests against corruption drew over 100,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Ilan Shor was arrested and implicated, and in exchange for leniency, he implicated former Prime Minister Filat, who was stripped of immunity and arrested for corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. With Filat removed, Plahotniuc consolidated his power, though he was rejected by the president for the prime minister position due to a lack of integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Despite being disliked, with a 95 percent disapproval rating, Plahotniuc was the richest and most powerful man in Moldova, controlling state-owned companies, financial flows, and four out of five TV stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. For three years in the mid to late 2010s, he effectively captured the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

## Plahotniuc's Fall from Power

In February 2019, parliamentary elections resulted in a hung parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. Unexpectedly, the pro-European ACUM alliance and the pro-Russian Socialist Party, despite their opposing leanings, formed an alliance to remove Plahotniuc from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. This new alliance, backed by the EU, US, and Russia, formed a government in June 2019 with Maia Sandu as prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

Plahotniuc attempted to stop this by cutting power to the Parliament building and having the Constitutional Court invalidate the new government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. However, unified international pressure forced the Constitutional Court to reverse its decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. The Democratic Party conceded power, and Plahotniuc fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

Moldova continues to be a profoundly poor and corrupt society, requiring significant time and effort to reverse the damage from decades of poorly executed policies and bad actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

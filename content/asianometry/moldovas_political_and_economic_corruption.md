Moldova, a small and impoverished country in Eastern Europe, has been plagued by immense corruption over two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Initially, politicians enriched businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Subsequently, these businessmen entered politics and effectively seized control of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. One individual, in particular, amassed immense [[oligarchs_and_political_power_in_moldova | oligarchic wealth]] and controlled the entire country from behind the scenes, until his influence eventually collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Geographic and Historical Context

The Republic of Moldova is a landlocked country situated between Romania to its west and Ukraine on its north, east, and south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Most of its land lies between the Prut and Dniester Rivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Its official size is approximately 33,800 square kilometers, slightly smaller than Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The terrain consists mostly of forested hills and steppes, with moderate winters and warm summers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Moldova possesses Europe's third most arable land per capita, leading to 40% of its population engaging in farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Wine is a well-known export, with a prestigious wine culture dating back to the early 1800s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. During its agricultural peak in the [[history_of_moldova_and_its_Soviet_past | Soviet years]], Moldova produced 30% of the world's tobacco and 20% of its total grape harvest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Moldova has a complex [[history_of_moldova_and_its_Soviet_past | history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The modern Republic can be traced to the Principality of Moldova, founded in the 14th century, which was a vassal state to the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. In 1812, the Ottoman Empire ceded a large portion of the old principality (over 45,000 square kilometers between the Prut and Dniester Rivers) to the Russian Empire via the Treaty of Bucharest, ending the Russo-Turkish War of 1806-1812 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This area, known as Bessarabia, remained under Russian control for a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The remaining parts of the old Moldovan principality, west of the Prut River, later joined Wallachia in the 19th century to form the Kingdom of Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

After the Russian Revolution, the Moldovan lands between the Prut and Dniester shifted between various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. They declared independence and joined "Greater Romania," a move never recognized by the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. In 1939, a non-aggression pact between the Soviets and Germans left Romania without an ally against Soviet expansionism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The Soviets demanded Bessarabia, acquiring it in June 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), the second smallest Soviet Republic, was then founded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Stalin aggressively persecuted those exposed to non-communist systems, purging the country through deportations and executions as part of an ideological cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Romania, aligning with the Axis powers, reinvaded the area in 1941 as part of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, holding it until the Soviets retook control in 1944 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The Soviets found a land devastated by war, followed by a massive famine, collectivization, and another wave of deportations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The Moldovan SSR's leadership was dominated by ethnic Russians and Ukrainians, with ethnic Moldovans rarely reaching higher echelons of power, unless they were from the Transnistria region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This region, fully integrated into Russian culture, had a population of about 50% Russians and Ukrainians, with a sizable Moldovan minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Transnistria was the Moldovan SSR's most industrialized region, providing 90% of the area's power despite comprising only 12% of its land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

In the late 1980s, tensions between the ethnic Moldovan majority and the Soviets led to strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Two opposition organizations formed the Popular Front, a diverse group advocating for Romanian reunification, state sovereignty, or communist reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. In late 1989, a Popular Front rally drew 500,000 people demanding full sovereignty and Soviet troop withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. In 1990, they won most seats in the Moldova Supreme Soviet, breaking the Communist Party's monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. In May 1991, the Moldovan SSR renamed itself the Republic of Moldova, declaring independence from the collapsing Soviet Union a few months later in August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

The Popular Front leadership advocated for reunification with Romania, adopting a flag with Romanian elements and loosening border controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This alarmed Moldova's ethnic minorities (about 35% of the population), especially in the pro-Russian Transnistria area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Consequently, Transnistria declared independence in December 1991, leading to a brief war ending in a ceasefire in July 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Moldova failed in its goals, and although reunification with Romania seemed inevitable, the Moldovan people blamed the leadership for military blunders and the deteriorating [[privatization_and_economic_challenges_in_postsoviet_moldova | economic challenges]], voting them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Post-Soviet Economic Collapse and Flawed Privatization

Like other post-Soviet states, Moldova faced daunting challenges, including a wholesale remaking of its identity, economy, and government simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The ailing economy was collapsing rapidly, shrinking an average of seven percent annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The country experienced hyperinflation, with a monthly inflation rate of 75% in the first six months of 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. By the end of 1992, 79% of Moldovans fell into poverty as the government could not adjust salaries and pensions to new prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Adding to the problem, Transnistria, Moldova's most industrialized area, was de facto independent and beyond its reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

To stabilize the situation, the new government announced a transition to a functional market economy by 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This system would involve two key elements:
1.  **Trade Liberalization:** Prices of essential goods like milk, eggs, and bread would be set by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
2.  **[[privatization_and_economic_challenges_in_postsoviet_moldova | Privatization]] of State Property:** Shares in state-owned firms and land from collective and state-owned farms would be distributed to the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The government implemented these [[government_reforms_and_international_relations | reforms]] quickly, hoping for a swift "shock therapy" recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. However, this occurred amidst immense ethnic tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Years of Soviet oppression cultivated strong anti-Russian sentiments among some, while many Moldovans still supported closer ties with Russia, like the Transnistrians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Romanian nationalists continued to advocate for reunification, citing historical and linguistic similarities, but this too had its detractors who championed Moldova's continued independence, potentially with aspirations of joining the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. These complex, multifaceted feelings caused significant cleavages in governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

Unlike states like Belarus that quickly reverted to authoritarianism, Moldova's weak state, dire economy, and deeply divided populace prevented a single authority from initially rising to political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Throughout the 1990s, the Moldovan government saw several competitive elections and peaceful transfers of presidential and parliamentary power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Two incumbent presidents, Mircea Snegur (1996) and Petru Lucinschi (2001), stepped aside for their successors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. The media was openly critical, and other branches of government managed to curb presidential powers, as seen when the judiciary struck down a presidential attempt to fire a general in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

Despite this apparent competition, the official channels of governance stopped working, leading people to rely on informal relationships like clans and patrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This parallel structure planted the seeds for unparalleled amounts of corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### Economic Hardship Continues

The Moldovan people's situation did not improve throughout the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Economic relief efforts came years too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Inflation persisted until 1994, when a new currency, the Moldovan leu, was introduced, and salary/pension indexing didn't arrive until 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

[[privatization_and_economic_challenges_in_postsoviet_moldova | Privatization]] legislation passed in 1991 but only began in 1993 due to political squabbling and lack of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Its execution was bungled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Shares of state-owned companies were distributed to workers and the public, but company managers, having inside knowledge, either bought shares at obscenely low prices or simply pilfered the best assets for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Agricultural land distribution was similarly flawed, with most distribution occurring between 1998 and 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Workers received plots without regard to land quality or fertility; some got vineyards, others rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Sometimes, multiple people received the same asset (like a cow or tractor), or plots were disconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Astute individuals in the know exploited their positions in the land reform scheme to assemble massive parcels of fertile land, creating private ownership similar to the old Collective Farms of the Soviet age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

Overall, state [[privatization_and_economic_challenges_in_postsoviet_moldova | privatization]] schemes failed to achieve their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Instead, they enriched a select group of connected individuals, creating a class of [[oligarchs_and_political_power_in_moldova | oligarchs]], while citizens remained cripplingly poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. By 1997, Moldova's GDP had fallen to just 35% of what it was a decade earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Over 50% of the population still lived in poverty (less than $2.15/day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Many turned to the black market, which contributed 70% of the country's livelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. A 2000 poll found 91% of people dissatisfied with their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. By 2005, 20% of the population had emigrated, making personal remittances one of Moldova's largest income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. A 2001 BBC report highlighted Moldovans willing to sell their kidneys for money, and the country continues to struggle with organ trafficking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## Return of the Communists and the Rise of New Oligarchs

In 2001, the Communist Party of Moldova, led by Vladimir Voronin, surged back into power, winning 49.9% of the vote and 71 of 101 parliamentary seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. They capitalized on nostalgia for the "good old Soviet days," promising free healthcare and closer ties with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. They were the only post-Soviet Communist party to recapture power after the Soviet collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Once in power, they consolidated rule using their strong organizational base inherited from the Soviet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

In his first term, Voronin attempted to orient the country towards Russia, proposing expanded Russian language learning in schools and a potential deal with Putin to resolve the Transnistrian issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. However, domestic and international pushback thwarted these plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. For the 2005 presidential elections, Voronin proposed bringing Moldova into the EU, a platform that proved genuinely popular despite Moldova's slim chances of membership at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. The Communist Party won 46.1% of the parliamentary vote, and Voronin formed a coalition to remain president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

The 2000s became a decade of theft and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Party politicians gradually infiltrated the remaining Moldovan economy, enriching themselves and their families by transferring public assets to private hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Vladimir Voronin's son, Oleg, headed a business empire in banking, construction, and railway, with his companies receiving over 2,000 rich government contracts during Voronin's eight years in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Oleg is arguably Moldova's first billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

Voronin also forged strong relations with businessman Vladimir Plahotniuc, who became one of his closest advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Plahotniuc, the son of a teacher, initially worked as an economist for a foreign company (1991-1993) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. In 1996, he began exporting wine to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Five years later, he became vice-chairman of VictoriaBank, one of Moldova's largest banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. By the end of the 2000s, Moldova had 70 billionaires, whose combined wealth accounted for 138% of the reported GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Plahotniuc alone was worth two billion dollars, making him the richest man in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

### The "Twitter Revolution" and Oligarchs in Power

In 2009, the Communists lost power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. After parliamentary elections in April showed the Communists winning 49.48% of the vote and 60 seats, tens of thousands of young people protested, claiming the results were rigged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. As these protests were organized on Twitter, two years before a similar event in Egypt, the incident was dubbed the "Twitter Revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

Parliament failed to reach a resolution and dissolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Seizing the opportunity, Plahotniuc and another colleague defected from the Communist Party to the nominally European-oriented Democratic Party of Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Despite his sudden emergence (the Moldovan media lacked a photograph of him in 2010), Plahotniuc quickly dominated the party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. With his wealth and resources (he owned his own media company), he rose to become one of the country's most powerful leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. While politicians had previously enriched businessmen, now businessmen were entering politics themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

For the next five years, Plahotniuc shared power with his coalition partner, Vlad Filat, another Moldovan billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Filat amassed wealth through illegal trading with Romania and by purchasing state assets while serving as the state secretary for privatization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. After the Communists returned to power, Filat founded the Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova and resisted their growing authoritarianism, eventually serving as prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

Plahotniuc and Filat, officially partners, needed each other to secure a parliamentary majority and maintain power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Between them, they carved up the country's government into their own fiefdoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. Filat controlled financial regulators and the Ministry of Economy, which managed foreign assistance funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Plahotniuc, crucially, solidified control of the judiciary and law enforcement, which proved to be the decisive weapon against his rival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

The rivalry escalated when Filat targeted Plahotniuc after news emerged of a December 2012 scandal involving an illegal hunting trip at Padurea Domneasca National Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Senior judiciary members attended the illegal trip, during which a young bystander was shot and killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. They attempted to cover it up, but news leaked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. Filat tried to force out the country's prosecutor general, a member of Plahotniuc's clan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. In retaliation, Plahotniuc launched anti-corruption drives, and the uneasy alliance collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

### The "Robbery of the Century"

Filat's gambit failed, as an even larger scandal erupted in November 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. It was revealed that three Moldovan banks were taken over and forced to issue nearly three billion dollars in bad loans, equivalent to about 15% of the country's entire GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. The money was laundered through shell companies and ended up in Latvian banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. When these loans were predictably not repaid, the banks collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. The Moldovan National Central Bank then secretly bailed them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. To cover this secret bailout, the Ministry of Finance was forced to issue a billion dollars in 25-year bonds, meaning the Moldovan people would pay for this theft for over a quarter-century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. The Moldovan currency devalued by over 40%, causing inflation to skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

This sophisticated scheme, masterminded by Israeli-born Moldovan [[oligarchs_and_political_power_in_moldova | oligarch]] Ilan Shor, was dubbed the "robbery of the century" by Moldovan media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. Opposition parties called for action, leading to protests of over 100,000 people against corruption, the largest since independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Shor was arrested and implicated, and in exchange for leniency, prosecutors stripped former Prime Minister Filat of immunity and arrested him for corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. Filat's assets were seized, and he was sentenced to prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

With no one left in his way, Plahotniuc consolidated power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. He attempted to formally become Prime Minister but was rejected by the president for not meeting the necessary criteria of integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. The quintessential backroom power broker, despite his immense influence, could not make this final step into the limelight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. Fundamentally, he was profoundly disliked, with a 95% disapproval rating and just a 2% trust rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

By this time, Plahotniuc was the richest and most powerful man in Moldova, with a fortune worth over 30% of the country's GDP ($2.2 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. His clan of family members and close associates controlled state-owned companies, financial flows, and four out of the five country's TV stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. By the mid to late 2010s, Moldovans had lost trust in their government; a September 2016 poll found that 80% felt their country was heading in the wrong direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. For three years, Plahotniuc truly captured the state, controlling media, judiciary, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. He attempted to solidify his power by "reforming" election policies in 2017 to create a shadow voting system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. Although his party was nominally pro-European, Plahotniuc lacked a particular ideology, caring only for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. For instance, in 2016, he backed Igor Dodon of the pro-Russian populist Socialist Party for president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

## Plahotniuc's Downfall

Abruptly, Plahotniuc lost everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. In February 2019, Moldova held parliamentary elections to form a government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. The major winners included the pro-European ACUM alliance (the anti-Plahotniuc party), Dodon's pro-Russian Socialist Party, and Plahotniuc's Democratic Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. The fourth significant winner was the Shor party, led by Ilan Shor, the mastermind of the Billion Dollar Bank theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

No party won an outright majority, resulting in a hung Parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. Unexpectedly, ACUM and the Socialists joined forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. This was surprising given Dodon's pro-Russian stance and previous backing by Plahotniuc, but Dodon's Russian patrons reportedly forbade an alliance with Plahotniuc, fearing loss of influence over the Socialist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. Despite their opposing leanings, the two reluctantly cooperated to remove Plahotniuc from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. This strange new alliance, backed by the EU, US, and Russia, formed a government in June 2019 with ACUM's Maia Sandu as Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

Plahotniuc did everything he could to stop this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. He literally cut power to the Parliament building the night of the announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. Soon after, he had the Constitutional Court invalidate the new government and reinstate the old one, an unprecedented move that resulted in two governments vying for power simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. However, after sustained unified international pressure, the Constitutional Court reversed its decision a week later, acknowledging their bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. The Democratic Party relinquished power, and Plahotniuc fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

## Conclusion

Moldova began its independence with a difficult start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Decades under the Soviet Union left the country ethnically divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. It struggled through a threefold transition in governance, economy, and national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. These divisions facilitated the rise of an [[oligarchs_and_political_power_in_moldova | oligarch]] who captured the state for personal financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. An entire nation had to unite to evict them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>.

Nearly five years after Plahotniuc's fall, Moldova remains a profoundly poor and corrupt society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Reversing the damage from decades of poorly executed policies and corrupt individuals will require significant time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

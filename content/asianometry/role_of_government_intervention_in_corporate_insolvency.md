Hanjin Shipping, once South Korea's largest container shipping line and a national pride, abruptly filed for reorganization in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This unexpected insolvency caused global chaos in the shipping industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The company, which had been the world's fourth-biggest container line in 2016, with 97 ships and calls on 90 ports in over 35 countries, sailed into troubled waters after the 2008 global financial crisis caused freight rates to crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Early Government Support and Industry Development

Hanjin Shipping was established as a branch of the Hanjin Group, one of South Korea's *chaebol* (large business groups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The Hanjin Group began in 1945 with founder Cho Chun-hun, who initially secured jobs trucking military supplies for the US Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. To fund Hanjin's expansion after the Korean War, Cho turned to the national government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. President Park Chung-hee's economic growth plan provided loyal companies with generous loans from state banks, from which Hanjin Group profited handsomely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

In 1977, Cho founded Hanjin Shipping, a decade after first encountering containerized shipping in Vietnam during the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Hanjin Shipping was intended to be the business group's "Crown Jewel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Recognizing the importance of maritime shipping for an economy dependent on trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, the Korean government decided to develop its indigenous container capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. New policies encouraged the first generation of containerized shipping lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. By 1976, the government explicitly began subsidizing Korean container carriers, establishing the Korea Maritime and Port Administration to guide the industry's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Hanjin Shipping emerged at the opportune time to leverage this national policy push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

During the 1979 oil crisis and subsequent macroeconomic slowdown, the Korean government consolidated its shipping lines from 70 to 20 and offered aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. While Hanjin Shipping did not receive a public bailout, its sister company Korean Air temporarily stepped in to help in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Korean government carefully managed the shipping industry, restricting companies to specific routes and blocking new domestic entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This management, alongside a massive Korean export boom, allowed Hanjin to become the largest container shipping line in South Korea and the world's 13th largest by 1988 through organic growth and mergers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. By 1997, after acquiring Germany's DSR Senator, Hanjin became the fourth largest shipping line globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Impact of IMF Reforms on Industry Structure

The Asian financial crisis in 1997 led to Korea needing a financial bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This IMF assistance came with strict conditions, including policy changes aligned with neoliberal governance beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Two significant changes impacting Hanjin Shipping were:
1.  **Market Liberalization**: The Korean government was compelled to liberalize its shipping business, opening the market to foreign players much faster than initially planned, exposing Korean shippers to full competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
2.  **Debt Reduction Mandate**: Korean business conglomerates were mandated to reduce their debt-to-equity ratios to below 200% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This forced Hanjin Shipping, among others, to sell off owned ships to pay down debt and charter new ships to maintain capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Hanjin, for instance, had to perform "sale-leaseback" transactions for 29 of its ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. While improving debt ratios, this increased operating costs significantly due to higher short-term charter prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This combination of higher operating costs and new foreign competition led to a long-term decline in Korea's indigenous shipping lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## Financial Distress and the Bailout Decision

By 2014, Hanjin Shipping's debt had soared to 440 billion won (approximately $375 million USD), up from 195 billion won ($165 million USD) in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. To address this, Hanjin began selling off its most profitable assets, including domestic and overseas terminals, and its liquefied natural gas tanker and bulk shipping divisions, leaving only the volatile container shipping line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

In 2016, Korea Development Bank (KDB), Hanjin's largest creditor, demanded 700 billion won ($615 million USD), but the company could only offer 500 billion won ($440 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. The last resort was a government bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

### Comparison with Other National Bailouts

Many other countries had bailed out their shipping lines during similar crises:
*   Denmark lent $6 billion to Maersk in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   Germany lent $1.8 billion to Hapag-Lloyd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.
*   France lent $660 million to CMA CGM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
*   China gave $9.5 billion to Cosco and China Shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

### The Korean Government's Stance

Despite these precedents, KDB, which also had to deal with Hyundai Merchant Marine, required Hanjin to restructure its chartering contracts, cut debt further, and receive capital injections from its ownership family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. While Hyundai was able to comply, Hanjin could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

The Korean government's decision not to bail out Hanjin had echoes of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. The stated rationale was that nobody wants to "shovel taxpayer money to corporate fat cats," especially to the family of the "nut rage lady" (referring to the daughter of Hanjin Group chairman Cho Yang-ho) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

### Consequences of Non-Intervention
Hanjin's August 2016 insolvency caused immense market disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>:
*   159 companies found their cargo unable to be delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   Hanjin stopped paying terminal fees, leaving $4 billion worth of goods stranded at sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   This included critical Korean export goods, as Hanjin shipped 40% of Samsung's electronics and 20% of LG's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.
*   Walmart had 3,000 containers at sea or in terminals due to Hanjin's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.
*   Tens of thousands of shipyard jobs were annihilated in Korea and the Philippines, where Hanjin owned the Subic Bay Shipyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

Despite vigorous protests from trade groups and unions, the Korean government stood firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

## Alternative Government Approaches

Other nations adopted different strategies for their national shipping champions:
*   **Singapore**: Facing similar decisions with Neptune Orient Lines (NOL), Singapore opted to divest itself of the industry, selling NOL to French operator CMA CGM for $2.4 billion USD shortly before Hanjin's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. NOL's division subsequently turned a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
*   **Taiwan**: In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Taiwan government bailed out its own two container shipping lines, Evergreen and Yang Ming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. Taiwan's Deputy Minister of Transportation stated the nation relies on shipping firms to transport large quantities of goods, which is key to economic development, and that Hanjin's collapse demonstrated the need for government support "before the damage becomes uncontrollable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

## Conclusion

Hanjin Shipping's demise was primarily due to two factors:
1.  A working capital crisis despite owning profitable assets, exacerbated by poor chartering practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. The splitting of the founder's transportation empire after his death meant no wealthy sibling company could provide a bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
2.  The Korean government's decision not to bail out the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. While other companies that made similar mistakes received government backing, the Korean government, after many years of supporting the industry as a core national interest, decided it would no longer do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

With over 1.3 trillion Korean won ($1 billion USD) in charter fees owed, Hanjin Shipping could not negotiate a way out after entering court receivership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. The company declared bankruptcy, and its last ship was sold for demolition in March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

Eastman Kodak, for a long time, dominated the [[rise_and_fall_of_silverbased_photographic_film_industry | silver-based photographic film industry]] alongside Fujifilm, clashing for decades in global markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, as digital photography suddenly emerged, annihilating the old film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, Kodak failed to adapt and diversify, unlike its rival Fujifilm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Early Digital Awareness and Strategic Hesitation

Kodak was aware of the impending digital future, with both Kodak and Fujifilm long recognizing that digital imaging was the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. In fact, one of Kodak's employees, Steve Sasson, assembled the first digital camera in 1975 using components from various companies and a Kodak lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This early product, though large and producing poor imagery, led Kodak employees to predict that [[rise_and_fall_of_silverbased_photographic_film_industry | silver-based imaging products]] would be obsolete by the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Kodak scientists also produced high-quality image sensors, including a 1.4 million-pixel CCD sensor in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

However, these explorations of digital photography often only resulted in patents, failing to lead to new successful businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Kodak's leadership struggled to reconcile new digital ventures with their traditional film business, which was considered "one of the greatest business models ever discovered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. They never settled on a clear plan for Kodak in the digital era, hesitating to pursue opportunities that didn't fit their established model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

For instance, in 1976, Kodak developed the Ektaprint, a printer with a microprocessor that was simpler and more reliable than its rival at Xerox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Yet, they failed to aggressively pursue this market, unfamiliar with the business model of renting out heavy equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## Reversal of Diversification and Divestment

While Fujifilm pursued [[diversification_and_innovative_strategies_of_fujifilm | diversification into new business lines]] outside of photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, Kodak followed a different path. Although Kodak did try to shrink its film manufacturing business, cutting jobs and costs in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, it struggled to move beyond the core idea of selling film and providing photography services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

Former CEO Colby Chandler had attempted diversification, investing in areas like floppy disks, batteries, artificial snow, and pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. However, his successors, K. Whitmore and George Fisher, reversed this drive, choosing instead to double down on imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

A notable failure in Kodak's strategy was the divestment of potentially profitable ventures:
*   **Specialty Chemical Business**: In 1993, Kodak spun off its specialty chemical business, which had been formed in 1920 and generated 8% of Kodak's sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. Today, this spun-off entity, Eastman Chemical, is a $10 billion Fortune 500 company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
*   **Pharmaceutical/Healthcare Division**: Kodak also sold its Sterling Winthrop drug unit, which included its over-the-counter consumer drugs business (like Bayer Aspirin) and was generating over $1 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. While Kodak had begun researching and filing pharmaceutical and medical equipment patents around the same time as Fujifilm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>, it withdrew from these ventures in 1996, reaffirming its identity as an "Imaging company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

## Continued Struggles in Digital Ventures

In the early 2000s, Kodak continued to focus on digital imaging but struggled to find a sustainable business model:
*   **Digital Cameras**: In 2001, Kodak released the EasyShare digital camera, which sold well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. For a period between 2004-2005, Kodak even held a leading market share in the U.S. digital camera space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. However, like Fujifilm, Kodak quickly learned that selling digital cameras was a "terrible business" due to low barriers to entry and intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. Kodak's market share in this segment shriveled to 7% by 2010, and the company earned more from licensing its digital technology patents than from camera sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
*   **Inkjet Printers**: In 2005, Kodak entered the inkjet printer business, a move likely influenced by new CEO Antonio Perez, who came from Hewlett-Packard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. This foray proved disastrous, leading to net losses of $1.2 billion in 2005 and $691 million in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
*   **Final Divestment**: In 2007, Kodak sold its last valuable asset, its Healthcare division, which included radiology and medical printing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

Saddled with high debt and pension liabilities, Kodak struggled for five more years before ultimately filing for bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

## Conclusion

The fundamental [[key_differences_in_strategies_between_fujifilm_and_kodak_during_digital_transition | difference between Kodak and Fujifilm]] lay in their core identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. Kodak was primarily a consumer brand with a strong technology base, whereas Fujifilm began as a technology company that happened to sell to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. When their consumer film businesses vanished, Fujifilm found it easier to revert to its technological roots and diversify into new areas based on its chemical expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Kodak, however, remained fixated on imaging and photography, unable to pivot despite having the underlying chemical and manufacturing precision expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. This strategic rigidity led to Kodak's downfall, as it clung to a sinking ship, discarding potential life rafts along the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

Deng Xiaoping emerged as China's paramount leader in July 1977, holding the titles of Communist Party vice-chairman, Central Military Commission vice-chairman, and chief of the People’s Liberation Army General Staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. He consolidated power by seizing it from Hua Guofeng, who was Chairman Mao Zedong’s appointed successor, during a significant November 1976 meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. During this meeting, Chen Yun, an economic czar, Deng confidant, and one of the Eight Elders of the Communist Party, delivered a powerful speech highlighting the "sins of the extreme left" during the Cultural Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Deng mobilized forces to support Chen’s speech, leading to a shift away from Mao Zedong’s policies and the downfall of his allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Political and Economic Reorientation

With the ultra-left ideology wing no longer in control, a more moderate faction, led by Deng, rose to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This new leadership prioritized modernizing the economy and opening China to the outside world, which included warming relations with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

At this time, the Chinese Communist Party viewed the Soviet Union as its most significant foreign policy threat, a sentiment that had persisted since the Sino-Soviet Split, which began with disputes between Mao and Khrushchev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The continued presence of major Soviet military forces and live-ammunition exercises near the Soviet-Chinese borders prevented any trust from building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Decision to Invade Vietnam

Deng Xiaoping almost singlehandedly drove the war effort against Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. He reportedly harbored an "irrational" grudge against the Vietnamese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. As the paramount leader, there was no one in a position to question or oppose his decision to proceed with the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

The invasion served multiple political purposes:
*   **"Teaching a Lesson" to Vietnam** Deng's China believed Vietnam had become "too big for their britches" and deserved a lesson for their "insolence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This reinforced the long-standing Vietnamese perception that China would always treat them as a junior partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Signaling to the West** Invading Vietnam was intended to be seen by the global community as a serious indicator of China’s intentions to draw a line between the Communist Parties of China and Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Demonstrating Military Reliability** It would also prove that [[Military Strategies and Tactics of the PLA | China’s fighting forces]] could competently fight alongside the West to counter Soviet influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Military Strategy and Execution

For the incursion into Vietnam, Deng specifically instructed the army to limit the scope of the war to achieve China’s political goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This approach was designed to prevent China from getting bogged down, similar to America's experience in Vietnam, and to keep the Soviet Union from intervening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

The war was planned in two stages:
1.  A two-pronged offensive targeting Cao Bang, Lao Cai, and Dong Dang (February 17-25) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
2.  [[Military Strategies and Tactics of the PLA | PLA]] forces converging on Lang Son (February 26-March 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

Upon completion of these stages, the Chinese army was to withdraw and declare victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Some 330,000 [[Military Strategies and Tactics of the PLA | PLA]] men were allocated for the mostly land-based attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

Despite the [[Military Strategies and Tactics of the PLA | PLA]] assuming an overwhelming 8:1 advantage over the Vietnamese forces, this assessment ignored well-trained and equipped local militias, making the actual ratio closer to 2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

Deng and the Central Command imposed several restrictions that impacted military operations:
*   **Restricted Air Support** Chinese flying missions were restricted only to Chinese airspace, leaving ground troops without aerial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Centralized Command** Middle and lower-ranking officers were not allowed to make independent judgments or adjust to conditions, forcing the [[Military Strategies and Tactics of the PLA | PLA]] to use human wave attacks against fortifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Acceptance of Casualties** This resulted in immense casualties, though progress was made through "sheer force of numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Strategic Principles

While Deng’s political leadership differed from Mao’s, their military strategies shared similarities, particularly in the emphasis on annihilating enemy forces, usually through encirclement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. One general stated that central leadership instructed them to "use a butcher’s knife to kill a chick," meaning to employ sharp strikes to destroy vital enemy areas while avoiding their strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. However, when a strategic advantage was perceived, heavy losses were endured, with infantrymen pushed into close, massed combat even against fortified positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

## Conclusion and Aftermath

Beijing publicly announced that the war was limited in scope and aims, intended to keep Vietnam "in line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This strategy succeeded, as the Soviets ultimately did not intervene, considering the fighting "limited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. On March 5, Beijing declared victory, having advanced into Vietnam and captured key cities, and the [[Military Strategies and Tactics of the PLA | PLA]] began to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. The Communist Party adhered to its stated aim, preventing the conflict from escalating into a larger war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

Despite heavy [[Military Strategies and Tactics of the PLA | PLA]] casualties (estimates vary widely, from 6,900 to 42,000 killed or wounded) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>, Party officials acknowledged the [[Military Strategies and Tactics of the PLA | PLA]]'s underperformance on an operational basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Army planners had boasted they could take Hanoi in a week with a fraction of their forces, but it took 16 days and 10 full divisions to cover only a third of that distance, without facing the proper Vietnamese army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

The war revealed outdated weapons, tactics, and low morale within the [[Military Strategies and Tactics of the PLA | PLA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. The top-down command structure meant soldiers felt their lives were being wasted, with some units "forced" to advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

Ultimately, the Chinese Communist Party views war and the [[Military Strategies and Tactics of the PLA | PLA]] as tools to achieve political goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. If these political goals are met, the [[Military Strategies and Tactics of the PLA | PLA]] is deemed successful, regardless of military performance or the number of casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

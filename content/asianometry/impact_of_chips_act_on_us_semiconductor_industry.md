The [[government_subsidies_and_investments_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | CHIPS Act of 2022]] has set aside $50 billion in subsidies, leading to significant investments in new semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This legislation aims to bolster the US's position in the global semiconductor supply chain and encourage domestic production.

## Subsidies and Facility Build-outs
The CHIPS Act has catalyzed the construction of major fabrication plants (fabs) by leading semiconductor companies in the U.S.:
*   **Samsung:** Building a $17 billion plant in Taylor, Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Intel:** Constructing a $20 billion chip plant in Columbus, Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **TSMC:** While not directly stated as a recipient *from* the Chips Act funds, TSMC is investing an additional $28 billion over three years (into 2026) for a second Arizona factory equipped with N3 technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. TSMC is strategically positioned to accept these subsidies, which could mean less funding is available for competitors like Intel and Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Strategic Implications
The availability of these subsidies plays a role in the decisions of major players like TSMC. If Apple, a significant customer, desires to source from the U.S. and the economics align, TSMC will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. TSMC might consider accepting subsidies to prevent customers from turning to competitors like Samsung or Intel, which are also expanding their US manufacturing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Limitations and Gaps
Despite the significant investment from the CHIPS Act, the subsidies are not sufficient to achieve complete self-sufficiency for the U.S. in semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Key areas remain largely unaddressed:
*   **Conventional Packaging:** There is currently no U.S. government funding or plans for conventional packaging facilities, which are essential for many industrial semiconductors, including those used in cars, refrigerators, and airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The U.S. has a very low market share in global packaging, assembly, and test capacity (3% compared to 10% in fabrication) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Legacy Chips:** The Arizona Fab and other new U.S. facilities focus on advanced N3 and N4 chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, but the majority of industrially important semiconductors are older nodes (e.g., 130nm, 65nm, N28 chips) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Full Supply Chain:** The U.S. continues to rely heavily on Taiwan's leading positions in other parts of the chip supply chain, such as wafers, packaging, assembly, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Duplicating the entire global supply chain would be economically challenging, if not impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Expertise and Management:** The core management, R&D, operations, and supply chain management personnel for companies like TSMC remain primarily in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Decades of industrial development in Taiwan cannot be replicated quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

These factors indicate that while the CHIPS Act significantly boosts US domestic fabrication capacity, it does not achieve complete self-sufficiency or remove the reliance on the existing global semiconductor ecosystem, particularly Taiwan's integral role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. The [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_semiconductor_industry | China-Taiwan scenario]] remains a systemic risk that cannot be fully hedged against simply by investing in US-based fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

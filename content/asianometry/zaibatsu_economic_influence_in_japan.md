From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The zaibatsu of Japan effectively controlled the nation's economy for many decades, extending into the early 1900s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The families owning these vast businesses accumulated immense wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Their unchecked expansion allowed their industrial combines to become vast "mini-economies" within Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. However, this wealth and income inequality abruptly ended over a very short period, with these families losing control of their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Origins and Rise

The story of the zaibatsu begins with Matthew Perry and the Black Ships, which forced Japan's opening in the 1850s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This event exposed a massive East-West industrial gap and humiliated the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The ruling Tokugawa military government's attempts to modernize the military drained the treasury, leading to currency debasement and tax increases that angered the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

A group of samurai, concerned about Japan suffering the same fate as China, removed the shoguns from power in a movement known as the [[meiji_restoration_and_industrialization | Meiji Restoration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The new leaders instituted significant changes in the country's political, social, and economic structure, stripping privileges from the hereditary samurai class and converting their stipends into government bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Many educated samurai became professional business managers in this new era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

To rapidly industrialize and avoid Western colonization, the [[meiji_restoration_and_industrialization | Meiji government]] founded numerous state-owned enterprises (SOEs) across various sectors, including railways, breweries, cement, textiles, shipbuilding, and weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. These SOEs aimed to build industrial capacity to replace imports and were not initially expected to be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Their losses were covered by nationalizing Japan's mines, declaring all underground minerals state property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

By the late 1870s, SOE losses threatened to bankrupt the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. In the early 1880s, the government attempted to transfer these assets to private hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. An initial privatization round in 1880 failed to sell money-losing SOEs at book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Four years later, profitable SOEs, including mines, were offered to the highest bidder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Mines, specifically, held the most opportunity, as foreign experts helped revitalize their output through steam power pumps, explosives, and vertical shafts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

Out of 21 major privatization sales, 11 involved mining, including the prized Mikay coal mine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This injection of foreign technology unlocked significant value but resulted in a massive transfer of public assets to private hands, comparable to the creation of Russian oligarchs in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. The merchant families who acquired and benefited from these assets went on to create the zaibatsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The term "zaibatsu" literally means "financial clan" in Chinese characters, sharing origins with the Korean word for [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | chaebol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:05:03]</a>.

## Structure and Influence

While merchant trading houses existed before the [[meiji_restoration_and_industrialization | Meiji Restoration]], they were not structured like Western businesses and held low social status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The turbulent [[meiji_restoration_and_industrialization | Meiji era]] presented unique opportunities for families with the right connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Top-tier zaibatsu like Mitsubishi and Sumitomo date back to the shogun era, while "second-tier" zaibatsu like Nissan, Furukawa, and Kawasaki emerged after the Russo-Japanese War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Common characteristics among these groups include:
*   An extended family controlling a holding company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   Holding companies controlling numerous subsidiary businesses run by non-familial professional managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   Zaibatsu assets being communal family property, not to be used by any single member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:06:01]</a>.

Their path to plutocracy was similar: acquiring exclusive rights to or purchasing vast natural resources, then using profits from these "cash cows" to fund expansion into other areas of the Japanese economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:14]</a>.

Mitsui family serves as a prime example:
*   They were already wealthy by the 1840s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   In 1867, they switched allegiance from the shogunate to the new [[meiji_restoration_and_industrialization | Meiji government]], helping raise funds for its armies and assisting in currency reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   Their success led to lucrative concessions for government financial services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Their financial resources enabled them to acquire several mines, including the Mikay coal mine, forming the foundation of their wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   Mitsui then established businesses like Mitsui Bank, Mitsui Mining, and Mitsui Bussan (a general trading company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   Mitsui expanded its operations, becoming a mini-economy, for instance, funneling mining profits to establish Mitsui Chemicals to supply dyes for its textile businesses, and creating a shipbuilding subsidiary for its trading company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:36]</a>.

Without government checks on their growth, these corporations dominated the domestic economy, akin to a [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | Samsung]] before Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:47]</a>.

In the 1920s, as natural resource "cash cows" declined, zaibatsu families sought new capital through the stock market, selling minority stakes in subsidiaries to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:08:02]</a>. Shareholders, however, never held enough shares to exert real control, as families retained controlling blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:10]</a>. This unlocked capital for families to acquire more assets like farmland and residential complexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:22]</a>. Rents and high-yielding financial assets generated immense passive income for the rich, burdening the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:31]</a>. The wealth of the top 1% grew 3.5 times faster than the national average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:36]</a>.

The government tolerated this wealth inequality because the zaibatsu aided the country's industrial push and later its militarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:54]</a>. Throughout the early 20th century, Japan embarked on expansionist drives, including the creation of Manchukuo, the colonization of Korea, and the invasion of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:09:15]</a>. The zaibatsu provided raw goods and materials for this militarist push, reaping massive government contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Decline and Dissolution

In the 1930s, a military government came to power in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:29]</a>. This new government criticized the zaibatsu for their "short-term focus on profits" and passed laws that de facto took control of their investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:47]</a>. On the eve of Japan's entry into World War II, the families lost control of their companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:58]</a>.

Starting the Second Sino-Japanese War and then aggressively pursuing [[impact_of_world_war_ii_on_japanese_economy | World War II]] brought misfortune to the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:09]</a>. To maintain social stability and control, the Japanese government enacted substantial and radical reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:19]</a>. Throughout this period, zaibatsu families saw their wealth drastically reduced:
*   War damage crippled their most productive assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   The government regulated rents, wages, and land prices, further reducing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   Intervention in financial markets to sell war bonds reduced returns on family financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   Starting in 1938, the government confiscated and redistributed agricultural land from landlords to tenant farmers to stimulate food production, effectively acting as accidental land reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:58]</a>. These land reform policies continued after the war, carried on by occupation authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:11:04]</a>.

After the war, in 1946, the government instituted a tax on capital to pay off its debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:10]</a>. Zaibatsu families' taxable assets were taxed at an 85% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:16]</a>. For example, Sumitomo Kuchizaymo, head of the Sumitomo zaibatsu, lost 89% of his taxable assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:24]</a>.

Despite this, significant stocks were still held by zaibatsu holding companies themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:33]</a>. Concerns about the sprawling nature of these companies led trust-busting economists, recalling the American Great Depression, to order the zaibatsu's dissolution in September 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:47]</a>. Ten zaibatsu families were targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:49]</a>.

On October 8, 1946, commissioners from the Holding Company Liquidation Commission (HCLC) seized 1.25 billion yen worth of stocks and bonds from Mitsui and Mitsubishi offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:12:10]</a>. The other "big four" zaibatsu, Yasuda and Sumitomo, faced similar actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:18]</a>. In early 1947, the HCLC ordered top family executives and their associates to resign from their positions, removing nearly 2,000 executives and several hundred businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:30]</a>. A second purge in January 1948 identified 56 family heads, removed 309 relatives from company positions, and forced 2,798 additional high-ranking executives to resign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:13:01]</a>. The HCLC also acquired personally held stocks and bonds worth another 1.2 billion yen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:09]</a>.

While the American public believed the zaibatsu shared responsibility for Japanese aggression, the HCLC's primary goal was to dissolve the "powerful octopus of monopolistic financial industrial and commercial combines" rather than to punish individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:42]</a>. Despite the dramatic actions, the zaibatsu families emerged "relatively alright," as the commission and occupation treated them fairly, avoiding a communist-style takeover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:57]</a>. They received cash compensation for acquired financial assets, for instance, the Mitsui families received 1.2 billion yen for their shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:28]</a>.

However, proceeds were deposited into a national bank, and withdrawals were limited until 1951 to prevent families from re-acquiring controlling stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:37]</a>. A significant side effect was the broad democratization of Japanese stocks; in 1946, zaibatsu owned one out of every four stocks, but by 1950, this fell to one out of 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:52]</a>.

Ultimately, the zaibatsu families' wealth and income were drastically reduced due to:
*   Land reform during and after the war eliminating their rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   The postwar tax on capital siphoning away four-fifths of their taxable family assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:11]</a>.
*   Forced sales of some art to museums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:14]</a>.
*   Most significantly, hyperinflation: as their cash holdings were locked until 1951, triple-digit annual inflation caused the real value of their funds to plummet by 97% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:29]</a>.

By 1950, the top 1% highest-earning Japanese derived half of their income from employment, indicating that the former plutocrats no longer had comfortable, plutocratic wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:50]</a>.

## Post-Dissolution Legacy

While family plutocrats and their associates were removed from their companies, the occupation stopped short of a total dismemberment of the companies themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:16:04]</a>. The truly significant outcome was the government bureaucracy, specifically the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), gaining de facto policy and guidance control over Japan's massive corporate apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:24]</a>. This had long-term effects comparable to leveling out wealth inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:28]</a>.

Previously, zaibatsu families ran their company "fiefdoms" to grow their own wealth, focusing on dominating the domestic market, suppressing competition, reaping monopoly profits, and avoiding risky export markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:43]</a>. The "reset" allowed MITI to steer Japanese companies onto a new, pro-export industrialist path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:57]</a>. Instead of carving up the domestic economy, Japan's companies, now filled with professional managers, focused outwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:17:06]</a>. They pioneered the "catch-up strategy" later emulated by other East Asian Tigers: acquiring and mastering foreign technology to create products for the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:23]</a>. This export discipline contributed to the [[postwar_economic_reforms_and_japanese_export_growth | Japanese economic miracle]] of the 1950s and 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:32]</a>.

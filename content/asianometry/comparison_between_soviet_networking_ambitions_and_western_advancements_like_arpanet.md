In the 1960s, as the Soviet economy faced stagnation and a desperate need for reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02"></a>, a radical idea emerged: a single, nationwide computer network that would autonomously gather and process data from all the country's factories and command them to produce as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10"></a>. This proposed "Soviet internet" was envisioned as the "nervous system for an entire nation," aiming to usher in a new, tech-led future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18"></a>. However, this vision, known as [[ogas_and_the_vision_of_a_soviet_internet | OGAS]], never materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25"></a>.

## The Soviet Command Economy and its Challenges

For much of its existence, the Soviet Union operated a command economy where the state owned everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20"></a>. Economic activity was coordinated through directives, quotas, and commands, rather than market processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33"></a>. Three key state entities were involved:
*   **Gosplan (State Planning Commission)**: Responsible for drafting five-year plans and defining economic inputs, including prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51"></a>.
*   **Gossnab (State Commission for Materials and Equipment Supplier)**: Implemented Gosplan's plans by procuring and supplying producer goods to factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00"></a>.
*   **Gosbank**: Handled accounting and recorded transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44"></a>.

While the command economy initially achieved rapid growth and notable technological and social advancements, particularly in military and aerospace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11"></a>, the central planning system frequently struggled. It suffered from immense paperwork, distorted incentives, and frequent miscommunications in assigning quotas and redistributing outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22"></a>. Many quotas, especially outside the military, were only met through a network of "pushers"—fixer-type individuals who operated informally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40"></a>. Attempts at reform often exacerbated the bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54"></a>.

## The Dawn of Soviet Cybernetics

Following Stalin's death in 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00"></a>, Nikita Khrushchev's leadership (1953-1964) brought a series of reforms, including the normalization and adoption of cybernetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12"></a>. At the 20th Congress of the Communist Party in 1956, Khrushchev praised cybernetics as a "major tool of the creation of a communist Society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23"></a>.

Cybernetics, originated by Norbert Wiener in the United States, had been banned under Stalin due to its assertions about information as a substance and its analogies between brain neurons and electric signals in computers, which conflicted with established Russian psychological theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48"></a>. Khrushchev's reversal allowed cybernetics to flourish, evolving into a project to introduce mathematical methods to life and social sciences, imbuing it with an "aura of truth and objectivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09"></a>. The Soviets, much like East Germany with semiconductors, fell under a "technological spell," believing computers could unlock a universal method of problem-solving for their ailing economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37"></a>.

## Western Computing Influence and Soviet Military Networks

In 1958, news of the American Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system reached the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50"></a>. SAGE was a groundbreaking air defense system that coordinated raw radar data from multiple sites to create a unified image of America's airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59"></a>. Developed after the Soviets detonated their first atomic bomb, SAGE was powered by the largest computer ever built at the time, costing $8 billion—more than the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10"></a>.

SAGE's classified capabilities greatly alarmed Soviet military planners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31"></a>. In response, the Soviets tasked three institutes with independently building three centralized computer networks for air defense (System A), missile defense, and space surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37"></a>. System A, which Khrushchev famously boasted could "hit a fly in outer space" in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50"></a>, connected two Soviet supercomputers (M40 and M50) built in 1958 and 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59"></a>. This military effort revealed the potential of networked computers for civilian use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07"></a>.

## Early Proposals for a Soviet Internet

Anatoli Kitov, an early pioneer in Soviet cybernetics, proposed the first effort to network the nation in 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16"></a>. A war hero and rocket scientist, Kitov embraced Norbert Wiener's work, concluding cybernetics was a valuable tool for the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34"></a>. He authored "The Main Features of Cybernetics," the Soviet Union's first significant positive article on the subject approved for wide publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48"></a>.

In 1956, Kitov wrote a book on how computers could model and regulate the Soviet economy, suggesting they could replace existing tabulating machines for economic data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04"></a>. In January 1959, he wrote to the Communist Party Central Committee, urging the adoption of computers for economic planning and proposing the "Unified State Network of Computing Centers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20"></a>. This initial proposal gained support, leading to a resolution to speed up computer production and application in the national economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57"></a>.

Buoyed by this success, Kitov expanded his vision in late 1959, proposing the installation of large computers at local factories and government agencies, linked together as "Automated Systems of Management" (ASUS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10"></a>. His ultimate dream was a "unified automated management system" for the entire nation, military and civilian, called the "Economic Automatic Management System" (EASU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33"></a>. This system would use powerful, underground military computers accessible via terminals for data submission and processing, maximizing the command economy's centralization and creating immense financial savings by replacing bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51"></a>.

However, Kitov's letter also criticized the Ministry of Defense's slow computer adoption and suggested sharing military technology with civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20"></a>. This "red letter" never reached Khrushchev but angered the military, who did not want to share their technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31"></a>. Kitov subsequently lost his job, party membership, and military honors, effectively being "canceled" but not executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55"></a>. He continued to advocate for a networked Soviet future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09"></a>.

## The Rise of OGAS

Despite Kitov's setback, others continued to develop networking concepts. In the West, time-sharing services (like GE's) and private networks (like American Airlines and IBM's SABRE for reservations) emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21"></a>. In 1962, Soviet cyberneticist Alexander Kharkevich proposed a national unified communications network akin to a "railway network for storing and sending messages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37"></a>.

Victor Glushkov, head of the Kiev Institute of Cybernetics, became a prominent figure, seeking to implement Kitov's ASUS concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51"></a>. Glushkov even hired Kitov as a consultant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05"></a>. In late 1962, Glushkov wrote to Khrushchev, highlighting the growing [[soviet_versus_western_computing_capabilities | technology gap with the West]] and advocating for accelerated Soviet computerization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11"></a>. This concern led to approval in 1963 for research into economic reform using automated computer networks (ASUS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23"></a>. ASUS allowed mainframe computers to receive factory industrial process information, resembling local network factory automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34"></a>.

Glushkov's team studied factory information processing throughout the early 1960s, with successes like a Kiev computer system controlling a steel smelting factory 300 miles away and a carbonization process 400 miles away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46"></a>. But Glushkov aimed for more, leading to [[ogas_and_the_vision_of_a_soviet_internet | OGAS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16"></a>.

### The Vision of OGAS

[[ogas_and_the_vision_of_a_soviet_internet | OGAS]] is an abbreviation for "All-State Automated System for the Management of the Economy," standing for "All-State Automated System for the Gathering and Processing of Information for the Accounting, Planning, and Governance of the National Economy USSR" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24"></a>.

As originally conceived in the early 1960s, [[ogas_and_the_vision_of_a_soviet_internet | OGAS]] was ambitious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43"></a>. It featured a three-tiered hierarchy:
1.  **First Tier**: 20,000 computer terminals and ASUS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51"></a>.
2.  **Second Tier**: 100-200 mid-level regional planning decision systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55"></a>.
3.  **Third Tier**: Rolled up to a central planner in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01"></a>.

Glushkov even proposed computerizing currency and money flows, initially including a moneyless system of receipts to appeal to Khrushchev's Marxist ideals, though this idea was later dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06"></a>.

The vision driving [[ogas_and_the_vision_of_a_soviet_internet | OGAS]] was a single computer network that would rationally and automatically plan, optimize, and produce the country's national economy as dictated by the Party Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39"></a>. Each bureaucrat's workdays would be planned, with computers generating detailed lists of duties, timetables, responsibilities, and document arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51"></a>. This system was likened to a "nervous system" for the Soviet Union, connecting the "brain" (leadership) to the "body" (factories and workers) to ensure coordinated output and eliminate bureaucratic inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06"></a>. It was intended as the Soviet counterpoint to the Western capitalist view of a self-regulating market economy, using historical data for rational forecasts and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34"></a>.

### Why OGAS Failed

The original vision of [[ogas_and_the_vision_of_a_soviet_internet | OGAS]], first presented in 1964, never developed as planned for several reasons:
1.  **Cost**: The proposed system, with its thousands of computer centers, would have taken 30 years to build and cost an estimated 160 billion rubles, or about $1.4 trillion USD in 2016 dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48"></a>. This was more than both the [[comparison_of_soviet_and_american_space_programs | Soviet space]] and [[comparisons_between_soviet_and_american_nuclear_weapons_development | atomic bomb programs]] combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16"></a>.
2.  **Technological Readiness**: While Soviet military computers had world-leading capabilities for network coverage and messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24"></a>, [[soviet_versus_western_computing_capabilities | civilian computer technology lagged significantly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33"></a>. The military was unwilling to transfer its specialized technology to civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39"></a>.
3.  **Bureaucratic Resistance**: Various players objected to the idea of being replaced or dictated to by a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50"></a>. This included Communist Party bureaucrats, Gosplan officials, and industrial managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59"></a>. The Central Statistical Administration, in particular, recognized that the "objective collection of data" by computers would curb their power to control information flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05"></a>.
4.  **All-or-Nothing Approach**: Glushkov's plans were an "all or nothing" proposal, requiring a complete reformation of the country's management system—a revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18"></a>.

## Evolution and Final Demise of OGAS

In 1964, Khrushchev lost power and was replaced by Leonid Brezhnev, who reversed many of his predecessor's economic reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32"></a>. However, the directive for economic restructuring via computer remained on the agenda due to high-level backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46"></a>. Gosplan and the Central Statistical Administration rejected [[ogas_and_the_vision_of_a_soviet_internet | OGAS]]'s utopian vision, instead vying to control its resources for their own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56"></a>. For [[ogas_and_the_vision_of_a_soviet_internet | OGAS]] to be implemented, it had to conform to the existing Soviet system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09"></a>.

### The ARPANET Catalyst

In 1969, widespread news of ARPANET, the predecessor to today's internet, caught the Soviet leadership by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23"></a>. This competitive factor helped push the [[ogas_and_the_vision_of_a_soviet_internet | OGAS]] project forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33"></a>. With ARPANET in mind, Glushkov modified [[ogas_and_the_vision_of_a_soviet_internet | OGAS]]'s purpose: it would become a universal information bank, accumulating and moving data between national agencies, rather than controlling the entire economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41"></a>. This new [[ogas_and_the_vision_of_a_soviet_internet | OGAS]] was envisioned as a "system of canals controlling the flow of water" between data reservoirs, making the Soviet Union more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01"></a>.

At a momentous meeting on October 1, 1970, Glushkov presented his revised [[ogas_and_the_vision_of_a_soviet_internet | OGAS]] to the Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11"></a>. For a brief moment, a Soviet internet seemed possible, with several high-ranking officials speaking positively and hardliners remaining silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19"></a>. However, Minister of Finance Vasili Garbuzov, recognizing the project's immense political gravity and potential to erode his ministry's power, dismissed [[ogas_and_the_vision_of_a_soviet_internet | OGAS]] as "silly" and proposed a far more conservative counter-proposal, which won over the Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41"></a>. The full [[ogas_and_the_vision_of_a_soviet_internet | OGAS]] proposal was neither fully accepted nor rejected, leading to its "worst type of existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04"></a>.

Throughout the 1970s, some individual ASUS systems were built in factories (sources vary from a hundred between 1971-1985 to thousands) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13"></a>. However, these were built haphazardly and without standardization, making a nationwide unified network of ASUS as Glushkov envisioned impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30"></a>.

The proximate cause of the Soviet internet's failure was [[challenges_and_bureaucratic_infighting_in_implementing_soviet_internet | bureaucratic infighting]], with various power centers hijacking the project for their own needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43"></a>. The deeper reason was that Glushkov's Soviet internet challenged the fundamental way the Soviet Union operated, and an invention cannot be separated from its context—a nation just decades away from implosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55"></a>.

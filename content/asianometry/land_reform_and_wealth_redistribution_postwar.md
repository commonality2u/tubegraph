Before World War II, the Zaibatsu of Japan, which were massive industrial combines, effectively managed the nation's economy [00:00:01]. The families owning these "titanic businesses" accumulated "plutocratic amounts of wealth" [00:00:07]. This unchecked expansionism allowed their combines to become vast "mini economies" within Japan [00:00:14]. However, over a very short period, this significant wealth and income inequality abruptly ceased, as these families lost control of their companies [00:00:21].

## Pre-War and Wartime Context

The Japanese government, throughout the early 20th century, embarked on expansionist drives, pushed by militarist ideology [00:08:57]. The Zaibatsu helped supply the raw goods and materials for this militarist push, gaining substantial government contracts [00:09:15].

In the 1930s, a military government came to power in Japan [00:09:27]. This new government criticized the Zaibatsu for their "short-term focus on profits" and enacted laws that de facto took control of their investment decisions [00:09:40]. By the eve of Japan's entry into World War II, the Zaibatsu families had lost control of their companies [00:09:54].

To maintain social stability and power during World War II, the Japanese government implemented "substantial and radical reforms" [00:10:11]. During this period, Zaibatsu family wealth was significantly reduced [00:10:20]:
*   War damage crippled the most productive assets of their companies [00:10:24].
*   The government regulated rents, wages, and land prices for its workers, further reducing profits [00:10:28].
*   Intervention in financial markets to sell more war bonds decreased returns on the families' financial assets [00:10:33].

Notably, starting in 1938, the government began confiscating and redistributing agricultural land from landlords to tenant farmers [00:10:42]. This policy aimed to stimulate food production for the war effort but also resulted in accidental land reform [00:10:51].

## Postwar Reforms and Redistribution

The land reform policies initiated during the war continued after Japan's surrender, carried on by the occupation authorities [00:10:58].

In 1946, following the war's conclusion, the government instituted a "tax on capital" to pay off its debt [00:11:05]. Zaibatsu families had their taxable family assets taxed at an 85 percent rate [00:11:10]. For example, Sumitomo Kuchizaymo, the head of the Sumitomo Zaibatsu, lost 89% of his taxable assets [00:11:18].

### Zaibatsu Dissolution

Despite the capital tax, a significant amount of stock remained under the control of the Zaibatsu holding companies [00:11:26]. Due to concerns about the sprawling nature of these companies, trust-busting economists, recalling the American Great Depression, ordered the Zaibatsu to be dissolved in September 1946 [00:11:33].

Ten Zaibatsu families were targeted [00:11:47]. On October 8, 1946, the Holding Company Liquidation Commission (HCLC) seized 1.25 billion yen worth of stocks and bonds belonging to the Mitsui and Mitsubishi holding companies [00:11:54]. The other "big four" Zaibatsu—Yasuda and Sumitomo—underwent similar actions [00:12:13].

In early 1947, the HCLC ordered top family executives and their associates to resign from their company positions, removing nearly 2,000 executives and several hundred businesses [00:12:20]. A second purge in January 1948 identified 56 family heads, removed 309 of their relatives from company positions, and forced 2,798 additional high-ranking executives to resign [00:12:41]. The HCLC also acquired these individuals' personally held stocks and bonds, valued at another 1.2 billion yen in 1948 [00:13:02]. Half of this was paid to the government as part of the tax on capital, with the rest going to the HCLC for future resale [00:13:12].

### Impact on Wealth and Society

The Zaibatsu families received cash compensation for the financial assets acquired by the HCLC, with Mitsui families, for instance, receiving 1.2 billion yen for their shares [00:14:17]. However, these proceeds were deposited into a national bank, and withdrawals were restricted until 1951 to prevent the re-acquisition of controlling stakes [00:14:29].

This action resulted in the "broad democratization of Japanese stocks" [00:14:41]. In 1946, Zaibatsu owned one out of every four stocks, but by 1950, this proportion had dropped to one out of 20 [00:14:46].

The most significant factor in the drastic reduction of wealth for Japan's richest families was hyperinflation [00:15:16]. Triple-digit annual inflation in the years leading up to 1951 caused the real value of their cash holdings to plummet by 97% [00:15:24].

By 1950, the wealth of Japan's richest families was "more than comfortable but no longer plutocratic" [00:15:33]. The top 1% highest-earning Japanese derived half of their income from employment, indicating a significant shift from passive income [00:15:40].

## Economic Transformation

The ruling occupation stopped short of a total dismemberment of the companies themselves [00:16:00]. Instead, the government bureaucracy, specifically the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), gained de facto policy and guidance control over Japan's massive corporate apparatus [00:16:12].

This had profound long-term effects, nearly as significant as leveling out the country's wealth inequalities [00:16:27]. Previously, families ran their corporate fiefdoms to grow their own wealth, dominating the domestic market, suppressing competition, and avoiding risky ventures like the export market [00:16:31]. The postwar reset, however, allowed MITI to push Japanese companies onto a new, pro-export industrialist path [00:16:51].

Rather than carving up the domestic economy, Japanese companies, now staffed by a new generation of professional managers, focused outwards [00:16:59]. They pioneered a "catch-up strategy" by acquiring and mastering foreign technology to create products for global demand [00:17:08]. This "export discipline" was a key factor in creating the [[postwar_economic_reforms_and_japanese_export_growth | Japanese economic miracle]] of the 1950s and 1960s [00:17:25].

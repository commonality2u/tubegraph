The presence of [[semiconductor_industrys_counterfeit_chip_problem | counterfeit chips]] poses a significant risk, particularly in critical applications such as military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. For instance, an F-16 ejection seat malfunction leading to a pilot's death was linked to counterfeit microchips in its sequencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The U.S. government places the responsibility of detecting and filtering out these fake chips on contractors, with penalties for non-compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

A counterfeit semiconductor can be defined in several ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>:
*   A previously used electronic part sold as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   An unauthorized copy of an authentic electronic product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   An unauthorized copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   Does not conform to the original manufacturer's design, model, or performance standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Not produced by the original manufacturer or its authorized contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   Off-specification, already used, defective, or misleadingly labeled as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Incorrectly marked or with wrong documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Many fake chips enter products because contractors lack documented supply chain history or fail to conduct thorough inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Types of Counterfeit Chips and What to Look For

Understanding how counterfeit chips are produced is crucial for effective detection.

### Recycled/Remarked Chips
This category accounts for about 80% of total counterfeiting incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Recycling Process**: Scrap electronics are processed by heating circuit boards to melt solder, bashing them to loosen components, and then removing original markings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. New coatings and markings are applied to make them appear new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. These components are often old, worn out, and further damaged by the harvesting process, leading to non-functional parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Relabeled/Remarked Chips**: Markings on chips, which provide information about model, origin, and certifications, are altered to mislead users about the chip's capabilities and quality <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This can involve wiping away existing markings and adding new ones to make them appear more premium or expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. For example, commercial parts might be swapped in for more expensive military-grade components that require hardening against radiation or temperature damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Unauthorized Overproduction by Foundries
Sometimes, a foundry may produce more chips than contracted to, either for yield reasons or to resell them as counterfeits. This allows the foundry to profit from a valuable design without investing in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Unauthorized Clones
Third parties may clone chips to avoid expensive R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Reverse Engineering**: Designs can be obtained by physically analyzing the chip's layers, though this is difficult for complex chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Illegal Acquisition of IP**: Chip design intellectual property (IP) can be copied at various stages of the design and manufacturing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **Detection Difficulty**: Cloned chips are harder to detect because they are often functionally similar to the real thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. However, deviations in technology and process can lead to erratic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Inspection Methods

There are two primary categories of methods for inspecting potentially counterfeit chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>:

### Physical Methods
These methods look for defects related to the chip's physical properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **External Visual Inspection (EVI)**: Checks for defects in the chip's exterior, shipping, packaging, connections, IC packaging, bonding wires, or die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Invasive Methods**: Include X-ray inspection or even de-lidding the chip to expose its internal components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. These methods can be destructive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Electrical Methods
These tests check for changes in the chip's component parameters or whether the chip is functioning properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **Parametric Test**: Tests component parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Functional Test**: Tests if the chip operates correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness and Cost**: These tests are generally effective but can be time-consuming and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

### Challenges and Best Practices
Detecting counterfeits is nuanced; for instance, distinguishing normal physical defects from signs of sanding procedures to remove previous markings can be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. A balance must be struck between detection thoroughness and financial/time concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Best practices involve designing a set of tests that provide high confidence of coverage rather than total assurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## [[anticounterfeiting_measures_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Anti-Counterfeiting Design Measures]]
With the prevalence of recycled and remarked chips, "fabless" designers can incorporate features into their chip designs to aid detection, known as designed for counterfeit measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

*   **Unique ID**: A simple measure is to program a unique, readable ID into a non-programmable memory on the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Physical Unclonable Feature (PUF)**: This method creates a unique "fingerprint" for the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. One example uses random variables during fabrication to produce an "Arbiter PUF" circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. When a signal (challenge) is sent through it, it produces a random but repeatable output (response), similar to a two-step authentication app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Limitations**: Counterfeiters can still tamper with these methods, or they might be too difficult or costly to implement due to technical reasons or lack of space on the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Blockchain proposals leveraging PUFs for supply chain traceability require broad acceptance and collaboration among various players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

Ultimately, most counterfeit chips, particularly recycled ones, enter the supply chain due to opportunity and incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The low cost of harvesting old chips from e-waste (as low as 10 cents per chip) compared to their resale value ($1 to $10 or even $500 per chip) creates a significant profit margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This, combined with massive imports of improperly managed e-waste, contributes to the [[impact_of_recycled_and_fake_chips_on_global_trade | counterfeit chip problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

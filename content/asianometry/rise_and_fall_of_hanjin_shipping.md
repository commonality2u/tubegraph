In 2016, Hanjin Shipping, formerly South Korea's largest container shipping line, abruptly filed for reorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Once considered the country's pride and a worthy sibling to Korean Air, its unexpected insolvency caused global chaos in the [[Container shipping industrys global significance | shipping industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. At its peak in 2016, Hanjin was the fourth-biggest container line globally, operating 97 ships and calling on 90 different ports in over 35 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, the company encountered significant difficulties after the [[Impact of the global financial crisis on shipping | global financial crisis]], leading to a crash in freight rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Wikipedia's brief description of the incident is noted as "hilariously terse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Founding and Early Years

Hanjin Shipping was established as a branch of the Hanjin Group, one of South Korea's large "chaebol" business groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The Hanjin Group was founded in 1945 by Cho Choong-hoon with a few trucks, initially performing jobs for the U.S. Army, trucking military supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Cho Choong-hoon's companies consistently focused on transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

After the Korean War, Cho needed to expand his business to meet new demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Recognizing transportation as a risky business requiring capital, he turned to the national government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. President Park Chung-hee's economic growth plan offered generous loans from state banks to loyal companies that participated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The Hanjin Group profited handsomely from this cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Evolution of the Shipping Industry

The 1960s saw the United States enter the Vietnam War, which required immense logistical efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This period was beneficial for American shipping company Sealand Service, whose founder, Malcolm McLean, invented the practice of packing goods into standardized containers, simplifying shipping across various transportation modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. It was in Vietnam in 1966 that Cho Choong-hoon first observed the future of marine shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. A decade later, in 1977, Cho founded Hanjin Shipping alongside Korean Air, which had been acquired in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Hanjin Shipping was intended to be the business group's "Crown Jewel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Global Significance of Maritime Shipping

Maritime shipping is the backbone of globalization, transporting approximately 80% of the world's trade by volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Without it, international trade would be impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The seaborn transportation industry has three main categories:
*   **Bulk carriers**: Ship unpackaged goods like coal or grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Tankers**: Carry liquids or gases such as oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Container shipping**: Though smaller by total capacity, containers carry more valuable goods, making the industry highly competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### [[South Koreas economic strategies for shipping industry | South Korea's Economic Strategies for Shipping Industry]]

In 1972, South Korea possessed only three container vessels, with most container trade handled by foreign liners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The Korean government decided to develop its indigenous container capacity, implementing policies that encouraged the first generation of containerized shipping lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Within four years, the country had 36 ships and five shipping lines offering international container services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Despite this growth, 90% of Korean container exports and imports still relied on foreign carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

In 1976, the Korean government began explicitly subsidizing Korean container carriers, providing up to $1 million USD per year (in 1976 dollars) to each carrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. They also established the Korea Maritime and Port Administration to guide the industry's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Hanjin Shipping emerged at an opportune moment to leverage this national policy push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, rapidly buying new ships to expand its container service lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. In 1978, Hanjin offered its first Middle East service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, and in 1979, it partnered with Sealand for a low-cost, high-value service across the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Industry Volatility and Growth

The shipping industry is characterized by significant "whiplash issues" due to its volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Demand is tied to macroeconomic factors, seasonality, and sudden shocks, while supply is far less adjustable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Options for adjusting capacity—acquiring competitors, commissioning new ships (which takes years and millions of dollars), or chartering vessels—all present challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Misjudging market share and risk can be disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

In 1979, the shipping industry was hit by the oil crisis and subsequent macroeconomic slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The Korean government consolidated its shipping lines from 70 to 20 and provided aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. While Hanjin Shipping didn't receive a public bailout, its sister company, Korean Air, had to temporarily intervene in 1986 to help the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Hanjin quickly recovered and became profitable again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

The late 1980s and early 1990s witnessed a massive Korean export boom, with South Korean international trade tripling in volume from 1987 to 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. The Korean shipping industry benefited by positioning itself as a low-cost alternative to Western lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. During this period, the Korean government carefully managed the industry, restricting companies to specific routes and limiting new domestic market entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Hanjin and Korea Marine Transport Corporation were assigned lucrative Korea-to-US West Coast lanes, while Hyundai was restricted to routes to Japan and Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

Between 1986 and 1990, Hanjin more than doubled its carrying capacity from 24,856 TEU (20-foot equivalent units) to 53,140 TEU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This growth was achieved organically and through mergers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. In 1988, Hanjin acquired the struggling Korea Shipping Corporation, becoming the 13th largest container shipping line globally and the largest in South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. In 1997, it acquired DSR Senator, Germany's second-largest carrier, making Hanjin the fourth largest shipping line in the world, behind only Sealand, Maersk, and Evergreen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Decline and Dissolution

The peak conditions that created the Hanjin Shipping monolith ended with the Asian financial crisis in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. South Korea, being one of the worst affected, required a financial bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The IMF bailout came with strings attached, mandating policy changes in line with neoliberal governance beliefs of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

First, the Korean government was compelled to liberalize its shipping business, opening the market to foreign players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This exposed Korean shippers to the open market much faster than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Second, the IMF mandated that all Korean business conglomerates reduce their debt-to-equity ratios to below 200% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This forced Hanjin Shipping, along with many other Korean lines, to sell off ships to pay down debt and charter new ones to fill capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Hanjin had to sell and then lease back 29 of its ships, improving its debt-equity ratio but significantly increasing operating costs due to higher short-term prices charged by banks and third parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This combination of higher operating costs and new foreign competition led to a long-term decline in Korea's indigenous shipping lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

### Succession and Family Divisions

In 2002, Hanjin founder Cho Choong-hoon died at age 82 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. While publicly lauded as a great industrialist, he was also under investigation for massive tax evasion and fraud dating back to the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. His five children, including four sons, divided the empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. The eldest son, Cho Yang-ho, became Hanjin Group chairman, retaining Korean Air and what remained of the main company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Son Cho Su-ho received Hanjin Shipping, and other brothers received the shipbuilding, securities, and insurance divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This split meant Hanjin Shipping could no longer rely on its siblings for support during hardships, unlike the "undeclared bailout" by Korean Air in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### [[Impact of the global financial crisis on shipping | Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on Shipping]]

A new recovery in 2007-2008 led Hanjin to invest in future growth, ordering new mega-ships, following leaders like Maersk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. However, they ordered at the "exact wrong time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. By November 2008, two months after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, Hanjin had committed to orders for nearly a quarter million TEU worth of ships, a 40% increase in their fleet size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

The "Titanic economic slowdown" following the [[Impact of the global financial crisis on shipping | global financial crisis of 2008]] caused a severe shipping overcapacity crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Trade between the United States and Asia declined by 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Market leaders like Maersk and CMA CGM reported significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. As it takes years to work off an oversupply cycle, Hanjin's losses continued, and debt soared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

Hanjin's debt rose from approximately 195 billion Korean Won ($165 million USD) in 2012 to 440 billion Won ($375 million USD) by 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. To manage this, Hanjin began selling off its most profitable assets, including domestic and overseas terminals, liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker divisions, and its bulk shipping division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Eventually, only the volatile container shipping line remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

### Government Refusal for Bailout

Korea Development Bank (KDB), Hanjin's largest creditor, demanded 700 billion Won ($615 million USD) in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Hanjin could only raise 500 billion Won ($440 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. A government bailout was the last hope, a common practice in other countries where shipping lines received support:
*   Denmark lent $6 billion to Maersk in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   Germany lent $1.8 billion to Hapag-Lloyd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.
*   France lent $660 million to CMA CGM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
*   China gave $9.5 billion to Cosco and China Shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

However, KDB was also dealing with another troubled shipping line, Hyundai Merchant Marine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. KDB demanded that both restructure chartering contracts, cut debt, and receive capital injections from their ownership families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Hyundai was able to comply, but Hanjin could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

The Korean government's decision not to bail out Hanjin had "echoes of the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. While the rationale was to avoid using taxpayer money for "corporate fat cats," particularly the family associated with the "nut rage lady," there may have been a better way to handle the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

## Aftermath and Legacy

Hanjin's insolvency in August 2016 caused significant disruption to the global shipping market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
*   159 companies were unable to retrieve their cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   Hanjin ceased paying terminal fees, leaving $4 billion worth of goods stranded at sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
*   This included critical Korean export goods, as Hanjin shipped 40% of Samsung's electronics and 20% of LG's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
*   Walmart, for example, had 3,000 containers at sea or in terminals at the time of the collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.
*   Hanjin's collapse also led to the annihilation of tens of thousands of shipyard jobs in both Korea and the Philippines, where Hanjin owned the Subic Bay Shipyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

Despite vigorous protests from trade groups and unions, the Korean government remained firm in its decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

Other countries handled similar situations differently:
*   Singapore, facing losses with its national champion container line Neptune Orient Lines (NOL), opted to divest from the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. NOL was sold to French operator CMA CGM for $2.4 billion USD shortly before Hanjin's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Hanjin's collapse, ironically, helped NOL turn a profit shortly after its sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.
*   In contrast, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Taiwan government bailed out its two container shipping lines, Evergreen and Yang Ming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. Taiwan's Deputy Minister of Transportation, Wang Kuai, stated that "the nation relies on shipping firms to transport goods... which is key to our economic development" and that Hanjin's collapse showed that "the government has to provide support to the industry before the damage becomes uncontrollable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

## Reasons for Collapse

Hanjin Shipping's demise was primarily due to two factors:
1.  **Working Capital Crisis**: The company ran into a working capital crisis despite owning profitable assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Poor chartering practices left Hanjin with unprofitable ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Following the founder's death and the splitting of his transportation empire, there was no "rich sibling company" to provide a bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
2.  **Government Decision Not to Bail Out**: The Korean government decided not to bail out the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. While other companies made similar mistakes, they received government backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. After years of supporting the shipping industry as a core national interest, the Korean government appeared to have reversed this policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

After entering court receivership, Hanjin attempted to negotiate with its chartering and debt partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. However, with over 1.3 trillion Korean Won ($1 billion USD) in charter fees owed over the next 12 months, the company was unable to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Hanjin Shipping declared bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>, and its last ship was sold for demolition in March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

The National Steel Corporation (NSC) was once a significant part of Philippine industry, employing over 4,000 workers in Iligan City and serving as a rare example of a well-run government-owned company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite the Philippines having an early start in building a steel industry compared to most other Asian countries, NSC ultimately declined and failed by 1999 due to a confluence of factors, including foreign competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Early Ambitions and Dependence

After World War II, the Philippine economy was primarily agricultural and semi-colonial, with a lack of suitable steel facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This meant the country had to export its iron ore to Japan and then reimport finished steel products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. President Carlos Garcia initiated an industrialization push, viewing the country's metallic minerals like iron, copper, gold, and nickel as building blocks for an industrialized future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The establishment of an integrated steel mill was seen as crucial to enable the country to build its own ships, roads, and electric power infrastructure, and to open doors for specialty alloys and industrial chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## The Struggle of Early Steel Ventures

In 1950, the Philippine government established the National Shipyard and Steel Corporation (NASCO) in Iligan City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. NASCO's steel mill converted scrap metal into products mainly for ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. In 1955, NASCO received 50 million pesos to set up pig iron plants, which would transform it into an integrated steel mill, making it Asia's second such facility after Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

However, a currency crisis in the Philippines affected NASCO's plans, necessitating foreign loans for steel-making equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The United States Export-Import (Exim) Bank offered a $62.4 million loan, but with conditions: the money had to be spent solely on American steel-making equipment, and NASCO had to be privatized, with 49% sold to a private investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This privatization was reportedly insisted upon due to past bureaucratic inefficiencies or, as some sources suggest, by American steel companies seeking protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The joint venture, Iligan Integrated Steel Mills (ISMI), was set up with Jacinto Steel as the private investor, who later bought the entire company in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

ISMI struggled to be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. One perspective points to the Jacinto family cross-subsidizing other ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Another view highlights the government's failure to adequately protect the company, noting that ISMI faced domestic competition and did not receive the same level of support as steel companies in other parts of Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. For instance, Japan's government provided its six domestic steel companies with raw goods subsidies, bans on imported steel, and extensive tax incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## NSC's Era and the Rise of Imports

After martial law was declared in 1972, the military seized ISMI's assets and transferred them to National Steel Corporation (NSC), a development bank subsidiary, completing the process by 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. NSC absorbed other bankrupt local steel factories, expanding its capacity significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. By 1979, NSC became the Philippines' leading producer of billets, tin plates, and flat-rolled steel, holding a monopoly over the country's steel industry for the next two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. NSC's flat steel products were even exported to China, Indonesia, and the United States, which preferred NSC's products over domestic competitors despite shipping costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

However, challenges emerged in the 1980s when trade reforms lowered steel product tariffs to 3%, leading to an influx of cheap imports from Taiwan and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. While NSC initially weathered this challenge and remained profitable, its market for core flat steel products began to decline into the 1990s due to these cheaper imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Incumbents in the industry needed to upgrade and many were moving into coils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## Privatization and Incompetent Management

Recognizing the need for significant investment to stay competitive and upgrade its facilities, NSC, which still lacked true vertical integration and iron/steel making capabilities, sought capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The government, with too much exposure to state-owned corporations, decided to seek a private investor to take over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

In 1993, a Malaysian company called Wing Tiek Holdings, which were foreign steel traders rather than steelmakers, won the bid for a majority share in NSC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. The transaction was finalized in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. This new management team, with little understanding of steel production, made poor decisions, such as ordering massive quantities of raw steel goods at peak prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Losses skyrocketed, and the company laid off employees for the first time since 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Despite 1996 being one of the best economic years in Philippine history, NSC lost 2 billion pesos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## The Asian Financial Crisis and Final Collapse

In early 1997, Wing Tiek sold NSC to another Malaysian trading firm, Hautic Investment Limited, which was highly leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The [[impact_of_the_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | Asian financial crisis of 1997]] proved disastrous for Hautic's plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Another Malaysian management team, also lacking experience, took over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Planned upgrades never materialized, previous upgrades lacked maintenance, and cheap imported products continued to flow into the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The crisis led to a massive devaluation of the peso, making NSC's U.S. dollar-denominated loans and raw materials prohibitively expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Creditors and suppliers ended relationships, and employees took early retirement buyouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

In November 1999, NSC ceased operations, resulting in 1,800 employees losing their jobs and a 72 million peso drop in Iligan City's revenues that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

## Post-Closure Attempts and Broader Impact

In 2004, an Indian group, Global Steel Philippines Inc. (GSPI), purchased NSC's assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. Although connected to Mittal Steel (now the second-largest steel company globally), GSPI also failed to take off due to a chronic lack of funds and an adversarial relationship with the local community and government, leading to another closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

While cheap imports did contribute to the decline of NSC's original core markets, the company was still profitable into 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Ultimately, NSC's downfall is attributed to its fall into the hands of an incompetent management team, which coincided with an unprecedented financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. The decline and fall of NSC had widespread effects on Iligan City and its supporting industries, with estimated losses of 1.4 billion pesos annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. This phenomenon of cheap imports causing the downfall of domestic industries also impacted other Philippine sectors, such as cement, where Indonesian and Taiwanese imports led to the closure of local plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

Today, the 145-hectare plant and its adjacent housing complex in Iligan City serve as a reminder of what could have been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

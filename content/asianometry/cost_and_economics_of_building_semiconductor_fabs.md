The semiconductor industry is characterized by high volatility, with booms and busts following each other rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Even in normal times, conditions are unpredictable, with shipments soaring 70% one year and crashing 40% the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The industry is currently experiencing a significant chip shortage, leading to widespread efforts to build or expand fabrication facilities (fabs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Dynamics of Supply and Demand

Effective planning and forecasting of capacity can prevent shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. However, accurate forecasting is challenging because end-users do not directly purchase microchips in large quantities; instead, vendors buy them to incorporate into consumer goods like PCs and smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Chips have a short shelf life due to the constant introduction of new products that threaten to make current iterations obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Foundry customers frequently demand immediate production and shipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Their concern about securing stock during uncertain periods can lead to "double booking" orders, where customers place identical orders with multiple foundries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. TSMC Chairman Mark Liu identified double booking as a primary reason the recent chip shortage was not as severe as it appeared, attributing it to the pandemic and ongoing China-America trade tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The latter, having no clear end in sight, is expected to perpetuate some level of double booking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Demand is also significantly influenced by the broader macro-economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. As electronics are consumer items, purchases of iPhones and laptops decline during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. For example, semiconductor business cycle downturns in 1975, 1982, and 1991 were linked to oil shocks, and another occurred during the Asian Financial Crisis of 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. While the industry experienced a shortage in 2020, in March of that year, the stock market was down 25%, and experts predicted a global economic collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. However, stimulus packages led to a faster-than-anticipated economic rebound in Q3 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

A 2005 study found that semiconductor down cycles are more often triggered by surges in inventory levels and fab capacity (over-supply) rather than a decrease in demand (under-demand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## The Economics of a Fab

### High Fixed Costs

Building a semiconductor fab requires substantial capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. While Moore's Law observes that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, "Moore's Second Law," also known as Rock's Law, states that the cost of semiconductor tools doubles every four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. These tools constitute 75% of a fab's total cost, driving expenses upward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

The cost of a leading-edge fab has escalated dramatically:
*   **2000**: $1 billion (twice the cost in 1995) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   **2005**: $3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
*   **2020**: TSMC's N5 fab in Tainan cost approximately $17 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
*   **Future**: TSMC's next-generation N3 process fab in Tainan is estimated at $19.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>

Efforts are made to slow the rate of Rock's Law, similar to accelerating Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Companies explore various techniques and financial methods to reduce these costs, each with trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Nonetheless, foundries must invest billions before they can even begin to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Amortization and Marginal Costs

Once built, new fabs quickly lose value, much like a new car driven off a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. While construction costs are largely fixed, the marginal cost of producing an additional chip is nearly zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This incentivizes foundries to make and sell as many chips as possible to amortize their high fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Market Dynamics: Oversupply and Price Wars

When supply exceeds demand, prices collapse, reducing profit margins for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Despite this, foundries are incentivized to sell every chip they can produce, even if it generates only a small gross profit, to contribute to their future survival costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

Industry leaders like TSMC and Samsung prioritize market share over profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. They avoid mothballing capacity to prevent business from going to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Due to their massive economies of scale, they can drive market prices down to their survival price, which is significantly lower than that of other industry players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This dynamic leads to fierce downcycles that eliminate lower-performing companies through bankruptcies and buyouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Subsequently, supply re-balances with demand, resetting the cycle in anticipation of the next chip shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Government Subsidies and Their Impact

There is considerable discussion about [[government_subsidies_and_investments_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | government subsidies]] for fab construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Examples include:
*   China's $20 billion semiconductor plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>
*   U.S. President Joe Biden's $50 billion stimulus plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>
*   The European Union's 145 billion euro initiative for a 2-nanometer cutting-edge fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>

In the U.S., proposed legislation includes the CHIPS Act and the American Foundries Act, which would establish an R&D fund and a 20-40% tax credit for acquiring semiconductor production equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. While tax credits might offer short-term impacts over three to five years or one fab generation, an R&D fund is seen as having longer-term effects, particularly in fostering public-private partnerships like the one that created EUV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

While acknowledging the importance of national sovereignty and [[government_subsidies_and_investments_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | government investment]] in high-priority sectors, concerns exist regarding the self-sustainability of commercially-driven initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Subsidies, by their nature, create distortions to achieve specific goals, such as bringing more manufacturing to the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. However, unless these subsidies are permanent, subsidized fabs will eventually need to become self-reliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Continued subsidies would likely face increased scrutiny once current chip shortages affecting industries like automotive are resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Current Global Fab Build-Out

The world is currently experiencing a significant global expansion of fab capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Examples include:
*   TSMC's Arizona fab, which has been under construction for a year and may be upscaled from its original plan of 20,000 wafers per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This facility could eventually produce 25,000 to 100,000 wafer starts per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   Samsung's negotiations for a multi-billion dollar investment to expand its Austin fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   Smaller, second-tier foundries are also upgrading or building out their fab capacity, with numerous press releases from companies without process nodes under 10nm announcing new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   Global Foundries is investing $1.4 billion in expansion and advancing its IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   [[economic_viability_of_smics_chip_production | SMIC]] is receiving funds from the Shenzhen government for a $2.35 billion project, expected to produce 40,000 wafers per month upon completion in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

This flurry of activity indicates a substantial increase in future capacity, potentially hundreds of thousands of wafers entering the market over the next one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. It is uncertain if demand has increased sufficiently to absorb this capacity, especially as people return to in-person activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The U.S. government, for instance, purchases 1.9 billion semiconductors annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, but one month of output from a 50,000 wafer/month TSMC Arizona fab alone could theoretically yield 3.5 billion dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:11:03]</a>. The current boom in the semiconductor industry raises questions about its duration and the inevitability of a subsequent bust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

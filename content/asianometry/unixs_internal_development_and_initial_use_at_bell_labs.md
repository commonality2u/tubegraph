In the nascent days of computing, code was tightly bound to specific machines, necessitating rewrites with every hardware upgrade, a process widely acknowledged as wasteful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The need arose for a software development platform capable of accommodating diverse hardware without being prohibitively expensive, ideally managed by a global team of volunteers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This aspiration eventually led to the emergence of the Unix operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Beginnings: The Multics Project

The journey towards Unix began in 1965 when scientists at [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] collaborated with peers from MIT and General Electric on a project known as "Multiplexed Information and Computing Service," or [[the_multics_project_and_its_impact_on_unix | Multics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The objective of [[the_multics_project_and_its_impact_on_unix | Multics]] was to create a general-purpose utility for sharing computer time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Given the high cost of computers, time-sharing operating systems were crucial for multiple users to efficiently share resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. These systems evolved into communication tools, connecting users and featuring public profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

General Electric, which sold time shares for its computer systems, provided the [[the_multics_project_and_its_impact_on_unix | Multics]] team with a GE 645 mainframe, simulated by a 635 computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. [[the_multics_project_and_its_impact_on_unix | Multics]] pioneered concepts such as arbitrary file names, directory structures, and a virtual memory system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Virtual memory allowed secondary storage like hard drives to function as part of main memory (RAM), enabling computers to handle more data than their physical RAM allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This was a significant improvement over existing file systems and remains in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The [[the_multics_project_and_its_impact_on_unix | Multics]] team aimed to integrate these disparate ideas into a single commercial product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## The End of Multics and the Rise of Unix

Ultimately, the [[the_multics_project_and_its_impact_on_unix | Multics]] project faced challenges due to its ambitious scope, excessive spending, and vague planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Frustrated by the lack of a functional product, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] formally withdrew from the [[the_multics_project_and_its_impact_on_unix | Multics]] project in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Shortly after, General Electric exited the computer industry entirely, selling its division to Honeywell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Despite the official withdrawal, a small group of scientists at the [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] Computing Science Research Center—Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Rudd Canaday, Doug McIlroy, and J.F. Ossanna—persisted in their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The cessation of [[the_multics_project_and_its_impact_on_unix | Multics]] meant losing access to the GE 635 computer they had been using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Ken Thompson, who had developed a space game called "Space Travel" for the GE computer, found its play prohibitively expensive (around $50-75 per session) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

In 1969, Thompson discovered an unused, graphics-capable PDP-7 minicomputer and decided to rewrite "Space Travel" for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This project required him to re-implement core components like a debugging subsystem and a floating-point arithmetic package from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The development was tedious, involving carrying paper tapes from the GE computer's OS to the PDP-7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### A New File System

After completing "Space Travel," Thompson focused on implementing ideas for a new file system he had discussed with Dennis Ritchie and Canaday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Within a day or two, he "hacked out" an implementation of this file system on the PDP-7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Thompson and his colleagues then added simple utilities for copying, printing, deleting, and editing files, along with a basic command interpreter—a shell—to run other programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

The concept of the "file" became central: an abstract interface for data operations like reading or writing, independent of the file's content, which abstracted away hardware differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This enabled users on different devices to modify files, becoming a "killer app" for Unix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. By the end of summer 1969, the entire system had been rewritten, becoming distinct from the original GECOS operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Initially, it was not called an operating system but rather a convenient platform for software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Around 1970, team member Brian Kernighan suggested the name "Unics," a "treacherous pun" on [[the_multics_project_and_its_impact_on_unix | Multics]], which later evolved into "Unix" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## The Usefulness of Unix at Bell Labs

While Unix on the PDP-7 offered a decent programming environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, the PDP-7 was an outdated minicomputer introduced in 1964 and not even owned by the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. In 1970, the team requested a recently introduced DEC PDP-11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Previous requests for new computers had been rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, but this time the request was granted, partly because the PDP-11 was cheaper at $65,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Crucially, the request included a compelling pitch: to use the file system for creating and editing text files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Unix was rewritten for the PDP-11's low-level assembly language, now incorporating a text editor and "roff," a typesetting markup language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The Unix operating system was then offered to the [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] Patent Department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. They chose Unix over commercial alternatives because Thompson and Ritchie quickly enabled "roff" to produce line-numbered pages, a crucial feature for patent documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. What began with three typists in the Patent Department quickly grew into a popular internal product across the entire [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] organization, complete with multiple versions and its own support group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Unix Spreads Beyond Bell Labs

Although Unix was originally intended as an internal tool for [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, it rapidly spread throughout the computing community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Its unexpected popularity stemmed from several factors:

*   **Humble Hardware Requirements**: Unix was developed on relatively modest hardware, making it accessible to programmers who often had limited budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. A standard Unix computer, often a PDP-11/40, cost between $50,000 and $150,000 in 1977 dollars, significantly cheaper than mainframes costing upwards of half a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Written in C**: Unix was the first operating system written in a higher-level programming language, "C," developed by Dennis Ritchie from Ken Thompson's "B" (which was ported from Martin Richards' BCPL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Programming in C was far easier than in low-level assembly language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This made Unix easy to port to different hardware architectures beyond the PDP family and simpler to modify and enhance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Low Acquisition Cost**: Crucially, Unix was inexpensive to acquire. AT&T and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] sold the Unix source code to non-profits like universities for just a few hundred dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This contrasted sharply with other software companies that zealously guarded their source code and prohibited modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### The AT&T Consent Decree

This open approach was not entirely altruistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. In 1956, AT&T settled an antitrust lawsuit with the U.S. government, resulting in the 1956 AT&T Consent Decree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This decree stipulated that in exchange for a legal monopoly on the U.S. telephone system, AT&T had to make all its inventions available to the academic community free of charge or license them under fair and reasonable terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The decree also barred AT&T from entering the computer business, rendering Unix commercially useless for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This legal constraint ironically facilitated the widespread distribution of Unix, much as it had earlier for the [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | transistor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

AT&T managers, wary of violating the decree, shied away from providing support to their licensees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This lack of official support serendipitously encouraged university students, with their ingenuity and time, to collaborate on implementing desired features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. By the early 1970s, Unix had achieved global reach, running on university computers in Australia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Conclusion

Unix, born from the remnants of the [[the_multics_project_and_its_impact_on_unix | Multics]] project at [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]], pioneered powerful concepts that laid the groundwork for the modern software industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Its initial development was driven by the interests of its creators, rather than commercial motives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. The unique circumstances of the AT&T Consent Decree, coupled with its flexible design and accessibility, ensured its rapid dissemination and evolution beyond the confines of [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]], setting the stage for its subsequent commercial explosion.

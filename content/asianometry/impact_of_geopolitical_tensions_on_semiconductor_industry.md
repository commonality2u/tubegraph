China represents a massive market for major semiconductor companies like Intel and AMD, with sales figures often on par with or exceeding those from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This significant market presence, combined with geopolitical factors, has spurred China's interest in developing homegrown alternatives to American semiconductor technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## China's Drive for Domestic Alternatives

China's pursuit of domestic alternatives in critical technologies, particularly computer chips, stems from several key geopolitical and strategic motivations:

*   **Espionage Concerns** The Edward Snowden revelations regarding American spying on foreign allies and competitors raised significant alarm bells globally, prompting a closer look at the implementation of American technologies in critical use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Competition** There is a recognized increase in competition between China and the United States, marking a shift from the previous age of openness that followed the Sino-Soviet split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **National Champions** China desires to cultivate homegrown "national champions" in critical industries such as high-speed rail, solar, space, and now computer chips, as a point of national and patriotic pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The country has initiated various programs to lead in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Export Bans and Technology Cutoffs** The Trump administration's actions to cut off Chinese companies, such as Huawei, from accessing American technologies, intensified China's fears and reinforced the need for domestic self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This directly relates to the [[impact_of_export_bans_on_semiconductor_technology | Impact of export bans on semiconductor technology]].

These factors collectively push China to develop domestic x86 chips to supply its massive user base, especially in a worst-case scenario where access to foreign technology might be restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Chinese Homegrown x86 Chips

There are two distinct lineages of homegrown x86 chips available in the Chinese market: Zhaoxin and Hygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Zhaoxin

Zhaoxin is considered the older lineage with potentially better future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. They have been releasing CPUs since 2014, marketing them as domestically made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

*   **Origins**: Zhaoxin is a fabless semiconductor joint venture between the Shanghai municipal government and Taiwan's Via Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Via Technologies holds a rare x86 architectural license, acquired through its 1999 purchases of Cyrix and Centaur Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Via's acquisition of Centaur led to a prolonged patent battle with Intel, which concluded with a 10-year cross-license agreement in 2003, extended by a three-year grace period in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Performance**: Zhaoxin architectures are direct descendants of Centaur Technologies' work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Tests on their latest sixth-generation chips, Luchador, indicate that their performance lags about four to eight years behind the latest American designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. However, they consume less power, reflecting their mobile and IoT origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. While adequate for China's low-end needs, they are not yet globally competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Foundry Shift**: For national security reasons, Zhaoxin, a fabless company, has been attempting to switch from TSMC to a mainland alternative like SMIC for fabrication, which is likely causing delays and performance loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This highlights [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics | global semiconductor supply chain dynamics]] and geopolitical influence.
*   **Future Plans**: Zhaoxin has also announced intentions to enter the discrete GPU market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Hygon

The second Chinese x86 joint venture initiative involves AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

*   **AMD's Joint Venture**: In 2015, AMD, facing financial difficulties, formed a joint venture to provide the Chinese market with a version of its Zen 1 x86 chips that could be called "Chinese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This venture, called Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co-limited (THATIC), brought in over $200 million for AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Complex Structure and Technology Transfer**: AMD structured the joint venture in a two-layer system to control its intellectual property (IP) while allowing the Chinese to claim the chips as homegrown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   The first layer was Haiguang Microelectronics (HMC), 51% owned by AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
    *   The second was Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit Design Company (Hygon), of which AMD only owned 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    *   AMD created IP for a special x86 server chip, which was handed to HMC (AMD-controlled). HMC would remove sensitive elements before passing the design to Hygon. Hygon would make changes and design the top-level architecture. The chip would then be sent back to HMC/AMD for approval, finishing, and fabrication at GlobalFoundries, before returning to Hygon for packaging and sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **U.S. Government Scrutiny**: The Wall Street Journal reported on this structure, leading to pushback. AMD stated they briefed the U.S. Departments of Defense and Commerce and received a green light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. However, the Department of Defense reportedly disagreed with the Treasury's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. While AMD claimed the chips were for commercial purposes, job postings and interviews in China suggested they would be used in new exa-scale supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Concerns**: The complex arrangement, while designed to adhere to best practices for managing foreign technology joint ventures by keeping the most valuable IP separate, also made detecting inadvertent technology transfers more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. In 2019, THATIC was placed on an entity list, and AMD agreed to halt further technology transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. While the original IP remains with THATIC, AMD has moved on to sell its newer chips directly to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The development of Chinese x86 chips has raised alarm in the U.S., given the perceived value of x86 and the importance of technology transfer to national catch-up strategies in countries like China, Korea, Taiwan, and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

However, the landscape is evolving:

*   **x86's Diminishing Dominance**: x86 no longer holds the commanding lead it once did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. ARM is making significant inroads into areas traditionally dominated by x86, including desktops and servers <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **China's Strategic Focus**: In China, x86 development is a niche within broader indigenous semiconductor efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Chips produced for domestic consumption cannot easily be exported due to potential litigation and lack global competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. China's primary focus is on ARM-based chips, which constitute an estimated 95% of chips designed in China, and increasingly on RISC-V, an open-source instruction set backed by major players like Alibaba Cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Competitive Gap**: Despite advancements, Chinese x86 chips still lag many years behind their American-made competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Their impact on the market will likely remain limited as long as Intel and AMD chips are readily available in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The continued availability of these chips, however, is not a given amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

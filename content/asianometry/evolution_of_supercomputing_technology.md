The story of supercomputing is deeply intertwined with the lifelong quest of [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Seymour Cray]] to build the biggest and fastest computers in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. His ambition was singularly focused on pushing the limits of computational power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Early Developments: ERA and Control Data Corporation

[[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Seymour Cray]] began his career in 1950 at Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in St. Paul, Minnesota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. ERA originated from a US Navy team of elite code-breakers during World War II, known as the Communications Supplementary Activity - Washington (CSAW) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This division secretly designed powerful machines to break Axis naval codes, particularly to find German submarines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. After the war, the need for code-breaking, especially of Soviet codes, continued, leading to the formation of ERA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

ERA's initial products were code-breaking machines, but the team quickly transitioned to general-purpose computers, leveraging new technologies like magnetic drum memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Their ERA 1101 was a commercialized version of a device sold to a precursor of the NSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. In the 1950s, Minnesota, particularly due to its strong military presence, was a leading computing center in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]], at 25, designed the control system for ERA's ERA 1103 computer, which required comprehensive knowledge of the computer's architecture to efficiently execute programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

In 1951, ERA was acquired by Remington Rand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Remington Rand had also previously acquired Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation, known for creating ENIAC, the first programmable digital computer, and EDVAC, which pioneered the stored program computer design foundational to the Von Neumann architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Their UNIVAC I gained fame for predicting the 1952 US presidential election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Under Remington Rand, Eckert–Mauchly focused on business computing, while ERA focused on scientific computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

This specialization highlighted the distinction between business and scientific computing needs at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Business computers performed simple operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying) with limited accuracy but at high scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Scientific computing demanded complex calculations with high accuracy (up to 20-30 decimal points), often running for hours to produce a single result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

Tensions arose when Remington Rand merged with Sperry Corporation to become Sperry Rand in 1955, forcing the two units into one Univac division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. In 1957, William Norris, VP of Operations at ERA, left Sperry Rand to found Control Data Corporation (CDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]] joined him, having grown dissatisfied with Sperry Rand's management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### The CDC 1604

At CDC, [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]] persuaded his co-founders to build scientific computers, targeting universities and nuclear weapons research labs that valued raw compute power over marketing and client service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Nuclear simulations, for example, required the biggest and fastest computers available to model chain reactions over micro-seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

[[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]] believed he could build such a computer cost-effectively using transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. He even used reject bipolar transistors from a local electronics shop, pairing them in a Darlington configuration to amplify weak signals, demonstrating that effective design could compensate for substandard components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

In 1958, CDC secured a deal with the US Navy for the CDC 1604 computer, which was launched in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Priced at $990,000 (about $10.4 million today) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>, it was the most powerful commercially available computer of its time, operating at 0.2 megahertz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### The Concept of a Supercomputer

A supercomputer is defined by its ability to push the boundaries of computing, leading its field in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Other concurrent developments included UNIVAC's Livermore Automatic Reaction Calculator (LARC) in 1960, which aided in hydrogen bomb simulations and was the world's most powerful computer from 1960 to 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. IBM responded with the IBM 7030 STRETCH supercomputer, designed by Gene Amdahl, which held the crown until 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. However, the LARC and STRETCH were largely made-to-order products, with UNIVAC producing only two LARC units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Control Data, with the 1604, commercialized the supercomputer as a successful product category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

## The CDC 6600: A Leap in Performance

Post-1604, [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]]'s desire to build the fastest machine clashed with CDC's interest in the business data processing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This led to a split, with [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]] leading a team in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, to develop a machine 15 times faster than the 1604: the CDC 6600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

The 6600 incorporated several innovations:
*   **Silicon Planar Transistors**: [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]] sourced faster silicon planar transistors from Fairchild, providing an immediate 5x speed boost over germanium transistors used in the 1604 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Denser Modules**: The 6600 abandoned the 1604's air-cooled pluggable building blocks due to extensive back panel wiring that caused noise and limited I/O <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Instead, it used "cordwood modules" with shorter wires, which improved speed but required freon gas cooling and made repairs difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
*   **Parallelism**: The 6600 featured 11 individual computers sharing a central memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Ten handled secondary work like peripherals, leaving one main processor dedicated to high-speed math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   **Simplified Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**: The 6600's ISA was simplified, removing instructions unrelated to scientific computing (e.g., for large data handling, common in commercial use) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This allowed for task "pipelining," breaking jobs into smaller ones for simultaneous processing by peripheral computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

The first CDC 6600 was delivered to Lawrence Livermore in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Its speed, three times faster than IBM's 7030, shocked the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. Over 100 CDC 6600s were sold, primarily to government and university labs, solidifying CDC's position in the supercomputer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

## [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research]] and the Cray-1

Disagreements with CDC management over strategy led [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]] to leave and found [[cray_research_and_development_of_the_cray1 | Cray Research]] in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. His new company's goal was to build single, state-of-the-art supercomputers like a master artisan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.

For his first machine, the Cray-1, [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]] introduced **vector processing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. Unlike scalar CPUs that process single data items one at a time, vector processors handle single-dimension arrays of data (vectors), significantly reducing instruction count for repetitive operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]] addressed a weakness in CDC's earlier STAR-100 vector computer by introducing **vector registers**, fast intermediate memory systems that acted like cache to improve data loading and storing, which had been a bottleneck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

For the first time, [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]] adopted **integrated circuits (ICs)**, allowing for greater density and reduced wiring, making the Cray-1 significantly smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. He typically preferred older, more reliable technologies, but for memory, he broke this principle, using bipolar semiconductor memory chips for their cost-effectiveness, density, and lower power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. The Cray-1 had a clock cycle of 12.5 nanoseconds, making it five times faster than the CDC 7600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. This extreme speed necessitated very short wire lengths (under four feet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. The machine was also known for its iconic circular shape, designed to accommodate its new cooling scheme, and its distinctive aesthetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.

Released in 1976, the Cray-1's speed and design made a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. One hundred units were sold to government and university labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

## Evolving Competition and Parallel Processing

In the 1980s, new competitors emerged. Japanese companies like Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC leveraged their strengths in VLSI semiconductor production to create compelling supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. By 1988, Cray still held 56% of the traditional supercomputer market, but Japanese firms collectively had 37% and were gaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.

Supercomputer startups like Thinking Machines and nCUBE began exploring **Massively Parallel Systems (MPPs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>. These systems coordinated many commercial microprocessors to achieve millions or billions of floating-point operations per second, offering a better price-to-performance ratio by using off-the-shelf components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.

### The Cray X-MP

While [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]] worked on the ambitious Cray-2 (released in 1985 with a complex liquid immersion cooling system) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>, the Cray X-MP supercomputer emerged from a separate team led by Les Davis and Steve Chen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. Released in 1983, the X-MP introduced **parallel processing** with four CPUs and new solid-state storage semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. It became the world's fastest supercomputer (2-5 times faster than the Cray-1S) without the radical design changes of the Cray-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. The X-MP and its successor, the Y-MP, sold nearly 200 units by 1989, significantly outselling the Cray-2's 24 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.

## The Decline of "Big Iron" and the Rise of Parallelism

[[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]]'s next ambitious project, the Cray-3, aimed to use gallium arsenide semiconductors for even faster switching performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. However, the project faced delays and customer cancellations due to cratering defense demand after the fall of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>. Only one Cray-3 system was sold before [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]] Computer Corporation filed for bankruptcy in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.

[[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Seymour Cray]]'s cherished approach of "sitting down with a clean sheet of paper" to build a "big iron" supercomputer was no longer financially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. He formed a new company, SRC Computers, to explore parallel designs before his passing in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

Today's semiconductor makers face similar challenges to those [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]] encountered, including thermal problems, interconnect issues, and memory retrieval slowdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>. However, unlike [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray]]'s ability to "throw it all out and start anew," the semiconductor industry cannot afford such radical restarts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. This highlights a fundamental shift in the [[evolution_of_ai_hardware_and_gpus | evolution of AI hardware and GPUs]] and supercomputing development towards more iterative improvements and complex optimization strategies.

Liang Mong Song, described as one of [[TSMC]]'s founding geniuses, is renowned for his unquestionable brilliance in semiconductor technology, though he was also known for being scathingly difficult to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. His career at [[TSMC]] spanned nearly two decades before his dramatic defections to [[Samsung]] and later [[SMIC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Early Career and Achievements at [[TSMC]]

Liang was one of [[TSMC]]'s brightest rising stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Education**: He graduated from [[Taiwan]]'s National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) and pursued graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, under Professor Hu Ten-Ming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Professor Hu, a [[TSMC]] legend, was one of the company's first technical hires and later served as Chief Technology Officer, playing a key role in bringing the FinFET to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Prior to [[TSMC]]**: Liang received his PhD and worked at [[AMD]] for over a decade, accumulating over 180 critical semiconductor patents and publishing more than 350 technical papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Joining [[TSMC]]**: In 1992, at age 40, Liang returned to [[Taiwan]] to join [[TSMC]]'s R&D department, becoming part of a group of brilliant semiconductor minds returning from the [[United States]] to contribute their talents to [[Taiwan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This group included Professor Hu, [[Chang Yi]] (future CTO), Rick Tsai (future CEO of [[TSMC]] and MediaTek), Douglas Yu (now a [[TSMC]] distinguished fellow), and [[Morris Chang]] himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Key Contributions**: Liang, a specialist in FinFET technology, played a critical role in [[TSMC]]'s technical advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. He was instrumental in [[TSMC]]'s decision to reject [[IBM]]'s copper interconnect technology license and instead develop their own 130-nanometer process node with copper interconnects, shipping wafers by 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This allowed [[TSMC]] to overtake [[IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. For his contributions, he was awarded the 2003 Outstanding Scientific and Technological Worker award by the [[Taiwan]]ese government alongside [[Chang Yi]] and Robin Berlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. He is named on nearly 500 [[TSMC]] patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Compensation**: [[TSMC]] rewarded him handsomely; his total stock and cash compensation over 17 years exceeded $21 million USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. In the 2000s, he earned over $1 million annually, significantly higher than the average [[Taiwan]]ese income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Personality and Internal Conflicts

Despite his brilliance, Liang's stubborn nature led to frequent clashes with colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. He was described as "very strict on technology, very rigorous," with "no negotiation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. His future colleagues in [[China]] would complain about his inflexibility and aloofness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. In [[Taiwan]], he was likened to Lu Bu, a mighty Chinese general known for his incredible warrior skills, but also for his ferocious temper and betrayal of allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### The "Game of Thrones" at [[TSMC]]

In 2005, when [[Morris Chang]] retired as CEO, Rick Tsai was chosen as his successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This triggered a shuffle, and when senior R&D VP [[Chang Yi]] retired in 2009, an R&D leadership position opened up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Liang believed he was the best candidate, but [[Chang Yi]] chose Jack Sun, another brilliant R&D rival, who had a broader view of [[TSMC]]'s operations and better social skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Liang was instead transferred to lead a new "Beyond More" initiative, focusing on expanding [[TSMC]]'s trailing edge foundry capabilities into areas like MEMS, automotive sensors, and advanced packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. This was a small business at the time, starting with a four-person office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Liang, whose technical obsession was with the leading edge, viewed this as an "effective banishment to a far off province" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. His resentment grew, feeling that company leadership had "thrown him aside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## Defection to [[Samsung]]

In February 2009, Liang resigned from [[TSMC]] after 17 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. His resignation agreement included "golden handcuffs," holding back a significant portion of his payout until he fulfilled a two-year non-compete agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. He told [[TSMC]] he would spend the time caring for his parents and teaching at National Tsing Hua University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

However, in October 2010, six months into his supposed sabbatical, he took a visiting scholar position at Sungkyunkwan University in Korea, which has close ties with [[Samsung]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Around this time, [[Samsung]] began rapidly closing the gap with [[TSMC]] in process nodes, moving from 45 nanometers to 32 nanometers and then 28 nanometers in just two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Liang repeatedly denied media reports of him working for [[Samsung]], swearing he would never work there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

On July 2011, two months after his non-compete expired, Liang officially joined [[Samsung]] as Executive Vice President of [[Samsung]] Foundry and Technical Director of [[Samsung]] LSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. He brought a team of 10 to 20 [[TSMC]] engineers with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Four months later, [[TSMC]] filed a lawsuit in [[Taiwan]] against Liang, alleging he had broken his non-compete agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

### Impact at [[Samsung]]

Liang's defection had a deep impact on [[TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Upon his arrival, Liang pushed [[Samsung]] to directly jump from 28 nanometers to 14 nanometers, adopting FinFET technology simultaneously â€“ a monumental three-generation leap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. In 2015, [[Samsung]] announced they had successfully brought out a 14-nanometer process node ahead of [[TSMC]]'s 16-nanometer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

This stunning move broke [[TSMC]]'s near-complete monopoly in advanced semiconductor foundries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. [[Samsung]] leveraged its first FinFET-based implementation to lure away significant [[TSMC]] customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>:
*   **Qualcomm**: Announced a billion-dollar deal for [[Samsung]] to produce their high-end mobile chips, a major blow as Qualcomm had always used [[TSMC]] for these chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **Apple**: For the [[Apple]] A9 chip in the iPhone 6s, [[Apple]] split production between [[TSMC]] and [[Samsung]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. This was a warning to [[TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
At a shareholder meeting in January 2015, [[Morris Chang]] publicly admitted, "yes, we are a bit behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

### Lawsuit and [[TSMC]]'s Response

[[TSMC]] pursued its lawsuit against Liang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   **First Trial**: Liang initially prevailed, with the judge ruling in his favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.
*   **Second Trial**: [[TSMC]] appealed and presented new evidence, including that Liang's lectures at Sungkyunkwan University were to [[Samsung]] employees on [[Samsung]]'s campus, technical analyses showing [[Samsung]]'s chips becoming technically close to [[TSMC]]'s after 2009, and Liang's use of a [[Samsung]] email address as early as 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. The judge ruled in [[TSMC]]'s favor, a decision upheld by the [[Taiwan]] Supreme Court, mandating that Liang could not work for [[Samsung]] until after the end of 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

The distraction of the court battle and its final decision likely affected [[Samsung]]'s manufacturing progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. In 2015, [[Samsung]] encountered issues with their [[Apple]] A9 chips, with netizens reporting higher temperatures and lower battery life compared to [[TSMC]]'s counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

Meanwhile, [[Morris Chang]] spurred [[TSMC]] to mobilize a massive R&D effort to retake node leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. [[Apple]]'s next chip, the A10, became a [[TSMC]] exclusive and has remained so since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. [[TSMC]] has since maintained its position as the leading semiconductor foundry, with [[Samsung]] in second place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

## Defection to [[SMIC]]

In 2015, [[SMIC]]'s new chairman, Dao, aimed to bring [[SMIC]] back to the leading edge and believed [[Taiwan]]ese talents could achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. He first recruited [[TSMC]]'s "godfather of semiconductor R&D," [[Chang Yi]], who joined in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. Then, he targeted Liang himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.

Liang agreed to join [[SMIC]] only if he could hand-pick a team of 200 [[Taiwan]]ese and South Korean engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. [[SMIC]] complied, recruiting them for over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. This time, they respected the non-compete clause with [[Samsung]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. When his [[Samsung]] contract ended in 2017, Liang, the "semiconductor Lu Bu," joined [[SMIC]] with his team, reportedly earning about $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

### Impact at [[SMIC]] and Continued Conflicts

Liang's arrival caused tension at [[SMIC]], as Tao Haijun had just been promoted to CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. The solution was to make them co-CEOs, with Tao handling legacy trailing-edge business and Liang focusing on the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. Rumors of feuding persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

*   **28nm Node**: In February 2016, [[SMIC]] unveiled its 28-nanometer process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. With Liang on board a year later, the yield improved from 60% to over 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. However, it was a business failure due to [[Taiwan]]ese foundry UMC achieving 98% yield rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.
*   **14/12nm Node**: Liang argued that [[SMIC]] wasted too much time on 28-nanometers and advocated for another multi-generational jump to 14 and 12 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. He led the company to achieve this, reaching a 95% yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, for which his salary was raised to $340,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.
*   **EUV Machine**: Liang and [[Chang Yi]] attempted to leverage their connections to purchase an EUV machine from ASML, but these efforts were blocked by the [[United States]] government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
*   **7nm Push**: Despite internal sentiment to focus on trailing-edge nodes, Liang continued pushing for the 7-nanometer node, the last achievable with older DUV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

In 2018, [[Chang Yi]] left to join the ill-fated Honxing Semiconductor Company, but later returned as vice chairman to [[SMIC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. This effectively made [[Chang Yi]] Liang's manager again, leading to a public "hissy fit" where Liang attempted to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. To retain him, [[SMIC]] gave him a $3.3 million mansion and raised his salary to $1.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. Liang remains co-CEO of [[SMIC]], continuing his pursuit of leading-edge technology amidst complaints about his direction and management style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. [[Chang Yi]] retired again in November 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

Liang Mong Song's story is seen as a teaching tale about the importance of people in the semiconductor industry, rather than just machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

Each year, the world loses 1% to 2% of its hydropower capacity due to river silt and sediment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Silting gradually diminishes a dam's ability to store drinking water, generate power, and provide flood protection, necessitating expensive preventative measures and interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Many reservoirs globally face constant concern from siltation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Understanding Reservoir Siltation

Rivers transport two primary types of sediment:
*   **Coarse Sediment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>: This includes sands and gravels, typically originating from the riverbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Fine-Grained Sediment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>: These are smaller particles, roughly two millimeters wide, that can come from the riverbed or from clay and silt washed into the river by rains or human activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The total amount of sediment carried by rivers is measured using a metric called "sediment yield," expressed in units such as tons per year per square kilometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

When a river is dammed to create a reservoir, its normal flow of sediment transport is interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. River sediments begin to settle within the reservoir, gradually filling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Eventually, the reservoir accumulates so much sediment on its bottom that its water storage capacity is significantly reduced, a situation known as reservoir sedimentation or silting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Storage lost to silting is termed "dead storage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Impacts of Siltation

Reservoir siltation has wide-ranging [[impact_of_reservoir_silting_on_hydropower_and_water_storage | impacts]], affecting water supply, energy generation, navigation, and even public health.

### Loss of Capacity and Functionality
Silting slowly erodes a dam's capacity to store drinking water, generate power, and protect from flooding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It affects every reservoir over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Regional Examples

*   **Taiwan**: Reservoirs in Taiwan are particularly vulnerable to siltation due to their [[geographical_influences_on_reservoir_siltation | geography]] and weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Taiwan's mountainous terrain and loose soils, combined with frequent typhoon storms that bring long rainstorms, sweep loose soils into rivers, dramatically increasing sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. For example, Typhoon Morakot in 2009 deposited an estimated 90 million cubic meters of sediment into Taiwan's largest reservoir, the Zengwen Dam, leading to fears of spillage and downstream damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Australia**: Australia's economy relies heavily on surface irrigation from dams and reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Before the 1970s, reservoir sedimentation was not a major concern, partly due to assumptions of low sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. However, this proved incorrect, with over 20 dams becoming fully silted between 1890 and 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Many of these older dams, some built for steam engines, are still in use for irrigation or emergency water storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Highest siltation rates occurred during large floods following significant droughts, leaving dams ill-equipped for massive influxes of muddy floodwaters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Dominican Republic**: During Hurricane David in 1979, 17 meters of sediment and debris blocked the Valdesia Dam, leading to power intake blockages for half a year, with dredging efforts continuing 28 years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Broader Consequences

Beyond capacity loss, other significant consequences of silting include:
*   **Navigation Issues**: Silted reservoirs hinder boats from carrying cargo by preventing access to dam locks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Environmental and Health Hazards**: When accumulated sediment dries up, it becomes airborne, causing dust storms and posing health risks to local residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Energy Generation Damage**: Sediment directly harms [[impact_of_reservoir_silting_on_hydropower_and_water_storage | hydropower]] dams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Coarse sediments erode turbine runner blades, abrade gate seals and spillways, and clog intake valves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Long-term Implications for Infrastructure
Historically, reservoirs were designed with a presumption of a working life, often around a hundred years, after which the dam would be presumed lost to siltation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. However, many dams are critical pieces of [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources | infrastructure]] that cannot simply be abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

> [!warning] The Need for Maintenance
> Dams may appear invincible, but like any human-built [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources | infrastructure]], they require continuous effort to maintain their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Neglecting this maintenance can lead to [[consequences_of_ignoring_reservoir_maintenance | severe consequences]], including the abandonment of once-vital water resources, as seen with the 1,800-year-old Roman-built Harbaka Dam in Syria, which became silted and abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## Causes of Sediment Yield

The single most significant cause for high sediment yields in water is upstream soil erosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Soil erosion is often exacerbated by human activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Farmers cultivating soils on sloping lands, especially when the best farmlands are already utilized, leave these areas extremely vulnerable to rain-induced erosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Mitigating Sedimentation

Strategies for dealing with reservoir siltation fall into three categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>: [[methods_for_managing_reservoir_siltation | sediment yield reduction]], [[methods_for_managing_reservoir_siltation | sediment routing]], and [[methods_for_managing_reservoir_siltation | sediment removal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Sediment Yield Reduction
This involves reducing the amount of sediment flowing into reservoirs from the source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This means either preventing soil erosion or trapping eroded sediment before it reaches the dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

Methods for soil protection include:
*   Reducing tillage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   Protecting denuded soil with mulch cover or vegetation like vetiver grass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   Terracing slopes to prevent water from washing away soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

While there are hundreds of methods, the primary challenge is the sheer size of the watershed area that needs intervention, often spanning hundreds of miles and multiple governances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Despite these challenges, hard work can pay off, as demonstrated in Australia where siltation rates declined significantly after the 1950s due to the introduction of new farming techniques and land conservation methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Another approach to reduce sediment yield is to create buffer reservoirs upstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Large dams, like the 39 major dams along the Paran√° River, including the Itaipu Dam, inadvertently serve as sediment traps for downstream hydropower projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. On a smaller scale, increased construction of farm ponds in Central Texas over the second half of the century has led to a 55% decline in watershed sediment yield, resulting in local reservoirs having twice as good a siltation rate compared to similar reservoirs in other states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Sediment Routing
Sediment routing encompasses tactics that prevent sediment from accumulating at the reservoir's bottom by moving it around or through the reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

*   **Pass-through (Sluicing)**: This prominent tactic, summarized by the Chinese slogan "discharge the muddy water, impound the clean water," involves substantial reservoir drawdown for extended periods (weeks or months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Dams must be designed with outlets capable of handling this flushing; for instance, the silted dams in Australia failed partly because their outlets were too small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Many large Chinese dams, including the Yellow River's Sanmenxia Dam, employ this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Bypass Tunnels**: These tunnels allow sediment to bypass a dam entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. They are better suited for medium-sized dams where normal pass-throughs might be less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The advantage is that they do not require flushing reservoir water levels and can allow for more natural river flow, offering ecological benefits, though their limited operational days (2-5 days/year) temper this benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Switzerland pioneered bypass tunnels in the 1970s, and Japan has also implemented them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### Sediment Removal
Despite other tactics, silt and sediment will eventually enter dams, necessitating removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Removal can occur when the reservoir is dry (dry excavation) or when it's wet (dredging) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

*   **Dry Excavation**: This invasive and costly effort involves dewatering the reservoir (which can take up to a year) and then using conventional equipment to excavate and truck the sediment slurry elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Costs vary significantly; for example, Los Angeles County's dry excavation of dams in 1993 ranged from $5 to $30 per square meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Dredging**: Commonly practiced for commercial shipping lanes, dredging can be hydraulic (mixing sediment with water and sucking it up) or mechanical (using a machine-powered clam shell or bucket) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Dredging is expensive and typically reserved for large projects, and it may not be fast enough to keep up with high sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. In Taiwan, despite $160 million spent on dredging the Zengwen Reservoir, only 8% of its capacity has been restored due to high sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Underwater Explosions**: Engineers have proposed using underwater explosions to loosen sediment deposits, making them easier to flush or dredge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. In 2018, Taiwanese civil engineers experimented with this method at the critically important Zengwen Reservoir, which provides 40% of the area's water needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Due to the high value of the water, pass-through methods are not viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The reservoir uses a de-silting tunnel and mechanical dredging for about 2 million cubic meters of sediment annually, but this only reaches 8-10 meters deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Dynamite was used in two experiments: a free-drop method creating a 20-meter-wide crater, and drilling a 15-meter-deep hole to loosen a 10-meter layer of sediment for six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Blasting, combined with other methods, was calculated to free up an additional 15% of reservoir capacity, and its continued use was recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Historical Context

Engineers have dealt with reservoir siltation since ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. For example, the Romans equipped the 1,700-year-old Monte Novo Dam with two outlets for flushing sedimented water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. However, sometimes societies lose the ability to maintain these structures, leading to abandoned silted reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. While some can be rehabilitated, others cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

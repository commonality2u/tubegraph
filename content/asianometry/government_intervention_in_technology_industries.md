Government intervention in the technology sector, particularly in the computer and semiconductor industries, has historically aimed to foster national champions and ensure technological self-sufficiency. However, as seen in the case of International Computers Limited (ICL) in the United Kingdom, such efforts often face significant challenges when competing against global giants.

## Early British Computing and Government Influence

The origins of government involvement in the British computing industry can be traced back to early 20th-century developments and wartime exigencies.

### Foundations and Early Licenses
Hermann Hollerith invented an electromechanical tabulating machine for punched cards in the 1880s for the 1890 U.S. census <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. His company, The Tabulating Machine Company (TMC), later became IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:32">[01:32:32]</a>. In 1907, Hollerith's British friends, R.P. Porter and Sir Raleigh Philpotts, licensed his technology to found the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. BTM received an exclusive license for punch card technology throughout the British Empire (except Canada) in exchange for 25% of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>. This license was later inherited by IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

During World War II, both British punch card machine firms, BTM and Power Samas, stopped investing in R&D as their facilities were turned over to the UK government for war purposes, making precision military equipment like bomber aircraft frames and gun aimers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

### Post-War Concerns and NRDC
After the war, British policymakers grew concerned about the country's ability to capitalize on its own scientific and industrial innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. In 1949, the Labour government established the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. This quasi-governmental organization aimed to secure the national development of the UK's public research and acquire rights to inventions from that research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.

Lord Halsbury, NRDC's first general manager, visited IBM in 1949 and became convinced that the British computing industry could not compete with the American giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. He attempted to persuade British businesses to enter the computing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. Several companies, including Ferranti, Elliott Brothers, and English Electric, began developing commercial computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. Ferranti's partnership with Manchester University to build a commercial computer was supported by a contract from the Ministry of Supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

## Consolidation and the Ministry of Technology (Mintec)

By 1964, the British computing industry was largely consolidated into two major players: English Electric and International Computers and Tabulators Limited (ICT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>.

### Formation of Mintec
In October 1964, the Harold Wilson government came to power and one of its first actions was to establish a Ministry of Technology (Mintec) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>. Mintec's primary focus was the British computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>. The government believed that without swift action, the British computer industry would rapidly disappear due to formidable competition from American giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>.

Concerns about America's widening technology gap were also prevalent in France. For instance, General Electric acquired a controlling share of France's largest computer manufacturer, Bull, in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>. Later, in the mid-1960s, the USA denied an export license for several American computers to prevent France from perfecting its H-bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57:00">[22:57:00]</a>. This led France to spend $100 million on its Plan Calcul to create a French national champion for computers, though it ultimately failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:00]</a>. These examples highlight the broader [[impact_of_american_sanctions_on_chinese_technology | political influence]] and [[impact_of_government_policies_and_military_demand_on_semiconductor_innovation | government policies]] on technology development.

### Forced Merger into ICL
The UK was one of the last European strongholds where IBM did not have dominant market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:38:00">[23:38:00]</a>. Mintec aimed to consolidate the industry and enable it to compete against IBM, which meant merging English Electric and ICT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>. Initial government meetings with the two companies in 1964 were met with resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:55:00">[23:55:00]</a>.

After being re-elected in 1966, the Wilson government persistently pursued its vision of a British national champion in computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>. They offered a "dowry" of up to 30 million pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>. While the firms agreed to a merger in 1967, economic worsening in 1968 led Mintec to reduce the dowry to 13.5 million pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36:00">[24:36:00]</a>. Despite this, the merger finalized in July 1968, creating ICL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>. ICL became the world's largest non-American computer manufacturer, with 100 million pounds in annual revenue and 34,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:57:00">[24:57:00]</a>.

## ICL and Subsequent Government Influence

ICL's mission was to streamline its computer range, boost R&D, and compete with IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08:00">[25:08:00]</a>.

### Political Pressure and Strategic Missteps
ICL inherited two incompatible mainframe product families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>. ICL initially wanted to phase out the technically outdated 1900 series, but political pressure from the Labour government prevented this because the System 4 was not a British-made product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>.

Political interference kept ICL focused on being a mainframe manufacturer, ironically accelerating its eventual marginalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:54:00">[25:54:00]</a>. This overemphasis on the expensive mainframe industry caused the company to completely miss the mini-computer boom of the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:04:00">[26:04:00]</a>.

### Shifting Government Stance and Financial Aid
During the 1968 computer industry recession, ICL called for [[government_subsidies_and_investments_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | government intervention]] and aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:27:00">[26:27:00]</a>. However, the election of Edward Heath's Conservative government in 1970 brought an anti-interventionist stance, merging Mintec into the Department of Trade and Industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30:00">[26:30:00]</a>.

Despite this, the UK government had to rescue Rolls-Royce in February 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:44:00">[26:44:00]</a>. This led to arguments that Heath's anti-interventionist position was inconsistent, especially as France and Germany were spending hundreds of millions in [[government_subsidies_and_investments_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | government support]] for their own computer industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:51:00">[26:51:00]</a>. ICL, facing layoffs and R&D cuts, ultimately received a 40 million pound loan from the government in 1971, which helped maintain R&D from 1972 to 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:01:00">[27:01:00]</a>.

By 1980, facing another economic recession, ICL projected significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:03:00">[30:03:00]</a>. The company approached the government for more assistance, but the newly elected Thatcher government was reluctant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>. They eventually agreed to a 200 million pound loan guarantee, but only on the condition that the management team be replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:27:00">[30:27:00]</a>. This [[government_policies_and_their_influence_on_the_nuclear_industry | government effort]] to sustain ICL, however, ended the company's hopes of being a national champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:06:00">[32:06:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: Lessons from ICL's Downfall

The downfall of ICL illustrates several common trends related to government intervention in technology industries:

*   **Lack of Technical Primacy**: The British computing industry, through ICL, constantly followed IBM and later Japanese giants, struggling to achieve business leadership in its own geographic domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:14:00">[33:14:00]</a>.
*   **Industry Splintering**: The industry did not become massive [[vertical_integration_in_the_tech_industry | vertically integrated]] combines as some predicted, like telecom. Instead, competitive intensity and market size led to splintering, with individual companies focusing on specific products like software, raising the stakes for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:25:00">[33:25:00]</a>.
*   **Hollowness of National Prestige**: ICL and its political sponsors aimed to beat IBM in its stronghold of big mainframe computers, leading to significant investment to emulate IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a>. However, this "national champion" could not match the resources of its global competitors, ultimately facing the same market shifts that led to IBM's decline in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:14:00">[34:14:00]</a>.

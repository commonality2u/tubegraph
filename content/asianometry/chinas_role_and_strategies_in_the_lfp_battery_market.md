In 2024, [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | lithium-ion battery pack prices]] decreased by 20% to $115 per kilowatt-hour, marking the largest price cut since 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This makes Chinese batteries cheaper even with significant tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Central to this trend are the price and technology developments within [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | Lithium Ion Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. LFP batteries were once considered low-end due to fundamental chemistry weaknesses, but China has engineered solutions to overcome these limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | The Three Chemistries]]

Lithium-ion batteries consist of a cathode and an anode, with the anode typically being graphite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The cathode is the most expensive component, accounting for over 70% of the battery's value, and differentiates battery types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. There are three major chemistries:
*   **Ternary Batteries:** These include Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) and Nickel Cobalt Aluminum (NCA), named for their three-material cathodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. They offer higher energy densities, allowing for lighter battery packs and longer EV ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. However, they use rarer, more expensive materials like nickel and cobalt, which constitute 70% of a battery's cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Higher energy densities also increase thermal risks, potentially leading to thermal runaway (fire) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **[[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | LFP Batteries]]:** These use a dual-chemistry cathode made from iron phosphate, containing no cobalt or nickel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Since iron and phosphorus are more common, LFPs have a substantial cost advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. They also maintain their initial energy capacity better over many charge cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Their primary drawback is lower energy density (90-160 Wh/kg compared to NCA's 230-260 Wh/kg and NMC's 250-320 Wh/kg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This translates to shorter EV ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. However, their lower energy density also reduces thermal runaway risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

In essence, [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | LFP batteries]] excel in cost and safety but lag in performance, while NMC and NCA offer performance at higher cost and with greater safety risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Battle of the Batteries

Early lithium-ion batteries, Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCOs), used significant amounts of cobalt, primarily sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This proved unsustainable economically, morally, and environmentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This led to the adoption of ternary chemistries like NCA, NMC, and Lithium Manganese Oxide (LMO), which used less cobalt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. In the 2010s, Western EV pioneers like Chevrolet, Nissan, and Tesla utilized ternary cathode chemistries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Meanwhile, [[the_rise_of_ev_companies_in_china | China's first EV makers]] adopted [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | LFP batteries]] for their new energy vehicles, especially buses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This was influenced by early government industrial policies such as the "Thousands of Vehicles, Tens of Cities" (TVTC) policy, launched in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. TVTC provided subsidies to municipal governments to purchase public service fleets, aiming to address urban air pollution, energy security, and foster [[the_rise_of_ev_companies_in_china | Chinese EV]] development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Companies like BYD became early pioneers in LFP due to cost and safety advantages, leading to LFP dominance in the Chinese EV industry for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

However, in late 2016, the Chinese government shifted its subsidy policies to encourage EVs more attractive to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Subsidies became linked to factors like higher energy density, longer driving ranges, and faster charging rates, favoring ternary battery chemistries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This led many long-time LFP adopters, including BYD, to switch to ternary batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. By mid-2019, ternary batteries reached about 70% of installed capacity, while LFP's market share fell to 30% or lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## The Subsidies Withdraw

Two major developments reversed this trend and revitalized [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | LFP batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
1.  **Withdrawal of Subsidies:** Starting in June 2019, the Chinese government began gradually withdrawing its EV cash subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. While anticipated, the aggressive sunsetting, including a 50% reduction in mid-2019, surprised the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This leveled the cost playing field, prompting EV makers to switch back to LFP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
2.  **Technological Advancements:** At the same time, [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | LFP makers]] introduced new technologies to address their fundamental weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### Blade Battery

BYD introduced the Blade battery in March 2020, which revolutionized EV battery manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Traditionally, EV batteries are assembled from cells grouped into modules, which are then integrated into packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The Blade battery skips the module level, directly integrating cells into the battery pack, a concept known as Cell-to-Pack (CTP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This compensates for [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | LFP's]] lower energy density by maximizing the pack's volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

BYD re-engineered the prismatic cell form factor into a very long, ultra-thin "blade" shape, with the metal casing spanning the width of the entire battery pack, ensuring structural integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The 2020 Han EV, featuring the Blade battery, achieved a range of 605 kilometers (NEDC), comparable to premium EVs running on ternary batteries but at a significantly lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. CTP technology allows LFP battery packs to achieve about 85% of the energy density of conventional NMC batteries, and ternary batteries have difficulty adopting CTP due to higher temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

Following BYD's success, other major [[the_rise_of_ev_companies_in_china | Chinese EV battery makers]], such as CATL, adopted their own CTP technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. As a result, [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | LFP battery]] volumes surpassed NMC in 2021, accounting for nearly 70% of EV installations by 2023 in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. NMC batteries are now primarily used for premium, high-performance cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## [[the_influence_of_patents_on_lfp_battery_development | Patents]]

Another significant factor in China's rise in [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | LFP]] was [[the_influence_of_patents_on_lfp_battery_development | patent]] access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. While Dr. John Goodenough patented the LFP cathode, its initial commercial performance was poor due to electrical conductivity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Key innovations in carbon coating and process technologies, which made LFP commercially viable, were patented by researchers in Canada and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. These patents were consolidated under a Swiss entity managing global licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

According to the IEA, a deal in the 2000s or 2010s allowed Chinese battery-makers to use these [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | LFP battery]] patents for free, but only for their local markets, while others had to pay licensing fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This "patent shield" enabled China to build expertise and proficiency in LFP, while the rest of the world hesitated due to licensing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. These patents expired in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. By then, Chinese battery makers had developed immense LFP supply chain proficiency, CTP innovations, economies of scale, materials sourcing, and talent pipelines, leaving foreign competitors massively behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Competition and Innovation

Until 2021, BYD practiced vertical integration, supplying batteries only for its own cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. However, in 2021, BYD began selling its Blade batteries to third parties like Toyota and Ford, introducing a major new Tier 1 battery supplier and triggering a price war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. This intensified the already highly competitive [[the_rise_of_ev_companies_in_china | Chinese EV market]], where a new EV model is released every two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

[[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | LFP makers]] are pursuing new production methods and chemistries to differentiate themselves. One such innovation is Lithium Manganese Iron Phosphate (LMFP), which adds manganese to achieve higher energy density than ordinary LFP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Another is the "double firing" (二烧) process flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Traditional LFP production involves a single high-temperature firing of raw precursors, which can lead to uneven grain growth and poor carbon coatings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. The dual-firing method partially fires precursors at a lower temperature, then mills and carbon coats them before a second firing, resulting in more uniform particles and better, more consistent performance ideal for long-range, fast-charging EVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## Raw Materials

A significant factor in the [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | lithium-ion battery price crash]] was a concurrent crash in raw material prices after 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Raw materials account for 70-80% of a battery cell's cost, and for [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | LFP]], 80% of that material cost is from iron phosphate and lithium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. New lithium sources coming online in Australia, Chile, and Argentina in 2023 reversed a 2022 shortage, causing lithium prices to crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Despite some mines producing losses, Chinese operators are injecting cash to keep them open for political and technical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

Iron prices also fell from their 2022 highs due to [[chinas_solar_industry_rise | China's real estate crisis]], which mothballed crude steel production, leading to a 15% drop in iron ore prices in 2024 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. These falling raw material costs allow [[the_rise_of_ev_companies_in_china | Chinese EV battery makers]] to cut battery prices while maintaining profitability, despite intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. For example, CATL's gross profit margins rose from 19.2% to 24.4% in 2024, even with declining revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

## Utility-Scale Storage

The falling [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | prices of LFP batteries]] have also impacted other industries, particularly utility-scale stationary energy storage systems (BESS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. BESS are used to store power from wind or solar during low demand, offering an arbitrage opportunity against ramping up traditional power plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. While other storage methods exist, such as pumped storage or "power to gas" (producing methane from water and captured CO2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, these are now largely uncompetitive due to the crashing costs of LFP batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

[[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | LFPs]] were already favored for BESS due to their lower material costs and resistance to thermal runaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. The [[the_rise_of_ev_companies_in_china | Chinese EV boom]] from 2021 further accelerated BESS adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. Though BESS currently offer less capacity (1-2 hours of power compared to pumped storage's 4-12 hours), they are incredibly cheap and simple to build, often housed in standard-sized containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. Billions of dollars are being invested in BESS projects across the United States, particularly in California and Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[the_rise_of_ev_companies_in_china | Chinese EV]] and stationary battery industries continue to advance, with market analysts expecting [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | LFP prices]] to continue falling, albeit at a slower pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. A forthcoming development to watch is the progress of sodium-ion battery technology, which is being pursued by companies like CATL, BYD, and Huawei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. While sodium-ion batteries currently suffer from fundamental energy density shortcomings compared to lithium-ion, sodium is far more accessible, appears to charge faster, and its energy density is improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. However, with the highly optimized [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | LFP]] supply chain, its ultimate impact remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

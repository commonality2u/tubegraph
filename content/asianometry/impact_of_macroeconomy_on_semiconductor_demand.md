The semiconductor industry is characterized by high volatility, with booms and busts occurring rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Even in normal times, conditions are unpredictable, with shipments soaring 70% one year and crashing 40% the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Macroeconomic Influence on Semiconductor Demand

Demand for semiconductors is heavily impacted by the broader macro-economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. As electronics are consumer items, consumers tend to buy fewer iPhones and laptops during tough economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Historical examples of macroeconomic downturns affecting the semiconductor business include:
*   Oil shocks in 1975, 1982, and 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   The Asian Financial Crisis of 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

#### The COVID-19 Pandemic and Economic Rebound
In March 2020, the stock market experienced a 25% downturn, with experts predicting a collapse of the world economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Companies responded by cutting expenses and hunkering down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. However, a flurry of stimulus packages and money printing led to an unexpectedly rapid economic bounce back in Q3 2020, a development few predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This rapid rebound contributed to the subsequent [[challenges_in_semiconductor_forecasting_and_supply_chain | chip shortage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

TSMC Chairman Mark Liu cited the [[impact_of_the_pandemic_on_semiconductor_supply_chains | pandemic]] and recent [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_semiconductor_industry | China-America trade tensions]] as major reasons for customers double-booking orders, making the shortage appear worse than it was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The trade tensions are considered a bigger, ongoing concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

#### Demand vs. Supply Surges in Downturns
While macroeconomic factors influence demand, a 2005 study found that semiconductor down cycles are triggered more significantly by surges in semiconductor inventory levels and fab capacity, rather than a decrease in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This suggests that oversupply, rather than under-demand, is often the primary cause of downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

Enver Hoxha, the long-serving leader of [[Economic policies and challenges under Communist rule | Communist Albania]], was born the son of a Muslim clothing merchant and grew up in an ordinary family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. He was a hardworking student, though without any obvious talents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. With the help of an ambitious uncle, he gained admission to the prestigious Albanian National Lyceum in Korca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. At school, he was an average student, but displayed a notable talent for politics and a strong desire for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. He was also easily underestimated, a trait that contributed to his future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. After graduation, he attended university in France but did not complete his studies, later working as a teacher in Albania after a period in Brussels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. He became a Communist at some point before his teaching career, though the exact timing is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Rise to Power

Hoxha was present at the founding of the Communist Party of Albania in 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, which was initiated by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia to unify scattered Albanian communist groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Initially, the various group leaders refused to accept a single leader, leading to the formation of a Central Committee designed for collective leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Hoxha was selected for this committee and quickly dominated it, eventually seeing the rest of his peers either jailed or executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

During World War II, the Communist Party of Albania, also known as the Albanian Party of Labor, formed the National Liberation Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Following the advice of the Yugoslavs, they strategically abandoned the economic messaging of Marxist-Leninism in favor of preaching national liberation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. They launched guerrilla attacks against the Italian occupiers, intentionally courting violent reprisals to radicalize more people and bolster their ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. A secret agreement in August 1943 to unify with the National Front (Nationalists) quickly dissolved due to disagreements, particularly over the fight for an ethnic Albanian country that would include Kosovo, which was part of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This led to violence, with the Communists attacking the Nationalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. When the Nationalists subsequently allied with Germany, it discredited them in the eyes of the Albanian people, paving the way for the Communists' victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. In November 1944, the Communists marched into Tirana, winning the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Consolidation of Power and Leadership Style

Upon securing power, Hoxha's provisional government immediately began purging opponents rather than focusing on rebuilding the war-torn country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Koci Xoxe, the Minister of the Interior, led a brutal purge targeting elites, anti-communists, and "enemies of the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Sham tribunals led to nearly 2,000 executions and the imprisonment of others in 39 newly built jails, where they were forced into labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The regime established the Directorate of State Security (Sigurimi), a secret police force that, at its peak, employed over 200,000 workers and kept millions of files on citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

In December 1945, "free" elections were held, with the Communists being the only candidates, winning 90% of the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. A month later, Hoxha abolished the monarchy and declared Albania a "People's Republic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### Purges and Political Maneuvering

Initially, Albania was heavily influenced by Yugoslavia, which provided military and economic assistance with the expectation that Albania would join the Yugoslav Federation under Josip Tito <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Yugoslavia exploited Albanian resources and sought to replace Hoxha with Koci Xoxe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. However, Stalin's growing animosity towards Tito provided Hoxha with an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. In a secret meeting in June 1947, the Soviets guaranteed protection against a Yugoslav attack and gave Hoxha free rein to purge pro-Yugoslav influence from the party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

This intervention saved Hoxha, leading to the swift downfall and execution of Koci Xoxe in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Xoxe, who had overseen many sham trials, was condemned in one of his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. His final wish for his family to be spared persecution and his son allowed to pursue education was ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Such "liquidations" continued throughout Hoxha's 46-year rule, with 5,037 men and 450 women executed under his tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

### Economic and Foreign Policy Direction

After 1948, Albania severed ties with Yugoslavia and entered the Soviet orbit, becoming part of COMECON <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Hoxha demonstrated immense personal admiration for Stalin, publishing a book about their meetings, portraying the Soviet leader as warm and kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. This admiration translated into a fervent commitment to a Stalinist economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, characterized by [[Economic policies and challenges under Communist rule | central planning]], [[Economic policies and challenges under Communist rule | collectivization of agriculture]], and rapid build-up of heavy industry at the expense of consumer products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. The first 5-Year Plan in 1951 set all prices, production levels, investment, and wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

After Stalin's death in 1953, Hoxha publicly mourned him, forcing thousands to swear an eternal oath to their "beloved father" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. However, he quickly clashed with Nikita Khrushchev's new policies, particularly the repudiation of Stalin's cult of personality, the instituting of collective leadership, and the reconciliation with Marshal Tito <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

By October 1954, Albania began aligning with China, the other major Communist power at odds with Khrushchev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. This alignment escalated into the [[Albanias relationships with major communist powers | Sino-Soviet Split]], with Hoxha criticizing Khrushchev in Moscow in November 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. The Soviets retaliated by withdrawing significant aid, which constituted 50% of Albania's economy between 1946 and 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. Khrushchev publicly denounced Hoxha as an "unreconstructed Stalinist" and accused him of sabotaging relations to gain imperialist handouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

Hoxha fiercely retorted, calling Khrushchev a "revisionist" and "anti-Marxist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. In a famous speech, he declared, "The Albanian people and their Party of Labor will even live on grass if need be, but they will never sell themselves 'for 30 pieces of silver'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This led to Albania's expulsion from the Warsaw Pact and COMECON, leaving China as its sole significant ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

### Extreme Isolation and Cult of Personality

Despite Mao Zedong's assurances of support, [[Deng Xiaopings leadership and its influence on Chinese foreign policy | Chinese aid]] was insufficient to replace Soviet losses due to China's own developmental struggles and geographical distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. To maintain his grip on power, Hoxha intensified the Sigurimi's surveillance and ramped up his own cult of personality, meticulously controlling his public image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

The "love affair" with China ended when China began overtures to the West, culminating in US President Nixon's trip to China in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. This news was a "bombshell" for Albania, which valued its position as China's only "real" ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. Hoxha formally criticized the meeting and purged pro-Chinese members of his army and Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. After Mao's death and a meeting between [[Deng Xiaopings leadership and its influence on Chinese foreign policy | Deng Xiaoping]] and Tito, Albania ramped up rhetorical attacks on China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. In July 1978, China cut off all aid, which then constituted half of Albania's economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

This final break pushed Albania into extreme [[The isolation and selfreliance of Communist Albania | self-reliance]] (often referred to as [[The isolation and selfreliance of Communist Albania | "Hoxhaism"]]), a principle enshrined in the 1976 Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. For the next 12 years, the country operated without foreign aid or credit, banning joint ventures with foreign companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. Hoxha was granted unlimited power, and his cult of personality reached unprecedented levels, labeling him the "father of the nation" and a "second Skenderbeu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. Religion was banned, and citizens were forbidden from traveling abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

### Final Years and Succession

Hoxha, a longtime smoker and diabetic, suffered heart attacks in 1972 and 1973, which reduced his political activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. In 1980, he chose Ramiz Alia as his successor, purging and possibly executing his long-time partner, Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu, in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. Alia gradually gained power as Hoxha receded into a "lonely semi-retirement," largely maintaining the party line of economic isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.

In his final years, Hoxha became frail and largely unaware of the developing economic disaster, spending his time writing 13 memoirs romanticizing his achievements and youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. He died in April 1985 after collapsing into a coma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. His Party's grip on power would not survive much longer as the country entered a deep economic stagnation and decay, paving the way for [[The decline and fall of Communist Albania | the eventual fall of communism in Albania]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

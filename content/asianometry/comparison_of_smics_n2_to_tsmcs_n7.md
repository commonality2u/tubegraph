Recently, news broke that China's semiconductor champion, SMIC, has begun producing chips using their [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | N+2 process node]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This development, which represents a [[7nanometer_chip_production_and_technological_significance | 7-nanometer Leap Forward]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, has garnered significant attention in the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Understanding Process Nodes

Process node numbers, such as [[7nanometer_chip_production_and_technological_significance | 7-nanometer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, are primarily marketing terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. They aim to convey improvements in a chip's power, performance, or area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, rather than corresponding to a specific physical dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. For example, a "7-nanometer" chip is generally about 70% better than the previous generation's 10-nanometer chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. To avoid controversy, [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | TSMC]] refers to its 7-nanometer node as N7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## SMIC's N+2 Node: A Close Comparison to TSMC's N7

SMIC's [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | N+2 node]] is a refinement of its N+1 process, which was first taped out in October 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Both nodes utilize DUV immersion lithography with multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, a technique foundries used extensively before [[tsmc_n2_process_node_and_new_fabs | EUV technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> became widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Although [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC's N+2]] is capable of using [[tsmc_n2_process_node_and_new_fabs | EUV technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, the United States has imposed an export ban on such devices from [[comparison_between_smee_and_asml | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, blocking this part of SMIC's roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Industry analysis indicates that [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC's N+2]] is highly similar to [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | TSMC's]] N7, reportedly 99% the same in terms of physical measurements of transistors and finFET placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | TSMC]] first shipped N7 chips in high volume in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This suggests that a high-volume equivalent node from [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] would place them approximately four to six years behind the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Economic Viability and Market Challenges

While [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC's N+2]] is one of the most advanced processes available from any foundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, its [[economic_viability_of_smics_chip_production | economic competitiveness]] without [[tsmc_n2_process_node_and_new_fabs | EUV technology]] is debatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. It is technically possible to fabricate chips at nodes more advanced than N7 using 193-nanometer immersion technology and multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Dr. Burn Lin, a former [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | TSMC]] R&D director, even suggested that [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] could fabricate N5-equivalent chips with only multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

However, the key challenge lies in achieving meaningful quantities and yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. [[competition_between_tsmc_and_samsung | Samsung]] has struggled with yields on advanced process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, and [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Intel]] famously faced difficulties transitioning from their 10-nanometer to 7-nanometer equivalent nodes without [[tsmc_n2_process_node_and_new_fabs | EUV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. In contrast, [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | TSMC]] ramped up N7 without significant reported issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Given the similarity between [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | N+2]] and [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | TSMC's]] N7, [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] is expected to follow a similar yield optimization curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Despite this, the market has changed significantly since 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Foundries with [[tsmc_n2_process_node_and_new_fabs | EUV]] possess economic advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, and an N7-equivalent node relying solely on multi-patterning has manufacturing limitations that restrict chip designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. In an open market, [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC's N+2]] would likely not be [[economic_viability_of_smics_chip_production | economically viable]] due to the superior performance of [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | TSMC's]] N6, an [[tsmc_n2_process_node_and_new_fabs | EUV]]-equipped evolution of their N7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Trade Secrets and Domestic Focus

The close similarity between [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC's N+2]] and [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | TSMC's]] N7 raises concerns about potential trade secret infringement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | TSMC]] successfully obtained product import bans on [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] products in the US in 2002 and 2006 due to trade secret violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. If successful again, such a ban would likely limit [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | N+2]] to domestic Chinese products or exports to friendly countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

While [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] values export capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, they may no longer depend on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The Chinese chip design industry has matured significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. [[huawei_and_smics_semiconductor_collabora | HiSilicon]], [[huawei_and_smics_semiconductor_collabora | Huawei's]] chip design arm, would likely be eager to use [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | N+2]] for mobile processors and server chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. [[huawei_and_smics_semiconductor_collabora | HiSilicon]] was a flagship customer of [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | TSMC]], fabricating chips like the Kirin 980 series on N7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This partnership between [[huawei_and_smics_semiconductor_collabora | HiSilicon]] and [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] could provide the massive production volumes necessary for foundries to scale and optimize their process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## The Driving Force: Liang Mong-song

China has long prioritized leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. A key factor in [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC's]] recent progress is co-CEO Liang Mong-song, a [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | TSMC]] alumnus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Known for his technical brilliance and relentless pursuit of the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, Liang joined [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] in 2017 after leaving [[competition_between_tsmc_and_samsung | Samsung]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. He brought with him a 200-person R&D team and reoriented the company towards leading-edge development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. As long as Liang remains at [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]], the company is expected to continue its push towards advanced nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## Export Controls and Future Outlook

Access to the latest lithography technologies is crucial for [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC's]] advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The [[us_technology_transfer_concerns_with_tsmc | United States]] has been pushing the Netherlands ([[comparison_between_smee_and_asml | ASML]]) and Japan (Nikon) to prevent the export of their immersion DUV lithography machines to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. While [[us_technology_transfer_concerns_with_tsmc | the US]] has long blocked the sale of the newest [[tsmc_n2_process_node_and_new_fabs | EUV]] machines to China, expanding the block to immersion lithography represents a significant escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

Immersion machines use fluids to improve the resolution of older 193-nanometer ARF laser technology, serving as workhorses in modern semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. The only two current suppliers are [[comparison_between_smee_and_asml | ASML]] and Nikon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Modifying dry ARF machines into immersion lithography machines is technically possible, but it is a substantial effort that would take less than five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:10:00]</a>. An [[7nanometer_chip_production_and_technological_significance | N7]] equivalent node would require more sophisticated immersion technologies, extending the timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

An export ban on 193-nanometer immersion lithography, without a corresponding ban on dry ARF technology, could add four to six years to [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC's]] march toward the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. However, such a ban would also likely stimulate substantial investment in Chinese-made lithography equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. While the ability of Chinese companies to ship complete systems on par with [[comparison_between_smee_and_asml | ASML]] or Nikon is debatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, nothing is insurmountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

A legitimate [[7nanometer_chip_production_and_technological_significance | 7-nanometer node]] at high volume and good yield is a significant triumph for China's advanced manufacturing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, as only three other companies have reached this level of scale and sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. While an immersion ban might maintain or slightly expand the Sino-American semiconductor gap, it would not be a permanently damaging blow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. The [[us_technology_transfer_concerns_with_tsmc | United States]] values the time bought by such measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, and American semiconductor companies must use this time to build new markets, improve manufacturing, and innovate, rather than solely relying on government intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

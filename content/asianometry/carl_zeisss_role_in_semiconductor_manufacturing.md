Carl Zeiss AG, a Germany-based company, is a significant entity, particularly for its contributions to optics systems used in advanced manufacturing [00:00:00]. When etching patterns as wide as a small virus, the systems employed are no longer simple lenses but advanced optics systems [00:00:10]. These massive, multi-component systems are central to the multi-million dollar photolithography machines manufactured by [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] [00:00:19]. Without these optics, [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] would not have machines for companies like TSMC, Samsung, or Intel [00:00:26]. Carl Zeiss is one of [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]]'s closest partners, providing the optics systems that enable high-energy UV light to etch wafers [00:00:38].

## Company History and Structure

Founded in 1846 by Carl Zeiss, a German scientific instrument maker, the company began as a microscope workshop [00:01:17]. It repaired university equipment, made microscopes, and sold scientific instruments [00:01:38]. The workshop thrived and expanded [00:01:45]. In 1866, Zeiss recruited Ernst Abbe, a physicist whose insights on light rays through microscope lenses helped the company move beyond trial-and-error manufacturing [00:01:52].

After Carl Zeiss's death in 1888, Ernst Abbe took over the company [00:02:08]. He transferred his ownership to what is now known as the [[carl_zeisss_unique_ownership_structure_and_social_impact | Carl Zeiss Foundation]] [00:03:00]. Abbe integrated social reforms into the foundation's guidelines, including health insurance, pensions, profit sharing, equality in hiring, overtime pay, and nine-hour workdays [00:03:10]. The foundation operates without owners or shareholders, aiming to ensure the company's continued existence and allow employees to share in its economic success [00:03:22]. It optimizes for long-term economic success, with excess profit invested back into the working population of Jena [00:03:36]. This structure makes it more akin to a cooperative than a charity [00:03:46].

### Post-War Division and Reunification

At the end of World War II, the United States Army occupied Jena in 1945 but soon withdrew as the city fell into the Soviet zone of influence [00:04:12]. As part of a policy to secure German scientists, 130 of Zeiss's top technicians and executives were relocated to Oberkochen in West Germany [00:04:24]. In 1947, the Soviet army shipped 94% of Zeiss's Jena-based equipment and 300 employees to the Soviet Union as war booty, which later helped establish the Kiev camera brand [00:04:51]. This led to two separate entities: Zeiss in West Germany (initially Opton, then Zeiss Oberkochen) and Zeiss in East Germany (Zeiss Jena or VEB Carl Zeiss Jena) [00:05:06].

These two companies operated separately for decades, offering similar products and disputing trademarks [00:05:22]. After 18 years, they eventually agreed to split the world, not using the "Zeiss" trademark in each other's half [00:05:31]. Both companies started with nothing but flourished under their respective socialist and capitalist regimes [00:05:54]. [[economic_impact_of_semiconductor_production_on_east_germany | Zeiss Jena]], in particular, became an East German flagship company, diversifying into new areas such as military technology, space technology, and semiconductors [00:06:06].

With German reunification, [[economic_impact_of_semiconductor_production_on_east_germany | Zeiss Jena]] faced significant [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | economic challenges]], including overlap with its Western counterpart and the loss of the Soviet military market [00:06:17]. Reunification was a turbulent time, with East German industrial output falling by 51% and three million East Germans losing jobs [00:06:33]. After years of negotiation, the West German Zeiss acquired the traditional Zeiss company parts (microscopes, medical instruments) and the name [00:06:54]. The remaining 6,800-employee diversified firm, renamed Genoptics, focused on semiconductors, laser optics, and automation [00:07:07]. The German government intervened, buying 80% of its assets and saving thousands of jobs [00:07:20]. Genoptics conducted a successful IPO in 1998 [00:07:28].

## Carl Zeiss SMT: The Semiconductor Division

Today, Carl Zeiss AG is a vast company with four segments: industrial quality and research, medical technology, consumer markets, and semiconductor manufacturing [00:07:36]. Their semiconductor manufacturing division, Carl Zeiss SMT, is crucial [00:08:21]. A large portion of the world's microchips are made using Zeiss technologies [00:08:28]. Carl Zeiss SMT is a joint venture, with Carl Zeiss AG holding the majority share and [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] holding a 24.9% stake [00:08:31]. The core product of this division is the optics at the heart of the lithography scanners and steppers that [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] makes [00:08:43].

Carl Zeiss is a significant investor in research and development (R&D), spending 812 million euros in 2020, which accounted for 13% of its total revenue [00:08:05].

### Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) Lithography Optics

DUV lithography utilizes ultraviolet light rays in the 193 nanometer or 248 nanometer range and powers the majority of process nodes today [00:08:54]. Zeiss has been developing deep ultraviolet imaging systems for nearly 100 years [00:09:07]. Ernst Abbe himself proposed the possibility of a microscope using ultraviolet light as early as 1874 [00:09:12]. By 1899, the company developed a quartz lens suitable for UV microscopes [00:09:22].

In the 1960s, Zeiss leveraged its microscope expertise to create lenses for microlithography, a first for the industry [00:09:29]. Microlithography demands tight control over light distortions across a relatively large space to prevent inaccurate transfer of IC designs onto silicon [00:09:40]. A single lens proved insufficient, so Zeiss combined multiple smaller lenses to form large, complex optics systems [00:09:52]. The "double bulge" and "waist" structure in these systems helps reduce field curvature, a common optical problem that prevents an entire image from being in sharp focus simultaneously [00:10:02]. In lithography, this means inaccuracies can occur in areas of the frame that are not sufficiently sharp [00:10:21].

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Zeiss adapted its microscope techniques to increase the resolution of IC design projection onto wafers [00:10:35]. A major breakthrough came in the 2000s with immersion lithography, which replaced the air gap between the wafer and the stepper with water [00:10:50]. This technique, first proposed by Taiwanese scientist Burn Lin for semiconductor use, allowed foundries to etch structures as small as 40 nanometers [00:11:11]. Today, Zeiss's leading products for this technique are the Starlith 1900 series, including the 1900i, which are among the company's best-selling products [00:11:21]. The company invested over 450 million euros in a new factory and overcame substantial engineering [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenges]] to build these optics systems [00:11:33].

### Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography Optics

Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is the next evolution in the semiconductor fabrication roadmap and a disruptive technology used in today's cutting-edge process nodes [00:11:48]. The use of a brand new wavelength necessitates radical changes to the optics system [00:11:58]. A key [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenge]] is that all available materials, including air, absorb high-energy UV light, making traditional lenses impossible [00:12:05]. Consequently, Zeiss had to develop an optics system entirely composed of multi-layer mirrors [00:12:18].

Zeiss began work on its EUV optics system in 1995 with a micro exposure tool, a smaller version of the final product [00:12:25]. Collaborating with Lawrence Livermore National Lab and Berkeley Lab, they delivered the first prototype in 2003 [00:12:37]. The design was refined five times over the next few years [00:12:47]. In 2015, the first full-field EUV optic system, the Starlith 3100, was delivered to [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] for integration into their ASML ADT (Alpha Demo Tool) nxe 3100 [00:12:51].

The Starlith is a multi-component system comprising collector optics, aperture illumination optics, a reticle, and projection optics [00:13:17]. EUV light from the source first hits the collector, which gathers and projects the light through an aperture into the illuminator [00:13:26]. The illuminator then evenly spreads the light [00:13:36]. This uniformly illuminated light reflects off the reticle, which holds the IC chip designs, and is finally projected onto the wafer [00:13:42]. The 3100 pioneered the core mechanics of the optical system, which were later refined in subsequent releases like the Starlith 3300 and 3400 [00:13:51]. Today, these systems are a critical part of EUV-based process nodes at 7 nanometers or lower [00:14:00].

## Strategic Importance

In 2020, Zeiss's semiconductor division generated 1.8 billion euros in revenue, growing 12% year-over-year while other divisions saw declines due to the pandemic [00:14:23]. This division now accounts for 30% of the group's business and holds critical strategic importance in German industry [00:14:35].

Carl Zeiss is virtually unique in its role as a critical strategic partner alongside [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] [00:14:48]. Competitors like Japan-based Nikon and Canon, who produce their own optics systems for their lithography devices, have not achieved the same level of success as the [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | ASML-Zeiss partnership]] [00:14:55]. The complexity of Zeiss's DUV and EUV optics systems is described as fantastically complicated, making it difficult for competitors to catch up [00:15:13].

Australia is the world's leading exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), having shipped $25 billion worth of natural gas to Asian markets in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Despite its significant export capacity, Australia occasionally faces [[challenges_of_domestic_natural_gas_shortages_in_australia | domestic natural gas shortages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This paradox highlights the country's vast size, abundant resources, and complex energy politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Australia's Natural Gas Reserves
Australia possesses significant proven natural gas reserves, estimated at about 3 trillion cubic meters in conventional fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. When unconventional gas fields like coal seam gas and shale gas are included, the total could be as high as 12 trillion cubic meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. However, much of this gas is unevenly distributed, with nearly 80 percent of conventional resources concentrated in the country's northwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Early Energy Landscape
Historically, Australia focused on exporting coal, reserving natural gas for domestic use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Australians have been mining coal since the 1800s and began exporting it after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, becoming the world's second-largest coal exporter by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. When Australia's first commercial gas field came online in the 1960s, natural gas was recognized as a premium fuel due to its low pollutant characteristics compared to coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. It began to be used for electricity generation and industrial purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Understanding Natural Gas
Natural gas is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons and non-hydrocarbons, primarily methane, but also containing hexane, ethane, propane, butane, and hydrogen sulfide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It is odorless, colorless, and lighter than air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Scientists believe it originates from organic matter trapped within sediment deposits over many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

Geologists classify natural gas fields into two main categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>:
*   **Conventional Gas** describes free gas trapped in porous reservoir rocks such as carbonates, sandstones, and salt stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Unconventional Gas** is an umbrella term covering all other forms, generally found while searching for other fossil fuels and more difficult to extract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This includes [[Challenges of domestic natural gas shortages in Australia#Coal Seam Gas | shale gas]], trapped in tiny pores within shale rock, and [[Challenges of domestic natural gas shortages in Australia#Coal Seam Gas | coal seam gas]], absorbed and trapped in coal deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Challenges of Gas Transportation
One major challenge with natural gas is its [[transportation_and_infrastructure_issues_related_to_natural_gas_in_australia | transportation difficulties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Reserves are often located far from population centers where they are consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

*   **Pipelines**: Pipelines have been used for nearly a century, offering convenience and economy for shorter distances, but they lack flexibility and their construction can be politically controversial, especially for intercontinental routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)**: For longer distances (beyond 700 miles overseas or 2,200 miles on land), LNG becomes more economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. When natural gas is cooled to -260°F (-162°C), it condenses into a liquid, reducing its volume to 1/600th of its gaseous state, making it much easier to transport in tanker ships or trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The main drawback of LNG is the significant upfront cost of building expensive liquefaction plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Australia's Pipeline System
Australia, a very large country, lacks an integrated nationwide gas pipeline system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Its 47,000-kilometer network is a patchwork of three largely separate subsystems: the northern, western, and eastern markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Each market relies on its local gas fields and separate pipeline systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This disjointed system, a result of physical distance and varying regulatory regimes, contributes to a significant [[transportation_and_infrastructure_issues_related_to_natural_gas_in_australia | national energy security problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, making it difficult to transport gas from areas of abundance to areas of need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## The 1970s Export Ban and Economic Nationalism
In the 1960s and 1970s, new gas field discoveries, particularly one in central Australia, attracted foreign interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This sparked economic nationalism, leading Australia's right-leaning federal government to impose a general export embargo on LNG in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The aim was to prioritize Australia's domestic requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## The Northwest Shelf Venture
The *Northwest Shelf Venture* began as a joint undertaking between Australian companies like Woodside Petroleum and Mid-Eastern Oil, and foreign multinationals including Burma Oil, Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, and California Asiatic Oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. In the mid-1960s, they received a license to explore northwest Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. After years of little success, natural gas was discovered at Scott Reef in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Further large discoveries were made at North Rankin and Goodwin, approximately 80 miles off Dampier, estimated to hold over 300 billion cubic meters of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

These discoveries provided more than enough gas for the Western Australian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The joint venture planned a massive $12 billion project to develop these resources, build an LNG plant, and begin exporting LNG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

However, the nationwide natural gas export ban remained in effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The left-wing federal government at the time was wary of foreign multinational involvement and requested at least 50% local ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Natural gas projects are capital-intensive, and Woodside, the primary operator, needed foreign funds and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The Western Australian market alone was too small to justify the billions needed for the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Distant eastern markets were not a viable option due to the lack of an integrated pipeline system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>; the distance from Dampier to Sydney is approximately 3,202 miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The Whitlam federal government proposed building a national pipeline grid and took over an ongoing pipeline project from Moomba to Sydney in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This project faced significant political and environmental challenges, taking three years to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Shifting Political Tides and Export Approval
In 1975, a more right-leaning and business-friendly government came to power, eager to advance energy projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Obstacles began to fall away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. The local ownership threshold was eventually met naturally when Burma Oil sold its stake to the Australian mining giant BHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

In 1977, the federal government lifted its export embargo, allowing the Northwest Shelf Venture to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. They stated that exports would be permitted only after domestic requirements were considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Initially, the venture was allowed to export 50% of its gas production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Western Australia welcomed the project, which would supply Perth as the Donga field declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Eastern states, however, were disheartened, having hoped for a national pipeline project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. The new government also offered tax benefits, including an extended investment allowance, an income tax rebate, and waived certain oil and resource taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

In 1978, the venture secured deals with eight Japanese customers to supply LNG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Buoyed by favorable oil market conditions, construction began in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Growth of Northwest Shelf Project
The Northwest Shelf Venture was Australia's largest project at the time, and briefly the world's single biggest engineering project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Built in two phases, it included:
*   Offshore platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>
*   Undersea gas pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>
*   A massive LNG plant capable of processing 12 million tons of natural gas annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>
*   LNG tankers valued at $800 million AUD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>
*   A pipeline from Dampier to Perth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>

While the LNG tankers were built abroad, over 75% of the other materials were locally sourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The first LNG exports to Japan began in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Japan has remained a consistent customer, later joined by the People's Republic of China, with the two countries together purchasing 75% of Australia's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

Today, the gas fields of Western Australia still account for about 80% of the country's proven reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Over $25 billion has been invested in the project, including the massive Gorgon Gas Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. The Northwest Shelf project is legally required to reserve a significant portion of its production for domestic use, with natural gas meeting 64% of Western Australia's energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Domestic Market Challenges and Unconventional Gas
Australia's northern and eastern markets face greater supply challenges, particularly the eastern market, which includes major cities like Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Hobart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Australian energy demand is growing rapidly, with consumption increasing by approximately 0.6% annually, driven by industrial demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Despite being the 55th largest country by population, Australia ranks 19th globally in electricity consumption per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

Australia's energy mix has seen a shift towards renewables, with wind and solar energy contributions surging from 2% in 2010 to 18% in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Renewables have primarily taken market share from coal, which fell from 81% to 67% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

The size and rapid growth of the Australian energy market spurred new developments in unconventional natural gas, especially [[Challenges of domestic natural gas shortages in Australia#Coal Seam Gas | coal seam gas]] (CSG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. While the southern and eastern regions lack conventional gas fields, they have abundant coal deposits containing large amounts of methane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Historically, this methane, a workplace hazard, was vented into the atmosphere, contributing to pollution as methane has a global warming potential 21 times higher than carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

## Coal Seam Gas Boom in Eastern Australia
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, companies like Conoco Australia, Mitsubishi, and Houston Oil and Minerals attempted to harness this methane for commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. In 1996, BHP achieved a breakthrough at the Bowen Basin in Queensland, initiating a [[Challenges of domestic natural gas shortages in Australia#Coal Seam Gas | coal seam gas boom]] in eastern Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Gas production grew ninefold due to domestic eastern market growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. State governments further encouraged this by pushing for a switch from coal to gas, exemplified by the Queensland Gas Scheme in 2005, which mandated electricity retailers to produce 13-15% of their electricity from gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

The Bowen Basin holds one of the world's largest deposits of coal, with CSG reserves potentially serving the eastern markets for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. However, [[impact_of_international_markets_on_australias_natural_gas_production | export markets]] once again became a focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. The Queensland state government approved three consortia to build LNG plants and export CSG to Asian markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. The first plant, operated by Santos, came online in December 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, followed by APLNG in January 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Today, three LNG plants on Curtis Island collectively produce 26 million tons of LNG annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This new capacity leveraged existing energy export infrastructure, and Eastern Australia's proximity to Asia offered a price advantage despite higher labor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

## Australia's Global Position and Future Challenges
In 2020, [[australias_role_as_a_leading_lng_exporter | Australia dethroned Qatar]] as the world's leading exporter of liquefied natural gas, with the two countries remaining competitive for the top spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Australia's rise as a natural gas export power, combined with its reputation as a reliably Western-aligned country, has significantly contributed to stabilizing energy markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

Despite this global success, Australia's domestic markets continue to face [[challenges_of_domestic_natural_gas_shortages_in_australia | significant energy shortages]] and rising prices, impeding growth and causing political challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Various solutions have been proposed, including a transcontinental pipeline and a nationwide gas reservation policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. However, a comprehensive, coherent nationwide strategy is needed to address Australia's natural gas dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

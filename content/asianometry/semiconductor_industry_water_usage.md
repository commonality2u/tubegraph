The semiconductor industry faces significant challenges regarding its water consumption and management, especially in regions experiencing droughts and water scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This issue is projected to worsen over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## High Water Demand in Manufacturing
While residential water saving is important, water usage in agricultural and industrial sectors far exceeds home use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. [[Challenges in the semiconductor industry | Semiconductor manufacturing]], in particular, consumes a substantial amount of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

A significant portion of this water is used for washing wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Approximately 30% to 40% of the steps in modern wafer fabrication involve some form of wafer cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For example, in "wet cleaning," sequential wash steps remove organics, metals, and particles from the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Between each washing step, water is used to rinse off chemicals from the previous steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### The Need for [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Ultra Pure Water]]
Semiconductor companies cannot use regular tap water to wash wafers due to the presence of particles that could damage the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Instead, they must use [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] (UPW), an industry term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. While [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | UPW]] is used in other applications like nuclear energy or chemical manufacturing, the cleanliness standards in the semiconductor industry are stricter than almost all others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The industry aims to remove "killer particles" â€“ particles large enough to affect a chip's nano-architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. These can include microorganism waste, organic particles, dissolved metals, and gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Generating and verifying the purity of [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] is a complex process, involving over a dozen steps, many of which are repeated over multiple loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

To create 3,800 liters (1,000 gallons) of [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]], approximately 6,000 liters (1,600 gallons) of city water are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. A single 200-millimeter (8-inch) wafer can consume over 5,600 liters (2,000 gallons) of [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Impact of Circuit Complexity on Water Usage
The type of circuits manufactured also influences water usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Wafers are made in layers, and each layer needs washing and cleaning before the next can be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Logic circuits, like microprocessors, are more complex and have more layers than memory ICs, display panels, or solar panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Consequently, their manufacturing demands more water and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

In 2020, TSMC reported they did not meet their water consumption goals, achieving only a 5% reduction in liters of water consumed per 8-inch wafer equivalent layer, falling short of their 27% target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This shortfall is attributed to increased demands for process cleanliness: more advanced process nodes require more layers to wash, more [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]], and more stringent purity standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. With each new process node, the threshold for a "killer particle" shrinks, making it harder to scrub out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Cutting-edge chips today consume more water to fabricate than those from 10 years ago, despite advancements in water reuse and conservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This trend is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## [[wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | Wastewater Treatment]]
Semiconductor manufacturing processes also generate a substantial amount of [[wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | wastewater]], much of which requires treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. In 2013, TSMC's fabs in Tainan produced 19 million tons of [[wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | wastewater]], compared to the entire city's 29 million tons for the same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

Wastewater from wet washing contains high levels of pollutants like ammonia, phosphate, and fluoride, and exposure to these chemicals has been linked to health concerns for workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Different types of [[wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | wastewater]] require varying levels of treatment; some treatments, like ultraviolet light for disinfection, are relatively cheap, while others, such as reverse electrodialysis, are substantially more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Large foundries manage this by separating wastewater streams and applying specific treatments to address over 25 different chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Some of the treated water can be reused, re-entering the system to generate more [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Non-reusable water is often directed to cooling towers where it evaporates to help maintain fab temperatures, a significant energy and water consumer after direct manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

Implementing such a water management system is complex and expensive. Smaller companies often find it more cost-effective to broadly treat aggregated water and return it to the city once it meets minimum health and safety requirements, then obtain new raw water from the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Large fabs like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel must implement extensive water reuse and recycling technologies due to their scale; without them, they would quickly deplete water resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. For instance, TSMC's recycle rate in 2017 was 87%, significantly higher than the average semiconductor fab's 42% found in another 2017 study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## Case Studies: Water Stress and Mitigation
### Taiwan
Taiwan is experiencing one of its worst droughts in years, with southern areas like Tainan, Kaohsiung, Taitung, and Hsinchu facing water supply issues due to less resilient infrastructure or greater water demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Media reports indicate TSMC budgeted millions of dollars to truck water to its fabs in Tainan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

In 2019, TSMC fabs in Tainan alone consumed 50,000 metric tons (50 million liters) of water daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The area relies on the Nan Hua and Zengwen reservoirs, which are currently at dangerously low capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Taiwan's south is also its agricultural heart, requiring water for food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

To prevent draining local water supplies, TSMC's fabs have optimized their water draw and usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Beyond recycling, the company built a large rain collection system to capture and store rainwater in 700-ton tanks, which can then be processed for landscaping or sent to sewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The company has also signed tenders to construct water reclamation plants near its fabs, using technologies like reverse osmosis, hollow fiber ultrafiltration, and sand filtration to recycle industrial wastewater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. These procedures are similar to Singapore's "New Water" initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. The first facilities are in Tainan Science Park, with more reclaimed water capacity expected from future plants in the Yeongkang and Anping areas of Tainan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### Arizona
Despite being largely desert, Arizona is a location where companies like TSMC and Intel are building fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Currently, 40% of Arizona's total water demand is met by non-renewable groundwater, 57% by the Colorado River and other surface water sources, and the rest by reclaimed water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This reliance on groundwater to cover shortfalls is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Arizona's state government has generally controlled water usage by transferring water from farms to cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Agriculture consumes the vast majority of water in the American Southwest, almost 90% of total demand in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Turning farmland into cities and suburbs over the years has helped curb overall water usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. However, coordinated plans for water demand have been unsuccessful, and groundwater pumping continues to be a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

#### [[economic_impacts_of_semiconductor_facilities_on_water_resources | Economic Rationale for Fabs in Arid Regions]]
There are two main reasons why a government might consider placing a semiconductor fab in a water-stressed region like Arizona:
1.  **Profitability and Value-Add**: High-volume semiconductor manufacturing is a highly profitable and value-added industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. States are willing to incur the costs of building water infrastructure or reallocating water from other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. A 2012 paper comparing land usages in Chandler, Arizona (where fabs are being built), found that the [[economic_impacts_of_semiconductor_facilities_on_water_resources | economic benefits]] from semiconductor manufacturing outweigh the costs of providing water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Governments receive significantly more revenue on a per-acre basis from semiconductor manufacturing than from other land uses, providing a strong incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Much of this revenue comes through property taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
2.  **Water Recycling Capabilities**: The semiconductor industry is affluent enough to invest heavily in water-saving, reuse, and recycling techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This means a much higher percentage of water can theoretically be returned to the [[wastewater_treatment_in_semiconductor_industry | wastewater]] system compared to other land usages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Beyond water, Arizona offers other advantages for foundries, including a ready supply of educated talent, tax incentives, and seismic stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Socio-Political Implications
The high value and profitability of semiconductor manufacturing mean governments are more inclined to find water for it, often by reallocating it from others, typically farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This has been observed in both Taiwan and Arizona, where farmers' water allocations are cut and diverted to tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Agriculture is the primary water user virtually everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. There's an argument that much of current agricultural practice is not an economically efficient use of water, especially groundwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. However, reallocating water from farmers carries significant political consequences, as farmers are valuable constituents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Governments must delicately balance these concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The semiconductor industry's demand for water is expected to continue growing as Moore's Law pushes technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Ongoing advancements in water recycling, reduction techniques, and reuse technologies are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Without these efforts, there may not be enough water to go around for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

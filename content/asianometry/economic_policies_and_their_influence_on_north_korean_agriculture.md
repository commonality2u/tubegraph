The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), also known as North Korea, has long pursued a goal of [[north_koreas_quest_for_food_self-sufficiency | food self-sufficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Reliable information about the country's situation is scarce, often relying on anecdotes or rumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This article parses available information regarding North Korea's agricultural instability and the government's policies to address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Historical Context and Initial Policies

Historically, the northern part of Korea was its industrial heartland, while the south was the breadbasket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. North Korea's geography is largely mountainous, with 80% of its land composed of mountains and uplands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Only about 15% of the country's land is arable, with most farms located on the west coast where conditions are more favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

At the DPRK's founding, the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) inherited an industrialized society from the Japanese occupation government, possessing 72% of the peninsula's industrial capacity and over 90% of its hydroelectric capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This was seized by the WPK regime, and land from Korean landlords and Japanese colonialists was redistributed to the peasantry between 1945 and 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The Korean War (1950-1953) subsequently ravaged the peninsula, devastating industrial infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Central Planning and Collectivization

Following the Korean War, the DPRK sought aid and guidance from China and the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Domestically, the DPRK patterned its economy after the Soviet Union, establishing an orthodox centrally planned economy with the goal of suppressing markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The state owned all businesses and provided all jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

A key agricultural policy was the seizure of all land by the state and the establishment of two types of farms: cooperatives and state farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Farmers were permitted to work only on these collective farms, not on private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The state then owned and confiscated all food grown on these lands for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Eternal Leader Kim Il-sung pushed this collectivization policy to achieve [[north_koreas_quest_for_food_self-sufficiency | food self-reliance]] and to distance North Korea from the Soviet Union's advocacy for tighter economic relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

This collectivization drive, criticized even by communist bloc peers, led to food shortages in the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. In response, the government heavily promoted the use of fertilizers, pesticides, tractors, and irrigation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. While yields stabilized, this made the agricultural sector dangerously dependent on inputs like oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## External Influences and the Great Famine

North Korea accumulated vast debts to its main benefactors, the Soviet Union and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. These unpaid debts led to the Soviets withdrawing various subsidies in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. That same year, the DPRK instituted new agricultural reforms, intensifying double cropping and fertilizer use, raising forests, reclaiming tidal land, and clearing hillsides to expand arable land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This was an attempt to compensate for the loss of Soviet aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. However, these intense practices led to soil depletion and acidification, and the newly cleared land was marginal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

The collapse of the Soviet Union caused North Korea to lose its primary source of coal, oil, and steel, which had accounted for up to two-thirds of its two-way trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The loss of oil particularly hindered fertilizer production and irrigation infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The DPRK then turned to China, which supplied 77% of its fuel and 68% of its food by 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. However, in 1994, China began experiencing its own grain issues and reduced trade with North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### The Arduous March (1990s Famine)
North Korean radio broadcasts began admitting to hunger in 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Studies of mortality rates imply famine conditions began in certain provinces as early as 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **1993:** Rations were delayed or suspended in some provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **1994:** The government began triaging, entirely ending food shipments to four provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **1995:** Coercive grain seizures from farms began, and prison camps were established for those caught foraging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Compounding the policy failures, severe floods occurred in North Korea's four western provinces in 1995 and 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The North Korean government claimed 5 million people were displaced, over 1 million tons of grain lost, and $15 billion in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. While the floods were severe, the government likely exaggerated the damage, using the floods to save face and request aid while deflecting criticism of its political regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

International food aid helped, but not all of it reached those most in need due to disputes and a lack of accountability, leading many charitable organizations to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The scale of the famine remains uncertain, with death estimates ranging from 220,000 to 3.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Post-Famine Reforms and Ongoing Challenges

After the famine, the government made some significant policy changes:
*   **Private Plots:** Households were finally allowed to own and cultivate their own private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. These small gardens, where people grow potatoes, corn, and vegetables, are well-cared for and have significantly improved food security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Devolved Authority:** In 2012, the Kim Jong-un government implemented economic policy changes to devolve more authority to lower levels, allowing workers on collective farms to make more decisions regarding material and investment planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The extent and impact of these reforms are unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Market Formalization:** The government initially cracked down on illegal private markets that emerged during the famine but later formalized them, providing housing, facilities, and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Today, most ordinary North Koreans obtain their food from these markets and private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. The old food rationing system largely collapsed, with state farmers' harvests likely going to political and economic elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

Despite these reforms, North Korean agriculture continues to face several challenges, many exacerbated by past policies:
*   **Deteriorating Soil Quality:** Farmers aggressively plow, till, and use chemical fertilizers, leading to acidic soil, reduced air/water absorption, and poor nutrient uptake by plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Intensive double cropping year after year has also deteriorated the land's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Yields for paddy rice in 2011 were 3.9 tons per hectare, significantly down from 8.0 tons in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Farmers are reluctant to rotate in legumes to improve soil fertility due to fear of not meeting government production goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This situation is unlikely to change as long as goals are set by edict from above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Lack of Technology:** Farmers lack adequate farming technology, such as tractors suited for the country's irregularly shaped fields, and often cannot run or maintain existing technology due to energy or parts shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. The country's inability to raise funds to purchase these items is a major factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Deforestation:** Intensive efforts to expand arable land have involved cutting down trees on hillsides for terraces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. During the great famine, even lands with slopes above 15% were cultivated, despite having poor quality soils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This deforestation contributes to soil erosion, siltation, and makes floods more dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Floods have been noticeably more destructive since these efforts began in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. It also impacts the population's ability to generate energy, as 77% of the rural population relies on wood for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

Kim Jong-un views agricultural revitalization as a core policy, often speaking about improving lives through increased food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. However, his government has been short on concrete policy solutions, offering vague ideas like a "seed revolution" or repeating past practices like double cropping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. While food distribution has improved and famine is no longer a major threat, the country still falls short of [[north_koreas_quest_for_food_self-sufficiency | self-sufficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. The fundamental agricultural situation requires significant change for North Korea to achieve true food security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

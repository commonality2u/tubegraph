Today, Europe is a minor producer and consumer of chips, with EU firms making up a small percentage of semiconductor design, fabrication, and assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While there are world-leading equipment and chemicals companies like ASML, STMicroelectronics, and Infineon, the overall presence is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Historical Context: How Europe Fell Behind

Europe's current position was not inevitable. Europeans independently invented the first transistor just months after the Americans in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. French scientists Herbert Matera and Heinrich Welker, who had studied semiconductor materials during World War II for the German radar program, resumed their work in Paris after the war, inventing a similar device called the "transistron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. By 1949, France had impressive early semiconductor achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

However, this early lead was squandered:
*   **Government Focus Shift** The French government, influenced by the Hiroshima events, decided to focus resources on developing nuclear technology, leaving the telecommunications industry as a private entity without [[government_subsidies_and_investments_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | government funding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Struggles** The French effort consistently struggled with manufacturing, turning towards more abstract and theoretical research due to the unpredictability of early semiconductor production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Unlike the US, where Bell Labs liberally granted licenses and engineers were pushed to handle technological processes themselves, European teams were less interdisciplinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Lack of Industry-Government Initiatives** There was a lack of joint business-government initiatives to bring theoretical breakthroughs to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Key researchers like Pierre Aigrain focused on theoretical physics, and French businesses underinvested in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The electronics industry continued using outdated vacuum tube technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Instability** Economic and political crises in 1957-1958, partly due to the Algerian War, led to austerity policies. The French transistor industry, 90% dependent on the government, lost funding, forcing consumer electronics companies to turn to imports, which eroded profits due to the falling Frank currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Different Demand Structure** In the 1960s, strong American military spending (e.g., Minuteman II ICBM, Apollo program) drove demand for smaller, more reliable, higher-performing devices, pushing the industry to develop advanced techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. In Europe, demand came primarily from the consumer sector, which prioritized cheaper devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. European companies like Philips and Siemens focused on evolutionary improvements to cheaper germanium transistors, believing silicon was only for high-temperature applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Lack of Disruptive Innovation Adoption** While the US industry saw startups like Fairchild (which mass-produced silicon planar transistors, obsoleting older technologies), European firms remained vertically integrated giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Failed Technology Transfer** Despite foreign companies like IBM and Texas Instruments building factories in Europe in the 1960s, successful technology transfer never happened, possibly due to limited labor mobility or lack of explicit requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Computer Industry Prioritization** The French government's "Plan Calcul" in 1966, aimed at developing a national computer industry, inadvertently relegated the domestic semiconductor industry to the "back burner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. French computer companies deemed domestic semiconductors uncompetitive in quantity and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.
*   **Production Scale Issues** Even in the mid-1960s, the issue was largely about production scale, not just innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. French chip makers struggled to achieve sufficient production scale to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
*   **Rise of LSI and Microprocessors** The introduction of the microprocessor (e.g., Intel 4004 in 1971) ushered in an era of rapidly increasing complexity, requiring significant resources for new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. Europe lacked the production capabilities and a strong demand source for these high-performance Large-Scale Integration (LSI) devices, as its computer companies were much smaller than American ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.
*   **Weak Military/Avionics Demand** European military and avionics demand was weak and favored established firms, hindering disruptive technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. The fragmented Telecom market also did not pick up the slack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   **Conservative Corporate Culture** West German policy, for example, relied heavily on large, conservative flagship companies like Siemens, which preferred investing in bonds over technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. Siemens estimated they trailed American technology by a decade in the late 1960s, a gap that widened with LSI and VLSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.
*   **Dependency on External Alliances** European IT companies frequently struck technology alliances with American and Japanese companies rather than other European firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. For example, Sweden's Ericsson, through its subsidiary Rifa, allied with National Semiconductor, AMD, and Texas Instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. Philips partnered with AMD, RCA, and Texas Instruments, while Siemens allied with Intel, Toshiba, and Fujitsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>. Only 25% of European IT companies formed alliances with other European companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

## Past European Initiatives (1980s-1990s)

Despite the decline, European governments and the EU have historically shown willingness to financially support and promote their semiconductor industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.

*   **French Microelectronics Plan (1982)** In 1982, French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand unveiled a five-year plan to spend 4.5 billion francs annually on chip R&D, industrial-university connections, and subsidizing French companies' losses. The goal was to regain domestic market share in small computers and semiconductor manufacturing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. However, French subsidies, though driving new investment, "paled compared to the economic might of the Americans and Japanese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. In 1984, French semiconductor investments were only 1.4% of the world total, as companies struggled with labor, technology, and chronic funding shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.
*   **West German R&D Program (1984)** The West German government launched a major semiconductor R&D program in 1984, allocating 1 billion Deutsche Marks over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.
    *   **Mega Project** A prominent initiative was the "Mega project," a high-profile joint effort where the West German and Dutch governments supported Siemens and Philips in developing a 4-megabit DRAM and a 1-megabit SRAM, respectively, by 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. This was seen as "Europe's last chance against the Japanese chip Invasion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. Siemens debuted its 4-megabit chip in March 1987, a result of significant collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>. However, Siemens had to license 1-megabit DRAM technology from Toshiba, and Philips worked with Matushita for its SRAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. The rapid pace of technological advancement meant Japan's NTT had already debuted a 16-megabit DRAM chip by March 1987, and Korean companies like Samsung were emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
*   **JESSI (Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative) (1989)** The Mega project evolved into JESSI in 1989, a 4-billion-dollar chip research project aimed at developing 6-megabit DRAMs and advanced custom chips through a pan-European consortium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.
    *   **[[challenges_faced_by_european_semiconductor_companies_in_production_and_technology | Challenges faced by JESSI]]** JESSI ran for seven years but faced serious issues:
        *   Philips pulled out of memory production entirely in 1990 due to financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.
        *   Britain's ICL was ejected after being majority acquired by Fujitsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
        *   Siemens allied with IBM, abandoning its plans for a 16-megabit memory device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.
        *   JESSI's budget continuously shrank, impairing its function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.
*   **National Projects** Individual nations also had projects, such as Belgium's microelectronics R&D subsidies, which led to the founding of IMEC, a leading semiconductor research facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

By 1991, European producers had only 10% of world semiconductor production, down from 60% in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. European companies held less than 30% of their own market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.

## Current Situation and Future Outlook

The 1990s saw technological and financial barriers to semiconductor entry soar, with a 250-nanometer memory fab costing $1-2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. Competition intensified with the rise of Asian foundries like TSMC, Charter Semiconductor, and Samsung, benefiting from proximity to the growing Asian electronic supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

The shifting global demand structures further disadvantaged Europe:
*   European firms lost the consumer electronics space to Asian companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.
*   Military and government spending declined after the fall of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.
*   Computing remained dominated by American firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.

While Europe maintains strong and stable positions in industrial, telecommunications, and automobile sectors, these do not capture the majority of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

In 2021, the EU announced plans for the [[government_subsidies_and_investments_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EU Chips Act]], aiming to build strategic autonomy by increasing Europe's share in high-end chip fabrication from its current 10% to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. This market share has remained around 10% since 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.

Despite numerous past rounds of [[government_subsidies_and_investments_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | government money]], R&D coordination, and forced company consolidations, the situation has yet to reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. It remains to be seen if the EU Chips Act will change this historical course or result in "more of the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.

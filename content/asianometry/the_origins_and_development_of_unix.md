The emergence of the Unix operating system was a pivotal moment in technology history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It aimed to provide a platform for software development capable of handling different hardware without being too expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Beginnings: The Multics Project

In 1965, scientists from Bell Labs collaborated with peers from MIT and General Electric on a project known as "Multiplexed Information and Computing Service," or [[the_challenges_and_demise_of_the_multics_project | Multics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The objective was to create a general-purpose utility for time-sharing on a computer system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Given the high cost of computers, time-sharing operating systems were developed to allow multiple users to efficiently share computing resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. These systems evolved into communication tools, connecting multiple users with public profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

General Electric, which had a business selling time shares for their computer systems, provided the [[the_challenges_and_demise_of_the_multics_project | Multics]] team with a GE 645 mainframe computer, simulated with a 635 computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. [[the_challenges_and_demise_of_the_multics_project | Multics]] experimented with concepts such as arbitrary file names, directory structures, and a virtual memory system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Virtual memory allows secondary storage (like a hard drive) to function as part of the main memory (RAM), enabling the computer to handle more data than its physical RAM capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This was a significant improvement over existing file systems and remains in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The [[the_challenges_and_demise_of_the_multics_project | Multics]] team aimed to integrate these pre-existing but unimplemented ideas into a single commercial product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## The End of Multics and Birth of Unix

The [[the_challenges_and_demise_of_the_multics_project | Multics]] project faced difficulties, characterized by excessive spending and a vague plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Frustrated by the lack of a functional product, Bell Labs officially withdrew from the [[the_challenges_and_demise_of_the_multics_project | Multics]] project in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Shortly after, General Electric decided to exit the computer industry, selling its division to Honeywell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Despite this, a few scientists at the Bell Labs Computing Science Research Center—Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Rudd Canaday, Doug McIlroy, and J.F. Ossanna—continued their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The termination of [[the_challenges_and_demise_of_the_multics_project | Multics]] meant losing access to the GE 635 computer they had been using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Ken Thompson, who had developed a space game called "Space Travel" for the GE machine, found it too expensive to play due to computer timeshare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. In 1969, he decided to rewrite the game for an unused, graphics-capable PDP-7 minicomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This project required Thompson to re-implement a debugging subsystem and a floating-point arithmetic package from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, a tedious process involving paper tapes carried between computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### A New File System

After completing "Space Travel," Thompson began implementing ideas for a new file system he had discussed with Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. He quickly implemented this file system on the PDP-7 within a day or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Thompson and others then added simple utilities for copying, printing, deleting, and editing files, along with a basic command interpreter, or "shell," which ran other programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

The concept of the "file" evolved into an interface for data operations like reading and writing, with the file system remaining indifferent to the file's contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This abstraction eliminated differences between various computer hardware, allowing users on any device to modify files, which became a "killer app" for Unix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. By the end of summer 1969, the entire system was rewritten independently of the original GECOS operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Initially viewed as a convenient platform for software development rather than an operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, it was later named "Unics" (a pun on [[the_challenges_and_demise_of_the_multics_project | Multics]]) by Brian Kernighan around 1970, eventually becoming "Unix" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## The Usefulness of Unix

While Unix on the PDP-7 offered a suitable programming environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, the PDP-7 was an outdated minicomputer introduced in 1964, and it was not Bell Labs' property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. In 1970, the team requested a new DEC PDP-11, a recently introduced machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Although previous requests for new computers were denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, this request was approved partly because the PDP-11 was cheaper ($65,000) and came with a compelling pitch to use the file system for creating and editing text files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

Unix was rewritten in the PDP-11's low-level assembly language, incorporating a text editor and a typesetting markup language called "roff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This allowed the Bell Labs Patent Department to adopt Unix over commercial products because Thompson and Ritchie quickly added line-numbered pages to "roff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. What started with three typists in the Patent Department grew into a popular internal product across Bell Labs, with multiple versions and its own support group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Unix Spreads

Initially intended as an internal tool for Bell Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, Unix unexpectedly spread widely throughout computing communities due to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

First, Unix ran on relatively humble hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. A standard Unix computer, typically a PDP-11/40, cost between $50,000 and $150,000 in 1977, significantly cheaper than mainframes which could cost half a million dollars or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

Second, the Unix source code was written in "C," an attractive, higher-level programming language, making it the first OS of its kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Dennis Ritchie developed "C" from "B," which Ken Thompson created by porting the Basic Combined Programming Language (BCPL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Programming in C was much easier than in low-level machine assembly language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Being written in C made Unix easy to port to different hardware architectures beyond the PDP minicomputer family, and also made it easier to modify and enhance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Third, and most importantly, Unix was inexpensive to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. AT&T and Bell Labs sold the Unix source code to non-profits like universities for only a few hundred dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Unlike other software companies that guarded their source code and prohibited modification, Unix allowed users to see and modify the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This contributed to [[the_spread_and_influence_of_unix_in_academia_and_industry | the spread and influence of Unix in academia and industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### The [[the_role_of_att_consent_decree_in_unixs_distribution | AT&T Consent Decree]]

This liberal distribution policy was not an act of benevolence but a consequence of the [[the_role_of_att_consent_decree_in_unixs_distribution | 1956 AT&T Consent Decree]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This anti-trust settlement with the US government granted AT&T a legal monopoly on the US telephone system in exchange for making all its inventions available to the academic community free of charge, or licensing them on fair and reasonable terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. The decree also barred AT&T from entering the computer business, making a computer operating system like Unix commercially useless to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This decree had previously facilitated the spread of the transistor and now did the same for Unix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

AT&T managers, wary of violating the decree, shied away from providing support to licensees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This lack of support inadvertently encouraged university students, who had more cleverness and time than money, to collaborate and implement desired features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. By the early 1970s, Unix had achieved [[the_spread_and_influence_of_unix_in_academia_and_industry | worldwide adoption]], running on university computers in Australia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Berkeley Unix

In November 1973, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie presented the first Unix paper at the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles at Purdue University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. UC Berkeley Professor Bob Fabry obtained a copy of Unix, and departments pooled resources to acquire a PDP minicomputer, as Unix only ran on these machines at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Ken Thompson joined Berkeley as a visiting professor in 1975 to help install Unix Version 6 on a newly acquired PDP 11/70 minicomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

Students Chuck Haley and Bill Joy became highly proficient with Unix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. They completed a Pascal implementation that Thompson had started, enabling Unix to support this higher-level language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Their Pascal implementation was widely admired for its excellent error handling, contrasting with Thompson's less user-friendly error messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Haley and Joy also added utilities, including the "ex" (EXtended) wysiwyg text editor, which later evolved into "vim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

The quality of the Pascal compiler's error recovery and compilation speed led to requests for copies of the Berkeley Unix variant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. In early 1977, Bill Joy assembled and distributed 30 copies of the "Berkeley Software Distribution" (BSD) for approximately $50 per tape, a profitable venture as tapes cost about $10 each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. A second version, "2BSD," quickly followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

In 1978, DEC introduced the VAX-11/780, a 32-bit computer with increased memory and compute power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. AT&T released its UNIX/32V for the VAX, but it lacked support for the VAX's virtual memory capabilities, limiting processing to physical memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. In a "game-changing move," Bill Joy and graduate student Ozalp Babaoglu added virtual memory support, shipping it in December 1979 as 3BSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This established Berkeley as the central coordinator for new, leading-edge Unix releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

### DARPA & the Internet

BSD's development advanced significantly with support from DARPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Before this, DARPA relied on a mix of software written in different languages for various computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. In 1979, DARPA sought to consolidate to a single "universal computing environment" to share software across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. They selected Unix due to its ability to handle different hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. In 1980, Fabry received an 18-month DARPA contract to add features to 3BSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:13:03]</a>.

Fabry and Bill Joy established the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. A small "steering committee" coordinated a global network of volunteer contributors working on the 4BSD or BSD Unix series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This new Unix version needed to support DARPA’s protocols, including those for the Internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. For example, 4.2BSD fully supported the Internet protocol stack TCP/IP, playing a significant role in popularizing the Internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. 4.2BSD was highly popular, with over a thousand licenses issued within a month of its April 1983 release, surpassing all previous distributions combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## From Hobby to Industry: [[the_commercialization_and_variants_of_unix | The Commercialization and Variants of Unix]]

In summer 1982, Bill Joy announced his departure from CSRG to become a co-founder of [[history_and_formation_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:14:02]</a>. While his work at BSD was financially rewarding, he felt the academic environment at Berkeley hindered growth, stating that it "needed to be a commercial activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

[[history_and_formation_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] became known for pioneering and popularizing the workstation computer, which included the Unix OS with scientific/engineering applications, the Motorola 68000 microprocessor, and other off-the-shelf hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. [[history_and_formation_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] later developed its own closed-source [[the_commercialization_and_variants_of_unix | Unix variant]], SunOS, which branched from 4.2BSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. While a single Sun workstation couldn't match a mainframe, these networked machines became immensely valuable, leading [[sun_microsystems_business_model_and_initial_success | Sun Microsystems]] to become one of Silicon Valley's fastest-growing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

[[the_commercialization_and_variants_of_unix | Sun Microsystems]] was not the only company to commercialize Unix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Other notable Unix-based startups included:
*   **Mt. Xinu**: A Berkeley-based software company that sold a commercially licensed version of BSD for the DEC Vax minicomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Their slogan was "We know Unix(TM) backwards and forwards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **Santa Cruz Operation**: Sold Unix [[the_commercialization_and_variants_of_unix | variants]] for x86 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Onyx Systems**: Marketed a [[the_commercialization_and_variants_of_unix | variant of Unix]] for Zilog-based Personal Computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.
*   **Microsoft**: Developed Xenix, a Unix [[the_commercialization_and_variants_of_unix | variant]] for 16-bit microcomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
*   **NeXT**: Steve Jobs' workstation computer startup, founded in 1985, whose operating system NeXTSTEP was derived from 4.3BSD Tahoe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Conclusion

Unix pioneered powerful concepts that contributed to software becoming the powerhouse industry it is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Its early development was driven by individuals interested in technology rather than financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. However, as the community and potential for Unix grew, it became clear that the work surrounding it needed to transition into a commercial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. By 1983, Unix's formative years concluded, setting the stage for the intense competition known as the Unix Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

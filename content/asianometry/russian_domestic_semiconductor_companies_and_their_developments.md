In late February 2022, Taiwan's TSMC halted shipments to Russia due to a new round of sanctions, impacting companies like Baikal, MCST, Yadro, and STC Module [00:00:00]. Intel and AMD also ceased their shipments to Russia [00:00:19]. Russia has been attempting to establish its own semiconductor supply, but despite some domestic design successes, manufacturing capacity has fallen significantly behind [00:00:23]. This article provides an overview of [[challenges_in_russian_semiconductor_manufacturing | Russia's ever-worsening domestic semiconductor manufacturing industry]] [00:00:42].

## Historical Context
The [[history_of_soviet_semiconductor_technology | Soviet Union]] suffered from a substantial technology gap in computers and advanced electronics with the United States, dating back to the 1960s [00:01:13]. This gap was rooted in ideology, technology, and geopolitics [00:01:24]. By the time of the Soviet collapse in 1991, the country was experiencing a severe shortage of sufficiently powerful integrated circuits [00:01:33]. The combined computing power of all computers in the Soviet Union was two generations behind a single American Cray supercomputer [00:01:40].

The collapse fragmented the Soviet scientific industrial complex [00:01:49]. Russia was left with 96% of vacuum electronics production facilities, while the more advanced semiconductor production facilities were located in East Germany, Belarus, Ukraine, and other former Soviet republics [00:01:56]. Russian industrial policy immediately after the collapse worsened the situation by shifting away from domestic electronics, increasing the country's dependence on imports [00:02:08].

Today, Russia remains a consumer and net importer of integrated circuits [00:02:20]. In 2020, the majority of these integrated circuits came from Malaysia, [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China]], Vietnam, and other Asian regions including Taiwan [00:02:25].

## Domestic Semiconductor Companies

### Micron Group
Following threatened sanctions in 2014 after the Crimea annexation, the Russian government decided to develop its own homegrown chips through an import substitution scheme [00:02:35]. This initiative led to the Elbrus 2SM, a 90 nanometer CPU developed by the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies, which was fabricated within Russia by JSC Micron Group [00:02:44].

Micron Group is Russia's largest domestic semiconductor manufacturing company [00:02:58]. It operates as an integrated design manufacturer, contributing 54% of the country's exported technology hardware products and producing approximately 500 million chips annually [00:03:02].

**History and Products**:
*   Micron's origins trace back to 1964 as the Research Institute for Molecular Electronics [00:03:12]. Its plant was the first in the country to successfully produce an integrated circuit [00:03:20].
*   Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the plant produced microprocessors for applications such as air defense and the Venus space programs [00:03:25].
*   Micron, along with Angstrom of Russia and Integral of Belarus, constituted the Soviet Union's "big three" IC manufacturers [00:03:32].
*   In the 1990s, the plant transitioned into a joint-stock company [00:03:42].
*   Currently, Micron fabs RFID tickets, SIM cards, and other smart card products [00:03:44]. RFID is a company specialty, producing about 30 million banking cards, biometric passports, and transport cards annually [00:03:51]. They fabricated the bank chips for Russia's domestic payment card system, Mir, and travel tickets for Moscow's transport network [00:04:00].
*   Micron employs around 1,500 people and serves over 400 customers in Russia, including top cell carriers, transport companies, leading banks, and government agencies [00:04:07]. They also have 100 international customers serviced by offices in Japan, [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China]], and Germany [00:04:18].

**Financials**:
*   In 2019, Micron generated about $195 million USD in revenue [00:04:25].
*   In 2020, revenues increased to $260 million USD, bolstered by significant subsidies from various Moscow government organizations [00:04:36].
*   Profit figures are not available, but the company reported a net loss in 2015 [00:04:42].

**Fabs and Process Nodes**:
*   Micron's Zelenograd fab produces 100mm, 150mm, and 200mm wafers, with the 200mm line being the most sophisticated [00:04:48].
*   In 2007, Micron signed a technology transfer deal with STMicroelectronics to acquire IP for their 180 nanometer process node [00:04:58]. This deal expanded in 2010 to include the 90 nanometer node [00:05:07].
*   The 90 nanometer production line launched in 2012, costing 16.5 billion rubles (approximately $590 million USD at 2017 exchange rates) [00:05:11]. This project was co-financed by Rusnano, a government fund promoting domestic nanotechnologies [00:05:25]. At this point, Russia was about nine years behind the leading edge, as the 90nm node first reached commercial production globally in 2003 [00:05:32].
*   Micron aimed for indigenous development of the next node, the 65 nanometer node [00:05:40]. In 2014, Micron announced the successful achievement of the 65 nanometer node at a volume of 500 200mm wafers per month [00:05:53]. Headlines declared this as proof of "Russian technology independence" [00:06:08].
*   However, this announcement appears to have been premature; the process was more a "working science experiment" than a commercial offering [00:06:14]. Without better lithography scanners, primarily imported from the West or Japan, a 65 nanometer line is not commercially viable [00:06:23].
*   Micron's website claims capability for 65 nanometer chips (making it Russia's only such fab) but adds an asterisk stating that its 65 nanometer production line remains "under development, production qualification, and implementation" [00:06:32]. This suggests it is not yet ready [00:06:49]. Fujitsu, Toshiba, and TSMC began shipping commercial 65 nanometer nodes in 2005, meaning Russia's gap with the leading edge has widened from 9 years to over 15 years [00:06:52].
*   In 2016, Micron replaced its management team [00:07:04]. The new team announced plans to invest in factory expansion to produce more chip types and LEDs, aiming for 30 billion rubles in revenue by 2020 [00:07:13]. This ambitious plan included a 28 nanometer-capable factory in 2018, though little has been heard about it recently [00:07:25]. The company missed its 2020 target by 15 billion rubles [00:07:32].

### Sitronics
Sitronics is a sister company to Micron [00:07:39]. In 2007, Sitronics applied for a subsidy to develop a chip manufacturing fab at the 65 and 45 nanometer process nodes on 300mm wafers [00:07:49]. This proposed project, jointly financed with the Russian government, was estimated to cost about $2.3 billion USD [00:08:00]. This was a substantial amount, considering Sitronics' total revenues in 2012 were only about half that [00:08:06]. Chip production was scheduled to begin in 2009 [00:08:12]. However, the high capital intensity of the project likely caused Sitronics to pull back, especially as there were no technology partners [00:08:17]. Currently, the company's website lists servers, IT software, and smartwatches, but no chips [00:08:27].

### Angstrom
Angstrom is another one of Russia's leading microelectronics fabs, headquartered in Zelenograd alongside Micron [00:08:34].

**History and Products**:
*   Angstrom dates back to 1963, founded as the Research Institute of Precision Technology [00:08:46]. The plant was known for developing and producing the Elektronika NTS 8010, the Soviet Union's first completely domestic computer [00:08:53].
*   Currently, the foundry offers 130 nanometer and 90 nanometer process nodes on 200mm wafers [00:09:03]. Their capacity is approximately 180,000 wafers per year [00:09:09]. This is a tiny fraction [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | compared to a TSMC gigafab]], which produces the equivalent number in a single month [00:09:15].

**Financial and Operational Challenges**:
*   This lack of scale likely contributed to Angstrom filing for bankruptcy sometime in 2018 or 2019 [00:09:21].
*   In 2008, the company borrowed nearly a billion dollars from the state development bank VEB to purchase old 110nm and 130nm chip-making equipment from AMD [00:09:30]. The plan was to start producing 90nm smart card microchips by 2010 while simultaneously upgrading to the 65nm node [00:09:42].
*   However, Angstrom failed to meet this target, with chips only starting to roll off the line in 2016, and its 65nm process is not yet available [00:09:52].
*   Shortly thereafter, Angstrom was hit by U.S. sanctions, likely due to its involvement in the Russian military and nuclear industries [00:10:04]. This prevented it from building an export business, and combined with its debt, pushed it into insolvency [00:10:12].
*   In 2021, VEB founded a subsidiary called NM-Tech, which purchased Angstrom's assets for 8.4 billion rubles [00:10:18]. NM-Tech has a 10-year plan to convert Angstrom into a pure-play foundry and pursue 10 nanometer production [00:10:27].

## Fabless Design Companies (Relying on Foreign Fabs)
Due to the lagging capabilities of the domestic industry, more sophisticated Russian semiconductor design ventures have had to outsource fabrication of their chips abroad [00:10:39]. The two most notable efforts are the Elbrus microprocessors by the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies (MCST) and the Baikal CPUs by Baikal Electronics [00:10:52].

### Elbrus (MCST)
*   The Elbrus 2SM was hailed as the first completely Russian microprocessor upon its creation in 2014, declared the year's top technology achievement by local media [00:11:04].
*   This 90 nanometer processor was likely more for PR than practical use [00:11:21]. An earlier iteration, made using a TSMC 90 nanometer node, appeared to perform significantly better than the Micron-fabricated version, though benchmarks are needed for confirmation [00:11:28].
*   The latest iteration, the Elbrus 8CB chip, was fabricated on a 28 nanometer process [00:11:49].

### Baikal Electronics
*   Baikal Electronics employs a different approach, utilizing modern practices and EDA tools like Synopsys to develop ARM-based chips [00:12:00].
*   Their latest offering is the Baikal-M series, an eight-core system-on-chip fabricated on a TSMC 28 nanometer process [00:12:09]. A RISC-V version is also being explored [00:12:18].
*   Sales appeared to be doing well, with Baikal announcing plans in November 2020 to order over 200,000 pieces from TSMC in Q1 2021 [00:12:21]. However, the company faced issues securing enough fab capacity due to global automaker chip shortages [00:12:32].
*   In June 2021, Baikal was acquired by the Varton Group, an electronics conglomerate that also develops Russia's domestic OS, AstroLinux (frequently used by the Russian government and military) [00:12:39].
*   Baikal then announced a plan to invest 23 billion rubles to expand into the server space, develop a 6 nanometer chip, and sell over half a million Baikal chips, primarily to government organizations fulfilling import substitution policies [00:12:55].

## Outlook
Considering the current circumstances, it is doubtful that the [[future_prospects_for_chinese_semiconductor_manufacturing | Russian semiconductor manufacturing industry]] will advance beyond 65 nanometers in the foreseeable future [00:13:12].

### Potential Alternatives for Russian Semiconductor Needs
While [[potential_alternatives_for_russian_semiconductor_needs | friendly countries]] might offer alternatives, current options have limitations:
*   **Belarus**: A significant portion of Soviet integrated circuit production was in Belarus [00:13:29]. Integral, the third of the "big three" Soviet semiconductor manufacturers, was launched in 1962 [00:13:40]. However, its most sophisticated node is a 350 nanometer process (first on the market in 1993, used for the Nintendo 64), which is not a viable alternative to a TSMC 28 nanometer node [00:13:52].
*   **[[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | Chinese Semiconductor Foundries]]**: Chinese foundries, such as Shanghai-based SMIC, might be a more capable TSMC replacement [00:14:12]. SMIC's most advanced node is a 14 nanometer process, rumored to have good yields, though it's not a large part of their overall business [00:14:18]. SMIC had a strong 2021 and is investing $9 billion in a new fab [00:14:29]. Given current warm relations between Russia and China, SMIC could be a logical choice [00:14:36]. However, SMIC heavily relies on chip-making equipment imports from the Netherlands and Japan [00:14:44].

In the short and medium term, the halt in shipments may not have an immediate drastic impact, as Russia holds large stockpiles and has contingency plans [00:14:50]. Furthermore, many military applications do not require leading-edge chips [00:15:00]. However, these sanctions will further hinder the country's industries, causing them to fall behind competitors [00:15:04]. Even Russia's largest industries consistently lag Western peers in digitalization and modernization [00:15:08]. Russia has 23 times fewer industrial robots per 10,000 employees than the world average, and only 10% of its industry uses computer numerical control (CNC) machines, with just 1% of data from installed sensors being utilized [00:15:17]. These sanctions make it significantly harder for Russian businesses and citizens to catch up [00:15:35].

During the late Soviet regime, the Communist Party's failure to close the widening technology gap with the West contributed to a broad loss of public confidence in its competence [00:15:43]. While times are different today, there may be parallels [00:15:54].

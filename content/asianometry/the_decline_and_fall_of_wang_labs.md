The story of Wang Labs, a once-dominant computing pioneer, is marked by an incredibly sad fall following its impressive rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Despite its initial success, a confluence of strategic missteps, leadership challenges, and a failure to adapt to changing market dynamics ultimately led to its demise.

## Early Signs of Trouble and Leadership Transition

By 1980, Dr. An Wang, the company's founder, began to slow down as he turned 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. In 1982, he started spending less time at the office, formally retiring in 1983 while retaining his position as chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. John A. Cunningham, a respected 16-year sales employee, took over as president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

However, a critical factor in the company's decline was An Wang's plan to eventually pass control of Wang Labs to his sons, Fred and Courtney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. An Wang was not only CEO but also chief of product development, intimately involved in crafting the company's most successful products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. In 1980, he placed Fred Wang in charge of the crucial R&D department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. Despite being a smart and decent person, Fred lacked his father's unique touch and ability to manage the powerful egos within R&D, leading to a disastrous situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

## Product Delays and Missed Market Shifts

The turning point for [[business_strategies_and_challenges_of_wang_labs | Wang Labs]] began with its products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. In October 1983, Wang Labs announced 14 new products, including the Wang Professional Image Computer, hoping to challenge IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. While the market initially reacted positively, with the stock soaring to $36.50 and peaking at $42.50 in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, all of these products came out very late, in some cases years late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Fred Wang's rush to announce products before they were ready severely damaged his credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

This period was critical because competition was intensifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. Two years prior, IBM had released the IBM PC, which rapidly gained popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. These PCs, equipped with word processing and spreadsheet software, began eroding Wang's market share for its specialized word processors and 2200 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

An Wang himself resisted the PC revolution, believing it to be another "calculator"â€”a future dead-end commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. While Fred eventually pushed the company to build their own PC, it lacked compatibility with the IBM PC's massive software ecosystem, making it "Dead on Arrival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. This failure to adapt to the PC market and to find the next hit product was a major factor in Wang's decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.

## Financial Deterioration and Leadership Turmoil

The company never truly recovered from the botched 1983 product announcements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. Cunningham, then president, concluded that Fred could not manage the R&D division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. Despite Cunningham's arguments, An Wang moved Fred to run manufacturing in October 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. The R&D department continued to produce unsuccessful products, and debt accumulated as the company expanded recklessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

An Wang rejected potential mergers with Exxon's computer subsidiary and the ITT conglomerate, which could have shored up the company's debt, because they would have taken control away from the Wang family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. His loyalty to his family, despite being past his prime, ultimately led the company down the wrong path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

In April 1985, Wang Labs announced a stunning 66% quarterly profit decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. In July 1985, John Cunningham resigned, selling all his stock, marking the beginning of the end for the company's "magical nine-year joyride" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

An Wang briefly reassumed leadership, but in 1987, he made Fred president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. The company experienced unsteady profits, leading to a thousand layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. The board of directors repeatedly requested a professional manager to work with Fred, but An Wang famously refused, stating, "He is my son and he can do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

Losses escalated throughout 1988, damaging relations with banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. In July 1989, Wang Labs posted a staggering $424 million annual loss, suspended dividends, and laid off more employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. The stock crashed from $43 to just $5 a share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

## An Wang's Final Days and Company's End

In 1989, An Wang was diagnosed with esophageal cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. In August 1989, shortly after undergoing surgery, he was forced to fire his own son, Fred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. Richard Miller, a turnaround expert with no computer industry experience, was appointed president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

Miller initiated a massive $200 million asset sale and laid off 2,000 more employees in an attempt to cut debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. Despite these efforts, the company still reported a $715.9 million loss in 1990, a stunning figure considering its $2.5 billion in revenues that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.

In January 1990, An Wang's cancer returned, and he lost his ability to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. He finally relinquished control, allowing Miller to make necessary decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. An Wang passed away on March 24, 1990, at the age of 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>. In his last conversation, he implored Miller to try and save Wang Labs, wishing for it to be remembered as a company founded by an immigrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.

Despite continued asset sales and an alliance with IBM, Wang Laboratories filed for bankruptcy in 1992, two years after its founder's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. It was acquired in 1999 by the Dutch company Getronics and renamed Getronics North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

Ultimately, while Fred's leadership struggles contributed, Wang's failure primarily stemmed from An Wang's resistance to the PC revolution, the underestimation of office software's power, and the company's inability to find the next breakthrough product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. This generational transition proved insurmountable for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.

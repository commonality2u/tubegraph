The British government played a significant, albeit complex, role in shaping the UK's computer industry, particularly in its efforts to create a national champion capable of competing with global giants like IBM.

## Formation of ICL

In 1968, the British government orchestrated a "shotgun marriage" between three computer manufacturers to establish International Computers Limited (ICL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The government's vision was for ICL to serve as the United Kingdom's answer to IBM, a national champion in computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This intervention aimed to consolidate a fragmented industry, which by 1964, was primarily composed of English Electric and International Computers and Tabulators Limited (ICT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

## Early Initiatives and Concerns

Following World War II, British policymakers became concerned about the nation's capacity to capitalize on its scientific and industrial innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. In response, the Labour government founded the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. The NRDC's objectives were to secure the national development of the UK's public research and to acquire and hold rights to inventions from this research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

By 1949, Lord Halsbury, NRDC's first general manager, believed the British computing industry could not compete with American giants, leading him to encourage British businesses to enter the computing sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Ministry of Technology and Consolidation Efforts

In October 1964, the Harold Wilson government established the Ministry of Technology (Mintec), with the British computer industry as its primary focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. Mintec believed urgent action was needed to prevent the industry's rapid demise in the face of formidable American competition, a concern shared by France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. The UK was one of the last European strongholds where IBM did not have dominant market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

Mintec sought to consolidate the industry, specifically by merging English Electric and ICT, to enable competition against IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. Initial merger discussions in 1964 failed as both companies felt strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. However, after the Wilson government's re-election in 1966, they persistently pursued their vision, offering a "dowry" of up to 30 million pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. The companies agreed to merge in 1967, though economic conditions in 1968, including the devaluation of the British pound, reduced the government's dowry to 13.5 million pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. This [[impact_of_mergers_and_consolidation_on_the_uk_computing_industry | merger]] created ICL in July 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

## Impact and Challenges of Intervention

ICL, with 34,000 employees and 100 million pounds in annual revenue, became the world's largest non-American computer manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. Its mission was to rationalize its computer range, boost R&D, and compete with IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. However, political pressure from the Labour government prevented ICL from phasing out the technically outdated 1900 series, as the System 4 (from English Electric) was not considered "British made," thus hindering ICL's efforts to streamline its product line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

This political interference kept ICL focused as a mainframe manufacturer, inadvertently leading to its marginalization as it missed the minicomputer boom of the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

## Shifting Government Stances and Continued Aid

During the 1968 computer industry recession, ICL called for government intervention and aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. However, the Conservative government elected in 1970, led by Edward Heath, merged Mintec and adopted an anti-interventionist stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. This position was questioned when the UK government had to [[role_of_government_intervention_in_corporate_insolvency | rescue Rolls-Royce]] in February 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>, especially given that France and Germany were providing hundreds of millions in [[government_subsidies_and_their_effects_on_the_semiconductor_industry | government support]] to their own computer industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.

Despite the initial stance, ICL ultimately received a 40 million pound loan from the government in 1971, which helped maintain its R&D from 1972 to 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. However, it became apparent that ICL could not afford the heavy R&D costs required to remain competitive in the British mainframe computing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

By 1980, facing another economic recession and significant losses, ICL again sought government assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. The newly elected Thatcher government was initially reluctant but eventually agreed to a 200 million pound loan guarantee, provided the management team was replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

## Long-Term Consequences

The 1981 government rescue and subsequent partnership with Fujitsu marked the end of ICL's aspirations to be a national champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>. The company significantly cut its R&D spending and increasingly relied on external vendors for its products, eventually evolving into an assembler and distributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.

Ultimately, the focus on national prestige and the desire to emulate IBM's vertically integrated model led ICL and its political sponsors to invest heavily in mainframe computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. However, this national champion could not muster the resources needed to compete with the real thing, nor adapt to the splintering of the computer industry where specialized companies in software and other niches raised the competitive bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

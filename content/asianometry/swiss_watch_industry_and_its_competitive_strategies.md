At the time of Japan's opening up, nearly all of the world's watches originated from either the United States or Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The Swiss historically sought to prevent their watchmaking secrets from spreading to other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Early Industry Structure and Global Dominance

At the turn of the 20th century, the global watch market was primarily divided between the United States and Switzerland, though their success models differed significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Unlike the large-scale, automated production in the United States, the Swiss watch industry was characterized by many small companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. These firms contributed to a wide range of high-precision timepieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. In 1901, Swiss statistics showed 663 watch industry firms employing 24,858 people, with the largest company, Longines, employing just 853 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Longines produced 130,000 pieces in 1905, while American companies like Waltham were producing multiples more annually a few years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Swiss diversity was a strength, enabling the production of many products to cater to various needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. All of these products were exported abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Switzerland dominated the pocket watch export market, holding approximately 93% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Challenges from Japan and the "Shablon" Practice

The Swiss watch industry faced increasing competition as Japan began its own watchmaking development. Japan's government implemented an [[role_of_tariffs_and_trade_policies_in_watch_industry | import substitution policy]] starting in 1899, raising tariffs on finished watches to protect domestic manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Tariffs on silver and nickel watch imports, initially 5%, increased to 25% and then 40% by 1906 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

This policy led to the rise of "shablon," a practice where Japanese companies imported disassembled watch movement sets (named after the word *shablon* which means movement sets) and assembled them within Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. These imported parts were not subject to the same high tariffs as finished watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. For example, from 1915 to 1935, Switzerland supplied 69% of Japan's watch parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The number of watch movements imported by Japan surged dramatically after the tariffs were imposed, far exceeding finished watch imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

The Swiss watch industry grew concerned, rightly viewing shablon as a long-term threat that would transfer critical watchmaking expertise to other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. A notable instance was Rudolph Schmidt, a Swiss citizen who settled in Yokohama in 1894 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Initially importing complete watches, he shifted to importing shablon after Japan raised tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. By 1910, Schmidt moved his entire watch production process, including case making, to Japan, alarming the Swiss watch industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Schmidt's company eventually became the Citizen Watch Company, one of Japan's two significant watchmakers alongside Hattori (Seiko) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Restructuring and Cartelization

The expansion of Japanese watchmakers like Hattori (Seiko) and Citizen abroad, with Hattori's factory becoming the largest in the world by 1935 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, intensified Swiss concerns. With watch exports declining throughout the 1920s, the Swiss responded by reorganizing their industry into a cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

Key measures included:
*   **Watchmaking Conventions**: Part suppliers signed agreements, restricting business to members within the cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **ASAG Holding Company**: A holding company named ASAG was established to acquire various movement manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Government Control**: In 1934, the Swiss government stepped in, controlling all watchmaking activities and monitoring exports of watch parts and machine tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Shablon Made Illegal**: The practice of importing disassembled watch movement sets (shablon) was explicitly prohibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

These actions largely succeeded in their goals for the next few decades, allowing the Swiss watch industry to enjoy high profits and a consistent 50% share of the global watch market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Impact of World War II

During World War II, most watch companies halted production and diverted metals for the war effort, with many drafted into producing precision tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. However, the Swiss watch industry maintained neutrality, giving them a significant advantage in the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. American watch companies, for instance, struggled post-war against cheap Swiss watch imports, leading to a long-term decline and consolidation despite new tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

## The Quartz Crisis and Market Shift

Despite the Swiss success in mechanical watchmaking, the industry fundamentally "fumbled" the [[transition_from_mechanical_to_quartz_watches | shift to quartz]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. Even though they had been aware of quartz technology for a long time and had even demoed their own prototypes in 1967 (two years before Seiko's Astron) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>, the industry was slow to adapt.

Reasons for their struggle included:
*   **Pride in Mechanical Heritage**: The Swiss took great pride in their legacy of intricate mechanical watchmaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
*   **Sprawling Industry Structure**: Their industry structure, composed of many small firms, worked against them. No single Swiss company possessed the resources, initiative, or broad expertise to develop a quartz watch on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
*   **Technological Disruption**: While mechanical watches require trained artisans and painstaking effort, digital watches made with modern [[impact_of_technological_advancements_in_watches | semiconductor production methods]] could achieve titanic scale and accuracy, overwhelming traditional human training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

The rise of quartz watches, spearheaded by Japanese companies like Seiko, Citizen, and Casio, ended the Swiss grip on the global watch industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. The Japanese pushed the Swiss out of their most valuable markets, particularly the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. As late as 1974, Switzerland held 40% of the global market, but within 10 years, this share shrank to just 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. By 1983, over half of the country's watchmakers had gone bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

## Comeback and Niche Specialization

Due to necessity, the Swiss watch industry did shift to quartz technologies, and for a brief period, it seemed that mechanical watch production techniques might be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. However, the Swiss mechanical watch industry has since made a comeback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

This comeback was achieved by:
*   **Recognizing Intrinsic Value**: The industry recognized that their products possessed value beyond merely accurately keeping time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   **Restructuring**: The industry restructured into the Swatch Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.
*   **Focus on Luxury**: They created and focused on luxury watch brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

Through these strategies, the Swiss watch industry has thrived in its specialized niche, distinguishing itself from the mass-produced, affordable digital watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

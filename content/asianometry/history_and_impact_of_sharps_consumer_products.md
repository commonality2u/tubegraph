Sharp Corporation, a Japanese company with over 100 years of history, has been responsible for numerous iconic consumer products, including mechanical pencils, calculators, and televisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, starting around the turn of the century, the company faced significant challenges due to intense competition, eventually leading to its [[Acquisition of Sharp by Foxconn | acquisition]] by a Taiwanese electronics giant, marking the first foreign takeover of a major Japanese consumer electronics company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Early Innovations and Foundations

The company was founded by Takuji Hayakawa, born in 1893 in Tokyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. After a difficult childhood, he apprenticed as a metal worker for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### The Tokubido Buckle and Mechanical Pencil
Hayakawa's first invention was the "Tokubido" belt buckle, which could be fastened without needing to punch holes in the belt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This product was a success, selling 4,752 pieces and requiring a significant expansion in capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. At the age of 19, Hayakawa opened his own metal workshop in Tokyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

In 1915, an order for metal components for a mechanical pencil led Hayakawa to develop his own superior version, known as the "Hayakawa mechanical pencil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This pencil became a hit, especially during World War I when imports from Germany were scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The business expanded rapidly, leading to the construction of a new factory in 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### The Great Kanto Earthquake and Rebuilding
On September 1, 1923, the Great Kanto earthquake struck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. While Hayakawa and his factory initially survived, his wife and two young children perished in the fires that followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The factory burned down, and Hayakawa transferred his pencil-making equipment and patents to his distributor to fulfill orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. He then moved to Osaka, resolving to rebuild his business there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Entry into Radio and Television
In 1924, Hayakawa established Hayakawa Metal Laboratories and began working on a new product: the crystal radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Despite having no prior knowledge of electricity or radio principles, he and his team reverse-engineered an imported radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

In 1925, they released their domestically assembled crystal radio, named "Sharp," which was drastically cheaper than foreign competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The "Sharp" radio launched at a perfect time, coinciding with Japan's first radio program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Recognizing the limitations of crystal radios, Hayakawa later produced the "Sharp-Dyne" series of vacuum tube radios, which boosted signal power and volume, selling extremely well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

By 1942, the company changed its name to Hayakawa Electric Company, producing various radios for consumer and military use, which sustained them through the war and post-war reconstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

In 1951, as experimental television broadcasts began in Japan, Hayakawa Electric aimed to be ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. With technical assistance from RCA, they produced Japan's first commercially available television, the TV 314T, released in February 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Despite its high cost, its timely entrance secured Hayakawa's dominance in the domestic television market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

Hayakawa Electric also branched into other categories, releasing Japan's first microwave (R-10) and first solar-powered consumer electronics product (a transistor radio) in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The company remained a dominant solar cell producer into the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Calculator Era and LCD Breakthrough

In the 1960s, Hayakawa Electric decided to focus on sophisticated non-programmable consumer electronics like calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. In 1964, they released the CS-10A, one of the first all-transistor calculators, which weighed 25 kilograms and cost approximately $15,000 in today's USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. It sold out its initial 300-unit supply within months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

Subsequent models like the CS-20A (1965) and CS-31A (1966) were more power-efficient, reliable, and cheaper, with the CS-31A being the first desktop calculator to use integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. By 1966, Hayakawa led the Japanese calculator industry with 44% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

In 1970, Hayakawa Electric officially changed its name to Sharp Corporation, deriving the brand name from its early mechanical pencil product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. The calculator market, however, saw intense competition known as the "calculator Wars," which pushed companies like Sharp to continuously innovate for smaller, cheaper, and faster devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### The Development of Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD)
Calculators at the time used expensive, large, and power-inefficient fluorescent display tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. In 1969, a Sharp researcher learned about Dynamic Scattering Mode (DSM) Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) demonstrated by RCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Although RCA was not interested in developing LCDs for calculators, Sharp licensed RCA's patents in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

Sharp's team, S-734, worked to create a suitable liquid crystal mixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. In June 1973, Sharp launched the LC-Mate EL-805, a revolutionary calculator with an LCD display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. It was 12 times thinner than its closest competitor, used 1/9000th the power, could run for 100 hours on a single charge, and weighed just 200 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

Sharp continued its [[Sharps involvement in the LCD and electronics industry | studies on LCD technology]], and in the mid-1980s, identified IBM's full-color silicon-based display technology, TFT LCD, as a potential replacement for CRTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. By 1987, Sharp successfully produced a 14-inch full-color, full-motion LCD display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. In 1991, they debuted the first wall-mounted television, the 9EHC1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

## The LCD Pivot and Decline

Despite Sharp's strong position in LCD technology, the company faced significant [[Challenges faced by Sharp in the global market | challenges]] as Japan's domestic economy weakened due to a strong Yen, increasing wages, and manufacturing offshoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Cheap foreign imports challenged older products like fax machines, calculators, and microwave ovens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. While some new products like the ViewCam camcorder were successful, others, like the Wizard electronic organizer, failed to gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

Profits declined throughout the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. By 1998, LCD panels and related products accounted for 30% of company revenues, becoming the company's "one bright spot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. New president Katsuhiko Machida decided to reposition Sharp with its LCD business at its core, calling it "the crystal clear company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

Sharp abandoned its venerable CRT television business (dating back to 1953) and went "all in" on LCD televisions, launching its Aquos TV brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. This bold move initially paid off, with Aquos capturing 80% global market share in the nascent LCD TV market by 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

However, the competition, especially from South Korean firms like Samsung and LG, caught up rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. Samsung surprised the industry by being the first to produce leading-edge 5th generation LCDs in early 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Sharp responded by investing billions of yen into new TFT LCD factories across Japan, including the massive Kamiyama plant (completed 2004 and 2006) which cost $4 billion USD and produced over a million panels annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

These massive investments strained company finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. The Kamiyama plant came online simultaneously with other large facilities built by competitors, leading to an oversupply in the LCD panel industry by 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. The cost of a 32-inch TV panel dropped significantly, from $865 in 2004 to $149 by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

Sharp's TV market share plummeted from 80% to under 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. Despite this, Sharp continued to invest in production capacity, leading to the construction of the Sakai factories (costing $3.4 billion USD) announced in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. A partnership with Sony for the Sakai factories failed due to internal conflicts between Sharp's TV and display panel divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

The global financial crisis in 2008 further exacerbated Sharp's problems, leading to sales collapse and increased losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. In March 2009, Sharp announced its first net loss since going public in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. By 2012, Sharp reported a net loss of over $5 billion USD, nearing bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. The company also missed critical industry transitions, such as the shift to LED-backlit LCD screens and OLED technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

## [[Acquisition of Sharp by Foxconn | Foxconn's Acquisition]] and Future Direction

In 2012, Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics giant, acquired a 9.9% stake in Sharp for $854 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. Foxconn, seeking to vertically integrate its supply chain, saw Sharp's display expertise as valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. Sharp, however, initially declined a full acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

After several more difficult years and staggering losses, Sharp finally accepted Foxconn's offer in 2016, selling a controlling 66% stake for $3.8 billion (revised down from $6.2 billion due to financial liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. This acquisition marked the first foreign takeover of a leading Japanese electronics firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.

Under Foxconn's leadership, Taiwanese CEO Tai Jeng-wu implemented cost-cutting measures, closed unprofitable overseas ventures, and moved production out of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. In its first full year under Taiwanese management, Sharp turned a small profit, its first in four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Tai reoriented the company back towards producing branded electronics products and began rebuilding Sharp's semiconductor manufacturing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. The current CEO, appointed in February 2022, also comes from Foxconn's brand products division, indicating a continued focus on branded electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

Sharp's [[Rise and fall of Sharp Corporation | trajectory]] highlights how relying too heavily on a single technology, even a superior one, can lead to vulnerability in a competitive market like display panels, which became a brutal, low-margin business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

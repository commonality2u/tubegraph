From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Despite its early and rapid success, the [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq Computer Company]] eventually faced significant challenges that led to its decline and eventual acquisition. Initially, [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] achieved incredible growth, hitting $111 million in revenue in its first year (1982) and becoming the fastest company in history to reach $1.2 billion in revenue by 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. [[Compaqs role in the PC clone market | Compaq]] led an insurgency of IBM PC clone-makers, opening up the PC standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. However, this success sowed the seeds of its future problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## The Revolution Turns
The tragedy of [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] was that it led the PC revolution, but then the revolution turned on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Initial Strengths and Subsequent Weaknesses
[[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]]'s early growth was driven by several factors that later became vulnerabilities:

*   **Product Differentiations and Compatibility**
    [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] offered a breakthrough product, the Compaq Portable, which was compatible with the IBM PC but sufficiently differentiated, notably by being portable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. It went to great lengths to ensure compatibility with IBM's ecosystem, including software like Lotus 1-2-3, even using a cleanroom to re-implement the IBM PC BIOS code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. However, this focus on compatibility meant that [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] largely integrated existing technologies rather than innovating them internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

*   **Speed of Development**
    [[rise_and_achievements_of_compaq | Compaq]]'s product development cycle was faster (6-9 months) compared to IBM's (12-18 months), allowing it to bring new technologies to market more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. A classic example was the Deskpro 386, the first IBM PC clone with leading-edge silicon, which launched a year before IBM's comparable product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. While this initially provided a competitive edge, the increasing modularity of PCs meant that other "super-clones" could also integrate new components quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

*   **Distribution Strategy**
    [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]]'s exclusive reliance on retailers as its only distribution channel fostered strong dealer loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This saved money by avoiding a large sales force and gave dealers an advantage over IBM, which competed with its own retailers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. However, this "early advantage" eventually became a "fatal weakness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### The Attack of the Clones
By the mid-1980s, the PC ecosystem's quality improved, making it easier for new entrants to assemble compatible machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Two factors became paramount: Microsoft's OS software and Intel's silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

*   **Price Competition:** Competitors like Dell and Gateway offered equally powerful PCs at much cheaper prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This was due to cheaper materials, offshore labor, or direct-selling business models that cut out dealer markups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Consumers paid a 67% premium for a [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] compared to a similar Gateway 2000 system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Slow Response to Price Pressure:** [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] was slow to acknowledge or respond to this price pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. In December 1990, President of Compaq North America Michael Swavely insisted, "You can charge a premium price if you build the best machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. He retired just a few months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Lack of Internal Innovation:** Despite quickly integrating new technologies, [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] produced few of these innovations itself, investing only about 4% of revenues into R&D in the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This made them beholden to critical partners like Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Missed Market Opportunities:** [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] missed opportunities to open new markets, such as laptops. Despite CEO Rod Canion's personal desire for a laptop in early 1984, market research indicated a small market, and the idea was shelved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. It took until October 1988 for [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] to introduce its own laptop, the SLT, years after Toshiba had success with its T3100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This suggested the company was ill-equipped to keep up with a rapidly changing business environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## The 1991 Crisis and Rod Canion's Ousting
Despite intensifying competition, [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] continued to grow revenues and profits thanks largely to its European operations, run by Eckhard Pfeiffer, which tapped into a largely untapped market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. However, things began to go downhill in mid-1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

*   **Economic Downturn:** The First Gulf War in August 1990 caused oil shocks and a mini-recession, leading to lower company budgets and accelerating the growth of price-conscious clones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. This forced [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] to cut hardware prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   **Management Disconnect:** A growing divide emerged between [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]]'s management and its stakeholders, particularly Chairman Ben Rosen, who was concerned about the company's ability to adapt to industry changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Decline:** In May 1991, [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] pre-announced an 81% fall in Q2 1991 profits, causing its stock to drop 27% and lose $1.2 billion in market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Management, however, dismissed this as "short-term perturbations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Rod Canion's Firing:** In October 1991, [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] reported its first quarterly loss in years and announced layoffs of 12% of its workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Ben Rosen demanded a low-end PC in three months. When Rod Canion argued it was impossible without sacrificing quality, Rosen revealed that two [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] employees had assembled demo PCs from off-the-shelf parts in three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Canion's refusal to bend led to his firing, with Eckhard Pfeiffer stepping up as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## Eckhard Pfeiffer's Aggressive Turnaround and New Problems
Pfeiffer, known for his intensity and drive, immediately implemented a strategy focused on volume and low-cost PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

*   **Price War and New Products:** He launched a price war, cutting prices across the board, and unveiled 16 new products, including the low-cost ProLinea desktops and Contura laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. The cheapest 386 [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] was 50% cheaper in 1992 compared to 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   **Expanded Distribution:** Pfeiffer expanded distribution by signing deals with large computer superstores targeting home consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
*   **Initial Success:** This strategy led to a remarkable turnaround. In 1992, [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] sold 150% more computers, with revenues jumping 25% to $4.1 billion and net profits growing 63% to $213 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. By 1995, [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] became the world's largest PC maker, leapfrogging IBM and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

### A Vision and a Problem
This victory in 1995 marked the end of easy growth in the PC market, and competition, particularly from Dell, intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

*   **Distribution Dilemma:** [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] remained dependent on external distributors and retailers, preventing it from easily adopting Dell's direct-selling model that leveraged the internet to cut margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. Adopting direct sales would risk alienating its existing partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
*   **Falling Margins:** In March 1996, [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] had to drastically cut prices again, leading to razor-thin margins of 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
*   **Shift to Services:** Pfeiffer came to believe that [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]]'s future lay in becoming a global computer services company, similar to IBM, aiming for $50 billion in revenue by 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.

### [[compaqs_acquisitions_and_strategic_decisions | A Series of Unfortunate Acquisitions]]
To achieve this vision, [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] embarked on a series of costly acquisitions:

*   **Networking:** Networth (1995) and Microcom (1997) to build a networking business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.
*   **Tandem Computer:** Acquired for $4 billion in June 1997, specializing in fault-tolerant computers for 24/7 service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC):** The most significant acquisition, costing a record $9.6 billion in January 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. DEC was known for inventing the minicomputer and its legendary technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. While the acquisition turned [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] into a $38 billion giant, DEC's core businesses were struggling against competitors like [[challenges_and_decline_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.
    *   **Integration Failures:** Pfeiffer struggled to bridge the two company cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] failed to capitalize on DEC's considerable technological assets, including its Unix flavor, 64-bit RISC microprocessor (Alpha), and AltaVista, one of the major search engines of the early Dotcom era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. AltaVista was eventually sold to KPMG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.
*   **Continued PC Decline:** Throughout these acquisitions, [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]]'s core PC business continued to deteriorate. It finally adopted Dell's direct-sales model in 1998 but it was "too little, too late" to close Dell's 10-15% cost advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

## End of Pfeiffer and Michael Capellas' Tenure
In April 1999, Ben Rosen and the board fired Eckhard Pfeiffer, citing his loss of touch, expensive acquisition spree, and inability to integrate the acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. Michael Capellas, [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]]'s Chief Information Officer, was chosen as the new CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.

*   **Mixed Results:** Capellas worked to turn things around, improving gross margins and reducing expenses, but finances remained lackluster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. The core PC business continued to melt away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.
*   **Dell Overtakes Compaq:** In September 1999, Dell officially overtook [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] as the leading PC seller in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.

## The Hewlett-Packard Merger
By the year 2000, both [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] and Hewlett-Packard (HP) faced similar challenges in the commoditizing PC business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

*   **HP's Situation:** HP, a $48 billion giant, sought to transform itself under new CEO Carly Fiorina, with a mandate to move into new businesses like information system services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.
*   **Merger Proposal:** The busting Dotcom bubble in 2000 exacerbated [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]]'s struggles, leading its board to explore a merger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>. Fiorina and Capellas, both first-time CEOs facing similar turn-around challenges, bonded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. This eventually led to HP agreeing to acquire [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] in a stock swap worth about $25 billion on September 3, 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. The combined company would boast revenues of $87 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.
*   **Market Reaction:** The acquisition was widely seen as problematic. Investors and competitors were unimpressed, with the two companies losing $13 billion in market capitalization after the announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>. [[challenges_and_decline_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] President Edward Zander famously quipped, "When two sick companies combine, I'm not sure what you get" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. Michael Dell also saw it as a significant opportunity for Dell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.
*   **Internal Battle:** The acquisition deteriorated into a personal battle between Fiorina and Walter Hewlett, son of HP cofounder Bill Hewlett, who opposed the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. Fiorina eventually won shareholder approval by a thin margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.
*   **Post-Merger:** Despite initial chaos, the deal ultimately did well for shareholders. Fiorina was later dropped as CEO in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. Her successor, Mark Hurd, cut costs, laid off 15,000 jobs, and grew the combined company to over $110 billion in revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>. The [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] brand was gradually phased out, remaining on only a few low-end computers until 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.

## Conclusion
The role [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | Compaq]] played in leading the fight against IBM has largely been forgotten, with the narrative often skipping directly from IBM to Microsoft and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. This is partly due to the massive commoditization of the PC industry in the late 1990s, which was destructive not just to American PC makers but to American manufacturing in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. The shift felt inevitable as Intel and Microsoft "lorded over a fiefdom and squeezed the ecosystem for value and profits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.

Sharp Corporation, a Japanese electronics company, delivered many [[sharps_iconic_products_and_market_competition | iconic products]] over the years, including the mechanical pencil, calculators, and TVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. However, starting around the turn of the century, Sharp found itself in an increasingly competitive business, attacked by foreign competitors and facing financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This led to the company selling itself to a Taiwanese electronics giant, marking the first foreign takeover of a major Japanese consumer electronics company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Founding and Early Innovations

Sharp's founder, Takuji Hayakawa, was born in Tokyo in 1893 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. After a harsh childhood and working as an apprentice metalworker, Hayakawa opened his own metal workshop in Tokyo at age 19 with just 50 Yen of invested capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

His first invention was the "tokubido" belt buckle, which could be fastened without needing to punch holes, selling 4,752 pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

In 1915, inspired by a poorly made imported mechanical pencil, Hayakawa produced a superior version, the "Hayakawa Mechanical Pencil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This pencil became a hit due to the scarcity of German imports during World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The popularity of the pencil led to rapid business expansion, and in 1923, Hayakawa and his brother built a new factory with 200 workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### The Great Kanto Earthquake and Relocation

On September 1, 1923, the Great Kanto Earthquake struck, destroying Hayakawa's factory and leading to the tragic loss of his wife and two young children in the subsequent fires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. To compensate his pencil sales distributor, Hayakawa transferred his equipment and patents, then moved to Osaka to help them with production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. In 1924, he resolved to rebuild his business in Osaka, establishing Hayakawa Metal Laboratories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Entry into Radio and Television

Hayakawa began tinkering with the crystal radio, a new product in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Despite no prior knowledge of electricity or radio principles, he and his team reverse-engineered an imported radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. In 1925, they released their domestically assembled crystal radio, named "Sharp," which was drastically cheaper than foreign competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Its timing was perfect, coinciding with Japan's first radio program launched by the Tokyo Broadcasting Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

Recognizing the limitations of crystal radios, Hayakawa developed the "Sharp-Dyne" series of vacuum tube radios, which boosted signal power and volume, selling like hotcakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. By 1942, the company changed its name to Hayakawa Electric Company, producing various radios for consumer and military use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

In 1953, with technical assistance from RCA, Hayakawa Electric produced the TV314T, Japan's first commercially available television, just in time for NHK's first television broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Despite its high cost, its early entry secured the company's dominance in the domestic television market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Diversification and Calculators

Hayakawa Electric expanded into other product categories, releasing Japan's first microwave (R-10) and a solar-powered consumer electronics product in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The company remained a dominant solar cell producer into the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

In the 1960s, Hayakawa Electric began designing logic circuits and aiming to produce a computer, but without government support (due to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry deciding not to enroll the company into its mainframe computer development program), they focused on sophisticated non-programmable electronics like calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This contributed to [[the_history_of_japans_computer_and_software_industry | the history of Japan's computer and software industry]] through their focus on hardware.

In 1964, they released the CS-10A Compac, one of the first all-transistor calculators, which weighed 25 kilograms and cost 535,000 Yen, selling out its 300-unit supply in months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Subsequent models like the CS-20A (1965) and CS-31A (1966), the first desktop calculator using integrated circuits, made calculators cheaper, smaller, and more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. By 1966, Hayakawa led the Japanese calculator industry with 44% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

In 1970, Hayakawa Electric officially changed its name to Sharp Corporation, deriving its name from the mechanical pencil that started it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Founder Takuji Hayakawa stepped down as president that year and passed away in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## [[innovation_and_challenges_in_sharps_lcd_business | Innovation and challenges in Sharps LCD business]]

Sharp's calculator success triggered the "calculator Wars," with over 50 Japanese and various American manufacturers entering the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This intense competition pushed Sharp to innovate, leading to the development of Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

In 1969, a Sharp researcher learned about RCA's Dynamic Scattering Mode (DSM) LCD technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Although RCA declined to develop DSM LCD screens for Sharp's calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, Sharp licensed RCA's patents in 1971 and formed a team to integrate DSM LCD into a calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

In June 1973, Sharp launched the LC-Mate EL-805, a revolutionary calculator that was 12 times thinner, used 1/9000th the power, could run for 100 hours on a single charge, and weighed just 200 grams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. By 1985, Sharp had cumulatively sold over 200 million calculator units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

Sharp continued its LCD research, and in the mid-1980s, recognized IBM's identification of TFT LCD as a potential replacement for CRTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. This showcases [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | the impact of IBM on Japan's technology landscape]]. In 1987, Sharp successfully produced a 14-inch full-color, full-motion LCD display, leapfrogging competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. In 1991, they debuted the first wall-mounted television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

## Decline and Strategic Missteps

Despite its strong position in LCD technology, Sharp's overall financial health weakened in the 1990s due to Japan's economic recession, increased wages, and manufacturing offshoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Cheaper foreign imports challenged Sharp's older products, and new categories like electronic organizers failed to take off, while notebook PCs didn't generate enough profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Net income fell significantly by 1998, leading to the resignation of Sharp's president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

### The LCD Bet

With LCD panels accounting for 30% of revenues, new president Katsuhiko Machida repositioned Sharp's LCD business at its core, calling it the "crystal clear company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Sharp ditched its venerable CRT television business and went all-in on LCD televisions, launching its Aquos TV brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. This bold move initially paid off, with Aquos capturing 80% global market share in the nascent LCD TV market in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

However, intense competition from Taiwan and South Korea (e.g., Samsung, LG, Sony) rapidly emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. Samsung surprised the industry by producing leading-edge 5th-generation LCDs in early 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. In response, Sharp invested billions in new TFT LCD factories, including the massive Kamiyama plant (2004, 2006) and the Sakai factories (2007) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. These investments strained company finances, with previous financial rules restricting divisional investment waived due to LCD's perceived importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

The problem was that these massive facilities came online simultaneously with those of competitors, leading to an industry-wide oversupply in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Panel prices plummeted (a 32-inch TV panel costing $865 in 2004 fell to $149 by 2011) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. Sharp's TV market share dropped from 80% to under 10% throughout the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>, and LCD televisions became a cheap commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

Sharp's strategy to sell 50% of its panels to other TV manufacturers failed, with external sales never clearing 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. The internal conflict between Sharp's TV and display panel divisions mirrored issues seen with companies like Samsung and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. This, combined with failed partnerships (like Sony backing out of its investment in the Sakai factories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>, led to massive losses.

By March 2009, Sharp reported a net loss for the first time since going public in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. Despite admitting mistakes in local production investment, they continued to double down on LCDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. The company nearly went bankrupt in March 2012, with a net loss of over $5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

## Foxconn Acquisition

In 2012, Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn bought a 9.9% stake in Sharp and a larger share in Sakai Display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Foxconn, known for its "land and expand" business model, aimed to integrate Sharp's display technology into its supply chain, as displays are typically the most expensive component in electronic gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

Sharp initially declined a more substantial partnership or acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. Despite job cuts and a shift to selling small and medium-sized panels to smartphone makers like Xiaomi, Sharp remained in the red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. The LCD market was overcrowded, with competitors like Japan Display Inc. (JDI) adding pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. Sharp also missed critical industry transitions to new display technologies like LED-backlit LCDs and OLED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

In March 2013, a staggering $5 billion loss led to the exit of all three key leaders (Katayama, Machida, and Okuda) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. By 2013, Sharp and Fujitsu were losing their grip on the Japanese smartphone market to Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

Finally, in 2016, after three more difficult years, Sharp accepted Foxconn's offer to purchase a controlling 66% stake for $6.2 billion, though the offer was later revised down to $3.8 billion due to undisclosed financial liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. This acquisition represents the first foreign takeover of a leading Japanese electronics firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>, signifying a major event in [[mergers_and_acquisitions_involving_sharp | mergers and acquisitions involving Sharp]].

## Post-Acquisition and Future Outlook

Under its new Taiwanese CEO, Tai Jung-woo, Sharp began cutting costs, closing unprofitable overseas ventures, reducing employees, and moving production out of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. In its first full year under Taiwanese management, Sharp returned a small profit for the first time in four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Tai reoriented the company back towards producing branded electronics products and rebuilding its semiconductor manufacturing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. In February 2022, Tai retired, and a new Foxconn CEO took over, continuing the focus on brand products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

Sharp's journey highlights that while it excelled at using technology to create the right products at the right time, its over-reliance on and confidence in the superiority of its LCD technology in a brutal, low-margin, high-insecurity display panel business ultimately led to its downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. The future of the 100-year-old Sharp brand, now under Foxconn, remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.

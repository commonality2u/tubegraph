YKK stands for Yoshida Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha, which translates to Yoshida Manufacturing Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. YKK is one of the world's leading zipper manufacturers, holding approximately 90% of the Japan market and 40% of the global market by value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## The Invention and Evolution of the Modern Zipper

The device we now call a zipper, also known as a slide fastener, is used to join and bind the edges of two fabrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Early Development by Whitcomb Judson
Whitcomb Judson invented the modern slide fastener in 1891, primarily to simplify the process of buttoning and unbuttoning high-button boots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Judson, an engineer focused on pneumatic systems for public transit, considered the zipper a side project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. His business partners quickly recognized the product's potential, leading to the formation of a company that eventually transformed into [[invention_and_evolution_of_the_modern_zipper | Talon Inc.]], the original zipper company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Gideon Sunback's Innovations
Around 20 years later, Talon hired Gideon Sunback, a Swedish-American electrical engineer, who became their head engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Sunback dedicated years to improving the fastener design, focusing on reliability and manufacturability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. In 1917, he patented the "hookless number two," a fastener featuring the interlocking teeth structure seen in modern zippers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Crucially, Sunback also invented a machine capable of efficiently producing this design, which was vital for its widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Naming and Early Adoption
Initially, Talon struggled to convince textile companies to adopt their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Zippers found early use in military items like soldiers' belts, life vests, and sleeping bags during World War I, and also in tobacco bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The term "zipper" emerged in 1923 when B.F. Goodrich used it for a rubber boot product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This boot significantly boosted demand, leading Talon's factory to focus solely on zipper production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Talon was displeased with the generic term "zipper" because they could not control it, even running ads to encourage calling their product "Talon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

Despite the boot's success, Talon faced challenges in getting garment manufacturers to incorporate zippers, as they were more expensive, lacked color options, and were perceived as heavy and difficult to integrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Talon targeted specific markets like women's girdles and men's work clothing, included zippers in home sewing kits, hired a sales force, and held fashion shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. These efforts gradually paid off, with Talon producing over 200 million zippers by 1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Tadao Yoshida: Early Life and Founding of YKK

Tadao Yoshida was born in 1908 in Uozu City, Toyama Prefecture, Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Growing up in a poor family, Yoshida undertook small businesses to earn pocket money, such as selling birds and fishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Despite excelling in school, he could not afford to continue his studies past age 15, so he worked at a rubber boot shop and studied in his spare time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

In 1928, at age 20, Yoshida moved to Tokyo with 70 yen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, intending to "do big business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. He found a job at Furia Shoten, an import store selling Chinese ceramics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. When the Sino-Japanese War made importing Chinese ceramics impossible, the store shifted to selling slide fasteners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The store eventually closed, and Furia's owner advised Yoshida to manage the remaining zipper inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

In January 1934, at 25 years old, Yoshida started his own store, San-S Shokai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. He took over Furia's inventory and partnered with another zipper maker in Osaka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Recognizing that over half of zippers were defective, Yoshida focused on quality control, even testing zippers by hitting them with a hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. To ensure better quality, his shop began producing its own zippers in a metal factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. However, this factory was destroyed by Allied bombing in March 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

After Japan's defeat, Yoshida returned to Tokyo and met an American considering exporting Japanese products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Yoshida presented his best zippers, but the American found their quality inferior and price too high compared to American fasteners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Zipper Manufacturing Process and Components

Zippers consist of three main components: the tape, the teeth (elements), and the slider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The teeth intermesh to open and close the zipper, forming a "chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The slider moves along the elements to lock or unlock them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The tape is the fabric part to which the teeth are attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

For a metal zipper, the process starts with pre-made Y-shaped metal wire, often a copper-zinc alloy for rust resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. A tiny chip is sheared off the wire to become an element, then a hook-like protrusion (scoop) is forged into it to catch teeth and keep the zipper closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Finally, the element's two legs are bent to attach it to the tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This process requires mechanical automation for economic and effective production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## YKK's Rise to Dominance

Yoshida recognized that American-made "chain machines," costing $30,000 to $40,000, were essential for achieving the desired zipper quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. After considerable effort, he secured an import license and a 12 million yen loan to import four chain machines in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Automation and Innovation
These imported machines, which arrived in 1950, provided YKK with a significant competitive advantage, allowing six workers to do the work of 160 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Yoshida immediately ordered 100 replicas from a Japanese machine company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. In 1953, YKK improved the machines to attach elements at regular time intervals, eliminating the need for spacers and greatly speeding up manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Further improvements made the machines easier for a single person to operate and increased production volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### Vertical Integration
Yoshida and YKK strongly believed in [[zipper_manufacturing_process_and_components | vertical integration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. In 1954, Yoshida began work on the Kurobe Factory, an integrated campus designed to produce everything from the metal wire to the textiles for the tapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This philosophy extended overseas, with YKK USA factories melting their own brass, creating their own polyester, and weaving their own zipper tapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Yoshida argued that controlling raw material production provided advantages in developing new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

YKK's automation prowess, ability to produce their own machines, and control over the entire supply chain led to their market leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. By 1958, YKK produced enough zippers to encircle the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Competition with Talon and Global Expansion

The decline of [[invention_and_evolution_of_the_modern_zipper | Talon Inc.]] and the rise of YKK accelerated around 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. In 1971, Talon held 70% of the market, which dropped to 35% by 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

YKK's success wasn't solely due to a lack of import restrictions on foreign zippers, as YKK was already producing zippers in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. After an initial failure to enter the U.S. market in 1955, YKK began importing zipper parts and assembling them in the U.S. in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. In 1974, a year before Talon's failed petition for import restrictions, YKK opened a vertically integrated factory in Macon, Georgia, producing zippers from raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This factory remains in operation, and YKK zippers from there are marked "made in the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

YKK expanded globally by following textile manufacturers to low-cost labor regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Today, YKK has factories in 71 countries, building locally to overcome tariff barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. YKK's control of its supply chain provided the agility to challenge Talon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

Talon's decline was also self-inflicted. In 1968, Textron, an industrial conglomerate, acquired Talon for $200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Textron's owners, who were brand managers rather than textile experts, lacked the experience to maintain the company's competitive edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Talon lost market share in industrial garments and its profitable home sewing kit niche declined as more women entered the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. They also failed to adapt to new fashion trends that favored freer, more colorful clothes made from stretchy synthetic fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

In contrast, YKK offered innovations like the concealed zipper, which hides the teeth by blending into the garment, and plastic injection mold zippers that could be dyed into vibrant colors, appealing to new fashion trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Talon was eventually sold by Textron and is now owned by Tag It Pacific Inc., primarily producing in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

## The Modern Zipper Market

The [[global_zipper_market_and_ykks_dominance | global zipper market]] is divided into high, middle, and low-end sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **High-end Luxury:** Dominated by European brands like Riri (Switzerland) and Lampo (Italy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **Low-end:** Controlled by manufacturers in China or India who compete solely on price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Middle to High-end Fashion:** YKK operates primarily in this segment, generating about 80% of its approximately $6 billion annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

### Competition in the Middle Market
In recent years, YKK has faced substantial competition from Fujian SBS Zipper, a Chinese company founded in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. SBS Zipper, whose founder started as a middleman testing zipper quality similar to Yoshida, aggressively produces cheap but high-quality zippers for mid-fashion garment manufacturers like Zara, Target, and Michael Kors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. While SBS's revenue is about $300 million USD, far less than YKK's, it presents a direct challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. In response, YKK has focused on producing higher-quality luxury zippers and aggressively expanding its manufacturing presence in China to compete on SBS's home turf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

The evolution of the zipper demonstrates that manufacturing can be as technologically sophisticated as any software application, with immense research and development behind advancements often taken for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

[[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han ethnic supremacy]] is an emerging point of concern on China's internet and cultural backwaters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While easily dismissed as fringe views, these are real people expressing real opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This troubling trend raises questions about the definition of "Han" and its historical interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Defining "Han" Ethnicity

The concept of "Han" is a complex and fluid one, akin to defining "white" in America, where definitions have changed over time (e.g., Italians, Irish, Jewish not initially considered white) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. To be Han is not about a distinct nationality, ethnicity, or race, but a constructed bundle of items like Confucian values or adherence to certain rites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It's often described as an "I know it when I see it" kind of thing, evidenced by the existence of groups like the Hakka and Cantonese within the broader Han umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

However, [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacists]] disregard this nuance, viewing "Han-ness" as a single, mono-race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. They assert that Han people are the "core race in China," whose interests are "one in one with those of China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. They claim a "5,000 years of direct racial inheritance" and "one of the purest" bloodlines in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

In reality, Han people are genetically a "deeply intermixed breed," having migrated and mixed for generations across China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This intermixing is common for all races globally, but "Han more so than usual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Han Nationalism and Dynastic Shifts

For over the past 1,000 years, China has been ruled longer by foreigners than by members of its own Han people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. [[han_cultural_movements_and_their_implications | Han nationalism]] played a key role in toppling the Qing Dynasty, leading to the establishment of both the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Centuries of rule by the Manchu people, an ethnic minority, grated against the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Chinese elites seeking power would rail against the "furry and horned" Manchu, aiming to unite the "pure Han race" against their enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

When the ROC came to power, Sun Yat-sen recognized that continued feelings of [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacy]] would divide the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Observing other World War I-era empires with significant minority populations, like Russia and Austria-Hungary, splitting apart, Sun sought to avoid a similar fate for Qing-era China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Thus, Sun and other Kuomintang founders promoted racial harmony as a core tenet of ROC rule, symbolized by the five-colored flag and the principle of "five races under one union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. While the ROC at times advocated for a single unified Chinese race, [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han ethnocentrism]] remained a persistent issue for governance and the suppression of ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Policies and Ethnic Minorities

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) garnered significant support from China's ethnic minorities, who were disillusioned with their position in the Republic of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Mao Zedong himself held strong views on the value of China's ethnic minorities, condemning past Han-dominated rulers for sowing estrangement and bullying minority peoples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. He advocated for extensive and sustained education on the "proletarian nationality policy" and frequent reviews of the relationship between Han and minority nationalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Consequently, the PRC prioritizes ethnic minority and racial harmony for both ideological and practical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Although not known for gender equality, the CCP has commendably promoted high-performing cadres from ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

The CCP actively created and codified China's ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. In the 1950s, teams were dispatched to locate, classify, and protect non-Han ethnic cultures, resulting in the recognition of 56 separate nationalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The People's Congress then crafted affirmative action policies and preferential treatment to help China's minorities achieve an even level with the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. These benefits include:

*   Regional ethnic autonomous states within China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
*   Dedicated museums, parks, schools, events, and authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
*   Preferential treatment in China's national testing exam (Gaokao), where minorities in western China might need 200 points compared to 500 for Han people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>
*   An exception to the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>

Similar policies are reflected in Taiwan, where members of recognized aboriginal tribes receive comparable benefits in college exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. These policies were introduced to address significant income, wealth, and employment gaps between ethnic minorities and the Han majority, which persist over generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Han Resentment and Cultural Movements

Despite their intent, these affirmative action policies have largely failed to close the generation gaps and have instead cultivated resentment from the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. From the Han perspective, they are the "crucial driver of the Chinese nation and its glorious history" but are not treated the same as ethnic minorities; in fact, they are seen as "part of the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

Such views have found strong adherence in the dark corners of the Chinese internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Dozens of [[han_cultural_movements_and_their_implications | Han culture]] forums and websites have emerged in China, Taiwan, and the overseas Chinese diaspora, such as the now-closed "Han Now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. These groups advocate for the revitalization of certain aspects of Chinese [[han_cultural_movements_and_their_implications | Han culture]], rejecting others for their non-Han origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

A prominent example is clothing: netizens opposed China encouraging Qing-era clothing like the Manchu *chi pao* or *makwa* (horse jacket), instead advocating for the *Han Fu* clothing worn before what they called "alien rule" (referring to the Manchu conquest of the Ming Dynasty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The *Han Fu* movement went mainstream, partially because the clothes "look cute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. While for many, it remained "just nice cosplay," the *Han Fu* movement and similar sites promoting [[han_cultural_movements_and_their_implications | Han culture]] eventually served as a "gateway drug for harder versions of [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

## Historical Revisionism and Manchu Dislike

[[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han ethnocentrists]] hold a special dislike for the Manchu people, vigorously fighting to revise views of the Qing and Yuan dynasties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. They paint the Qing Dynasty and its Manchu leaders as bloodthirsty, claiming they rolled back the Ming Dynasty's progressive advancements, stole Han wealth, butchered the Han people, and made China a "backwards country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This, they argue, allowed the West to advance and eventually invade, making the Manchu "colonists, same as the British in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. They cite historical records of countless deaths related to the Qing conquest of the Ming Dynasty to support their claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

However, this is a gross oversimplification. The Qing conquest of the Ming Dynasty was a long, complicated series of wars, often involving Han fighting against Han <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Boiling it down to "bad Manchu victimizing innocent Han" is a clear case of "hijack[ing] history for your own purposes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The goal of this historical revisionism is to reject the celebration of some 300 years of China's history and pin its decline on a "foreign face," absolving the Han of any blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, implying "the Han did everything right, the Manchu were the ones who got it all wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

## Modern Grievances and Social Tensions

The CCP's affirmative action policies, while well-intentioned, face legitimate criticism and online grief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Many perceive a "quiet deal" where ethnic minorities receive special privileges in exchange for not pursuing independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The two policies causing the most resentment are the preferential national examination thresholds and the exemption from the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

The one-child policy exemption has led to an increase in the proportion of ethnic minorities in China, from 3% in 1949 to 8% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. While 1.2 billion Han Chinese still exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, to the [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacist]], this makes Han people the "only country in the world with the people conducting their own self-destruction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Coupled with easier exam thresholds, a perception persists that "there are more ethnic minorities running around and they are dumber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

Incidents of ethnic violence also fuel [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacist]] views. For example, the late 2000s riots in Urumqi triggered a massive upsurge in anti-minority sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. A common complaint was that ethnic minorities could attack Han people or rob them, and authorities would seemingly "keep letting them do it in the name of national unity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Parallels and Challenges

China's ethnic minority problems present significant challenges for the government, similar to those faced by other nations with diverse populations, such as the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. While China is often seen as a "one race monolith," it grapples with internal ethnic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

Like America's founding fathers attempting to bind diverse peoples under concepts of freedom and pursuit of happiness (though reality often fell short), China faces a similar ideological divide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. One school of thought advocates inclusiveness, where individuals can be accepted into Chinese society and even the Han race by practicing values like Confucianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This view promotes China as a "nation of many races and we are all in this together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

However, a darker school of thought advocates for an "inherent gap between the Han people and the barbarians," a label with deep historical significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. To them, "other races are born barbarians," their blood is barbarian, and attempts to assimilate them would be a "fool's errand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

These issues are not confined to mainland China, but are present in areas with significant Han majorities such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Chinese diaspora communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. China and Singapore are the only Han-majority countries with substantial minority populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The Chinese government has attempted to manage these concerns and foster cross-ethnic unity by creating an "us of China versus them of the West" mentality, encouraging a level of acceptable anti-foreign energy to suppress [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. While this tactic might work in the short term, its long-term health is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

[[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacism]] is not just a niche or online phenomenon; it is a serious and widespread problem, partly because it's "easy to get seduced by this sort of creed to say that oh you are part of this supreme race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
